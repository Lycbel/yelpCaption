It's one of those restaurants that tourists always try to eat at when they come visit Chicago (along with girl & the goat, publican, wild berry, au cheval, etc). So I thought I'd finally give it a try. My boyfriend and I opted for an early dinner and came at 5pm on a Sunday night because we really did not want to have to wait for a table. They had a table for two inside but we decided to sit outside since it was a milder winter evening (upper 30s). They do have heat lamps outside. Still chilly but we kept our coats on. It was much more peaceful outside. The small inside space makes it really loud and hard to have conversation. Service was good. <br><br>The waiter recommended ordering 3-4 plates to share between 2 people. We ordered the following:<br>- Crispy pig's ears $15- kale, pickled cherry peppers, fried egg<br>- Milk braised Berkshire shoulder $19- mashed potatoes, crispy lentils<br>- Seared scallops $20- creamy polenta, Romesco + charred ramps<br>- Octopus a la plancha $23- green beans, fingerling potatoes, salsa verde<br><br>All of these were popular plates that the waiter recommended except for the scallops (we just love scallops). The crispy pig's ears, arguably one of the purple pig's most popular dishes, was too salty for my liking. The milk braised Berkshire shoulder was very tender. The seared scallops were good but there were only 2. A bit pricey for just two scallops. The octopus was on the oily side without enough flavor. <br><br>Overall, I was a bit underwhelmed by this popular, highly ranked restaurant. Worth a try, but with all the other good restaurants in Chicago, I probably won't revisit this one.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/28rYOjLa_SSseqZQp7bfkA/348s.jpg", "caption": "Crispy pig's ears"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DcKD1iuHfimT2tiUhjmPXQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Scallops"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6DKcBwdCd3rxXU09qEwwag/168s.jpg", "caption": "Octopus a la plancha"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "I have nothing but good things to say about The Purple Pig.

My friends and I came by on a Saturday for brunch. We placed our name, walked around, and was called to our table in a little over an hour. Luckily since The Purple Pig is so centrally located, we were able to walk around and explore the city during that time.<br><br>The restaurant is crowded with a lot of communal tables. The family-knit atmosphere follows with the family-style of sharing multiple dishes though. Between the four of us, we shared 6 dishes, which was the perfect amount. My favorites had to be the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder ($19) and Chicken Thigh Kebabs ($17). The pork shoulder was perfectly cooked and just fell off the bone. The tenderness of the meat paired so smoothly with the pureed mashed potatoes for this divine consistency. As for the chicken kebabs, they came in huge pieces grilled on a skewer on top of beautifully roasted potatoes. The potatoes were so crispy, yet soft that just made every bite so heavenly. I'd definitely get these two dishes again.<br><br>We also ordered the Crispy Pig's Ears ($15), which is one of their most popular dishes. It comes topped with a sunnyside egg to mixed into the crispy pig ears and veggies. This was a nice dish with a sour twist, but didn't stand out as much to me. The Grilled Broccoli ($13) was a very unique take of the vegetable with a crispy yet creamy texture in a hint of sour taste as well. This was a favorite amongst our table.<br><br>Our last two dishes were the Olive Oil Poached Tuna ($12) and Stuffed Squid ($16). The tuna was so vividly colorful in a beautiful presentation from the purple potatoes, green beans, red peppers, yellow quail eggs, and of course the pink tuna. This was a fun and tasteful dish to try! Now although the squid was good, it came with only 3 pieces. It was also stuffed, so made splitting between 4 people a bit of a mess.<br><br>Overall, delicious and unique spot on various types of menu items.

I didn't really like the salsa verde; it had a strong mint flavor.<br><br>+ Milk-Braised Berkshire Pork Shoulder: the meat was super tender for sure, and overall this was a good dish but it didn't wow me like the beets and eggplant caponata.

The assemble process of the perfect bite could be a little bit messy but the rewards you get from it will be well worth the effort. Personally, I am not a huge fun of the crispy pig ear (my friend loved it). It was definitely not bad, but as a Chinese I have my own favorite ways to enjoy pig ears. My friend laughed at me when I ordered the gnocchi, but hands down, it was the best gnocchi I've ever had.

Little bits of cripsy fried goodness that will make you want more and more each bite. Did I mention how amazing the kale was in this? If only my Kale at home turns out this good each time I try to make kale. Must order if you're into getting an alternative to fries. <br><br>-Grilled octopus - Probably my favorite dish of the meal.

On this occasion, it was defintel a hit. Braised well and so tender, this would have been the perfect protein to eat with just a nice service of white rice. You can taste the love in the shoulder and the time spent ensuring the texture is just right. Some reviews state this was a tad bit too salty, for us it was just right. Come to say, we had leftovers of this dish and the BF and I ate it cold in the airport a few hours later and it tasted even better. The perfect roast. <br><br>-Grilled Broccoli - You can go really wrong with veggies--especially for certain restaurants to focus on meat. Not here.

Promise me you'll order them, or else you will miss out on the most beautiful flavors. <br><br>We started with the bone marrow. This dish was simplicity at its best. You can just spread the marrow on the toasted bread like butter. The capers on the top perfectly balanced out the fatty and greasy marrow. All of these ingredients made a wonderful food melody. One bite, and I was in heaven. <br><br>We were then served with the grilled octopus. As I've said multiple times -- I'm a huge octopus fan. This dish is for sure among the best octopus I've had. The octopus was grilled to form a crispy crust, while the inner part was still tender. The sauce also elevated the flavor, adding a touch of freshness to the dish. <br><br>Last but certainly not least, we had the grilled broccoli. This dish could even make a hater love broccoli. It's that GOOD. I didn't even feel like I was eating vegetables. Can you believe that we finished off this dish first? Hahaha<br><br>I don't want to be grumpy... but there are just too many people lol. Every time I go there, I have to wait for at least an hour.

Took one look at the food constantly coming out of the kitchen, so there was only one choice, to wait. <br><br>Then we saw a table for two in the covered outside area and we're told it's close to the door so might be cold.

But on both attempts that I've visited, I've either been able to sit right away (for 2) on a Saturday night at 5pm, or like last night, was told it would be a 1.5hr wait and ended up being 15mins (for 3) at 7pm on a weekday. <br><br>Seating ranges from private tables to communal to barside and standing room only. Theme is Mediterranean tapas but some of the seafood, pork and beef dishes are full-sized entrees. Price points are more than fair and reasonable for the quality. Perfect location to impress a date or friends visiting from out of town.<br><br>Ordered the Buttersquash Empanadas (black truffle oil, squash, cheese filling with apple sauce demiglaze and the cutest melted marshmallow pillow on a cinnamon stick), Pork Ossabuco, Red Snapper on red cabbage sauce, Octopus with potatoes and asparagus, and a Fried Hash & Chorizo dish I cannot remember the name of.<br><br>Aside from that last dish, I would order any of the dishes again. Food comes out promptly in no particular order (per host) and piping hot. I broke my pescetarian fast and had some of the Ossabuco - it was heavenly! The meat pulled off the bone so easily and the goblets of fat melted in your mouth. It was generously doused with tomato and polenta sauces. The Octopus was one of the best dishes I've ever had. Extemely tender and meaty inside but nicely charred on the outside. Red snapper was fresh, nicely charred and delish with a red cabbage sauce that was tart and sweet at the same time (looked and tasted akin to poi, lol). The Empanadas were also yummy, just consider this a dessert rather than an appetizer. <br><br>It was fun to eye all the orders next to my party bc every dish looked amazing. Only regret was not being able to try the dessert menu bc I was stuffed. <br><br>Aside: I rarely comment on the service of an eatery bc it's about the food, not having my ego stroked. However I would like to say that it was my last meal in town, and I had brought my luggage bag with me. The host was kind enough to store the bag in a discrete corner during my meal. However, the manager/person walking the floors in glasses took one look at my bag in that corner, sneered and asked what it was doing there. Host said it was a luggage piece, manager sneered again and said \"I know, what's that doing there?\" And I was right in front of him the whole time. Way to make me feel low and ashamed of being a tourist trying to squeeze in a last good meal before heading to the airport.

So even though I came here by myself for work, I decided to stop by on a Tuesday at 3 pm. Surprisingly the place was completely full but I snagged a seat at the bar. I ordered the most popular thing on yelp, the pork shoulder, and asked for a recommendation for a side vegetable or salad. The bartender recommended the broccoli. The pork shoulder was good, but not the most amazing I've had. The broccoli was not good at all, too sour with way too much sauce so I couldn't eat it at all. I was pleasantly surprised when they didn't end up charging me for it. One star added for that. <br><br>Overall my experience wasn't amazing, but I think it's because I was alone.

The cheese plate was great. Our server, Mauro checked on us and noticed I hadn't drank much of my drink. I told him I didn't really care for it, he took it off our ticket and asked me what else I wanted.  How observant and sweet. <br>We ended up ordering the morcilla and lobster and the spare ribs.  Everything was delicious and we got to try a new spin in yummy food. <br><br>The communal seating allowed us to chat with the couple in front of us and the people next to us.

Chicago's Purple Pig is the quintessential new American, foodie-centered, trendy-casual, hyped up, hour-long-wait restaurant serving unique and fun creations ranging from crisp Brussels sprouts to pig ears to cured meat and cheese boards. With the motto \"Cheese, swine, and wine\" and a branded gate entrance alongside the river, it's difficult not to be captivated by the restaurant's charm.<br><br>They don't take reservations, but there is a decently sized covered tarp with heating (!) and tall tables where you can order appetizers and drinks. You can also go for a walk and check out downtown (including the impressive candy store), because they have a nice texting system that gives you 10 minutes to return and claim your table.<br><br>My biggest issue with the Purple Pig is the perpetual first world problem of the difficulties deciding what to order. The menu has a large selection of interesting offerings, and this is one of those places you want to return to multiple times before officially crossing it off your bucket list.<br><br>(++) Assortment of locally foraged mushrooms ($15): In my mind I had the image of a purple pig on a leash foraging for truffles and rare mushrooms. While the mushrooms where less bouge than truffles, it was a satisfying dish with the variety of succulent mushrooms. The hearty, earthy taste paired with the tart (purple!) berry sauce was a subtle surprise. <br><br>(+++) Pork spare ribs with BBQ sauce + farro ($18): Omg this is possibly the most meticulously fine-tuned ribs I've ever had. The meat is so tender it appears to fall off the bone spontaneously, and the flavors are robust with prominent smokey tones, with hints of bacon and ham. I thought the thick overlaying sauce would be overwhelming, but the mix of BBQ sauce and creamy yogurt-like drizzle added dimensions of familiarity and novelty. Not sure if I could go back to plain old BBQ ribs now.<br><br>(++) Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes + puffed farro ($19): This was a fascinating dish with the pork so tender and mashed potatoes so creamy, it is of molten consistency that melts in your mouth. It is rather indulgent but not too unbearably rich, because they creatively use pork shoulder infused with milk rather than fatty pork belly. Intriguingly, the only contrast is the topping of crispy puffed farro.<br><br>Portions are surprisingly big, and the food is quite filling.

Surprisingly, the line was OK and there were only 10+ people in front of us. We were able to get seated in the first round of seat assignments right after opening. <br><br>The first thing to mention about Purple Pig is their amazing collection of drinks, ranging from cocktails, different kinds of wines and beers. Based on their menus, they have over 100 options of drinks. Besides, they also offer the wine/beer of the month to highlight their seasonal offerings. I had an Oktoberfest beer (local Pale Ale, the beer of the month) and it had a very fresh and thick taste. I enjoyed it a lot and highly recommend to get a drink here.<br><br>The advantage of having a group of six was that we got to try all kinds of things at Purple Pig. Besides the famous pork shoulder and pork marrow, we also tried pork chops, pork sandwich, sausages plus cheese, etc.. As we also spotted that every table ordered the cornbread, we also went ahead with one to share. Indeed, you would not be disappointed by this cornbread: very soft and creamy, with an extra flavor of honey in it. It opened up your appetite right away. Different from most of the reviews, I am not too keen about their pork shoulder and marrow. The pork shoulder was indeed very well-cooked and soft. However, the natural flavor of the pork was completely overshadowed by the creamy stew/sauce on top of it. You got quite stuffed by the creaminess. At the same time, the pork marrow was actually something I felt worth trying, in other words, a tourist dish. The marrow itself was flavorless. With the bread and salt, you started to feel the fine texture of the marrow and it tasted mostly like a light butter. While it is for sure worth tasting, I didn't find anything in particular that would make this dish popular with non-first-time customers. The presence of all the dishes was great, very well-decorated with colorful sauces and small nuts and vegetables.<br><br>Overall, I really enjoyed the dining experience at the Purple Pig.

Grilled broccoli - grilled with roasted garlic, drizzled with anchovy vinaigrette, topped with breadcrumbs. The vegetable is grilled to perfection with the broccoli crowns being soft and the stalks soft and crunchy. The vinaigrette may have been a bit too much and made the dish more salty. Maybe a little less and it would've been better. <br><br>2. Crispy pig ears - don't let the name scare you. Crunchy pieces and the sunny side up egg, kale, and pickled peppers enhances the flavor and gives you different tastes as you eat your way through the plate. <br><br>3. Roasted bone marrow - AMAZING!!! Fatty, buttery goodness! It's a must try!<br>Pair it with a Chianti Classico to cleanse your palate and enjoy each bite as if it were your first time eating. <br><br>4. Sicilian Iris - this is their popular dessert. It takes a while to make and comes in hot so careful on the first bite. Its like a fried donut stuffed with ricotta and chocolate and topped with confectionary sugar. Pair it with a dry Madeira for your dessert drink. <br><br>Overall, the food is great! You can't go wrong with their food.

I think the dish used to be a little bit less salty, but I still enjoy it with the bread although I use very little salt if any at all that they provide. I also enjoy the razor clams, it's nicely flavored with a bit of lemon and olive oil. The milk braised pork shoulder although not my jam (it's a bit heavy for my tastes with the mashed potato and milk sauce) is delicious for a lot of other people that I've brought with the pork shoulder being so tender and braised that it falls apart and sort of melts in your mouth (for pork anyway) a great comfort food. Other standouts that I've had include the chicken kebabs with the chicken being perfectly tender and the tzatziki sauce really adding to it with a Mediterranean taste. <br><br>The rotating desserts are always a delight too. My favorite by far is this pistachio creme brulee I've had in the past, but as I said rotating. I hope Purple Pig brings this back because I dream about having it again all the time and I don't even like pistachios!! Of course the Sicilian Iris is always a classic, sometimes when their chef isn't it in they won't make it though? it takes roughly 20 minutes (or so they say, usually it comes out faster) and is well worth the wait with the ooey gooey chocolate and ricotta.

They don't take reservations, so come early to avoid waiting in line! They were pretty busy at noon on a Friday, and since we came a few minutes before, we were able to grab one of the last tables for a party of 5. It was partially communal seating, since we sat at one end of a larger table, but there were some empty seats between the two parties. They have an extensive menu, and portion sizes vary between the dishes. We tried:<br><br>-Salt Roasted Beets (Whipped Goat Cheese, Pistachio Butter, $11, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=K7bUEDQ2LhLRKXIZsocfEQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>): Yum- I love beets, and they roasted the beets perfectly. It went well with the whipped goat cheese and pistachio butter, and this was a huge serving- recommended!<br>-Stuffed Squid (Prosciutto, Breadcrumbs, Santorini Fava Purée, Charmoula, $15, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=NmgOjtCMUVMs6N8FAIbyIA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>): The squid is nice and tender, and this dish was very flavorful. I don't eat very salty, so this dish was borderline salty for me.<br>-Crispy Pig's Ear (Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers, Fried Egg, $13, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=aYAbD24is9TzoLt4TYgxAw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>): The crispy pig's ears were sliced a little too thinly for me, but it had a good crisp. I wish they added more flavors to the pig's ears instead of a fried egg, since that didn't do anything for this dish. However, the kale was delicious, and super crispy. This dish is worth trying once.<br>-Fried Pizza Neapolitan (Bufala Mozzarella, Radicchio, Fig, Balsamic, $14, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=3KPMHAMwmUs-DMuj9a5Vgw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>): This dish looked and sounded amazing, but the fried pizza dough was very plain. The ingredients didn't quite come together for me, and I probably wouldn't order this again.<br>-Housemade Meatballs (Green Garlic, Ricotta, Toasted Brioche, $13, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=SvNfzXiSUytZXTa7d_DXNA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>): Solid meatballs, and they were soft/fluffy on the inside with a nice sear on the outside.

The burrata is whipped I believe so it was very fluffy and light. The dish only comes with two medium sized cannolis so it's definitely not a filling appetizer and its a bit pricy for the amount you receive.

We were lucky to only have to wait about 15 mins for seats so if you plan to come on a more popular day or time you will need reservations.

Myself and one of my friends decided to create our own cheese and meat tray after seeing the high quality and variety of the cheeses offered.

For our meats we picked the <br>chorizo, capocollo, and an Italian style prosciutto. The board came with baked pita crackers, an apple puree, cranberry jam, and a nut and honey mixture that tasted just like baklava. Each of the cheese had amazing flavors that truly amazed me.

You will likely encounter at least a small wait, but between the communal tables and large bar it's nothing drastic. So don't let the constant crowd scare you away from stopping in here! <br><br>We waited about 15-20 to sit at the bar. This turned out to be awesome because the bartender knows what's up and you get to see them plating all the dishes. Lots of food porn goin on back there. It's a small operation with everything in fresh everyday, and all the employees are passionate about the eats. <br><br>Onto the food - we got the beets and deviled egg (pictured) braised pork shoulder and a variety of cheese/cured meats. <br><br>Def order the beets - I don't even love beets and went APE on this dish, as you can see. When you mix all the diff elements together you got what is similar to a pb&j flavor. Do it. <br><br>The deviled egg - meh. A deviled egg is never a terrible idea, but in the realm of snacks they offer here you can skip this. Underwhelming. <br><br>We also got the braised pork shoulder which is delicious and filling. My bf did most of the work on that - it is a heavy dish, but it will certainly hit the spot if you're up for that kind of a thanksgiving-appropriate dish. <br><br>They also have a fab wine list. <br><br>TIP: the food comes out in a super speedy fashion.

It was a nice veggie addition to our meal and one with very unique flavors that you don't normally associate with broccoli, but it works. Sadly, towards the end of the dish, I felt a bit heavy which isn't something I ever though I would associate with a green veggie.

When my husband ordered it, I was honestly very apprehensive because who eats pig ears? It sounds kind of gross, but I was pleasantly surprised as I fought him for the very last bites. It had a sunnyside egg on top of crispy fried pig ears tossed with these perfectly pickled cherry peppers which added great flavor to the dish. I loved the contrast of the crispy pig ears to the peppers, it was like magic in my mouth with every bite. The only downside of this dish was that the kale was on the more oily side and was not edible by itself because it was soaked in oil. Overall, this was an almost perfect dish 4/5. <br>- Grilled octopus $20 - this was the highlight of our meal! It seriously is A MUST TRY. I repeat A MUST TRY!!!! Words cannot describe how delicious and addicting this dish is. I know I probably sound like a broken record, but it really was the perfect balance of flavors and textures with each bite better than the previous leaving you wanting for more. 5/5+ stars. <br>- Milk braised pork shoulder $19- the pork was the most incredibly tender, moist, and perfectly seasoned piece of pork I have ever had. The mashed potatoes underneath were so smooth and tasted like air. It also had these crispy bits of pork? that really added to the dish. It was remarkable how the chef was able to capture so many flavors and different textures in that dish.

We got that text about an hour after waiting and had 10 minutes to check in.<br><br>We were seated at a shared high-top table. We ordered and shared everything family style: <br>-Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese + Pistachio Butter: My favorite dish here. I'm a huge fan of beets in general. They are clean, colorful, and really well complimented by the goat cheese and pistachio butter. Wait, backup.. pistachio butter. Who knew that was a thing? But it is a very, very good thing. I was the girl licking the plate clean of it.<br><br>-Broccoli with Roasted Garlic, Toasted Breadcrumbs + Anchovy Vinaigrette: What better way to make broccoli less broccoli-like than to smother it with garlic and breadcrumbs. Solid side dish.<br><br>-Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes + Puffed Farro: The boys in my group loved this dish, but I actually thought it was way too salty. The meat was extra tender, but I just couldn't handle the sodium level on this one so the boys got extras.<br><br>-Roasted Bone Marrow with Herb Salad + Sicilian Sea Salt: Oh hello, fatty bone marrow. This dish is decadent and does just enough to please the tastebuds. <br><br>-Cured Meats and Cheese Platter, chef's choice: A great platter for sharing. We were able to try a lot of variety with this one. <br><br>The ambiance is a bit chaotic, but the servers were able to deliver our food in a fairly efficient manner (and cleanup was even faster).<br><br>Soo, the beets and the bone marrow are winners. But I really wish I had been wow-ed by the Purple Pig, and I wasn't. I do think some of the dishes being overly salted was a big turnoff for me.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Ok, the food here is amazing!  Creative, tasty, and well plated.  Our party of 5 loved every bite!  The wine list is great, too.  <br><br>Now.... to the caveat for OUR group- the venue is CROWDED and VERY loud.  We were seated outside which was not as loud, but still was not optimum for us.  My 85 yo mom struggled with the bar stool like seats; her hearing aids were going bonkers.

By the time we left, the place was packed as well as the patio. Their wine and beer list is impressive, and their cocktails are solid as well. The cooks were working at a furious pace as the kitchen is open and the line was elbow to elbow. I started out with a warpigs from three Floyd's and my friend had a dark and stormy. Then we ordered. The bartender was helpful with his recommendations, but we kind of decided to go in a different direction but appreciated the thoughtfulness and professionalism. He also knew the menu and what each dish was composed of. We started out with the jlt, with jowel and frisée, tomato and a sunny side up duck egg. It was awesome and probably my favorite dish of the night. The yolk was perfect. We then ordered the bone marrow, which came with grilled brioche and a citrus herb salad and a little sea salt. Again, very well executed and very flavorful. Simple, clean and fresh. We then had the calamari last, and we were pleasantly surprised that it was a cold antipasto. It was fresh and vibrant and the calamari was tender and cooked perfectly. Overall, it was a very impressive experience from start to finish.

Yes, it was a busy Saturday night so I tend to cut restaurants a little slack for that but it was truly a comedy of mis-steps and errors! <br><br>1) As I approached the tent door from<br>Michigan Avenue I was stopped by a man who asked if I had a reservation. When I told him no, he literally said \"well if you're hungry you should know there's a two hour wait unless you sit at the bar\" - it was almost as though he was out there to discourage patrons from entering!!<br><br>Well I decided to take my chances at the bar and went up to order a drink. <br><br>2) The bartender informed me he would not be able to serve me until I had a seat. So I stood there with ice water (which at least he offered while I was waiting) and a seat opened in less than 20 minutes.  It took another 10 minutes for the bartender to clear the plates of who left and acknowledge me sitting at the bar. It took me waiving and asking for a menu. First he only handed me the wine book, I had to separately ask for the food menu. Very strange in a place with such popularity!<br><br>3) I inquired about a few menu items then ordered the recommended seasonal octopus and the butternut squash soup along with a lovely glass of Italian Barbera which was absolutely wonderful but had a meager sized pour. The soup was very tasty and had some crunch to it from an actual toasted butternut garnish making it unique. I asked for salt and pepper but it never came. The portion size was enough to get the tastebuds teased but not enough to call a meal. When the soup was cleared, the octopus was served. I was asked by an entirely different bartender if I wanted another glass of wine and when I commented that my first pour wasn't even a full glass, he chuckled and walked away! Wow... is it common to insult the patrons here? <br><br>4) My first bite into the octopus dish was overly garlicky and it did not mention anything about garlic on the menu. I have an allergy to garlic and my throat was starting to itch! At this point both my water and wine were gone and I had to flag down a busser to get more water. A third bartender noticed I was sending smoke signals and came over. I told him I was having a reaction so he cleared the octopus, handed me the food menu, and asked if I wanted anything else. Kudos to this guy!!! I guess he alerted the guy who initially took my order who seemed annoyed and said it was the first time anyone sent that dish back! I told him I needed milk or tea to help my throat which he got right away. <br><br>5) I decided it was best to ask for my check. All three items were on the tab. I wasn't expecting anything for free, but typically restaurants don't charge when you let the waitstaff know you were not satisfied with it. I will concede and say that after I gave my credit card, the final tab only showed two items so it was very likely an oversight that he caught when closing my tab. HOWEVER... he also informed me that he \"accidentally ran my card for another couples tab so I might see an additional $160.00 on my card which he will void out with his manager\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME??!! So my Saturday night consisted of a meager glass of wine and a bowl of soup all for the bargain price of $200.00?? I left very frustrated and asked for the General Manager's card. I already sent an email but I feel it's important for the Yelp population to see this too.

We got seated at the end of a communal table. Our waitress was so friendly, helpful, and efficient.

We ordered The Pig Platter, the salt and vinegar fried beef tendon chips, the bone marrow, the octopus, and the pork jowl. <br><br>The Pig Platter: I loved all the different meats and the pickled veggies it came with. The pickles were delicious and went so well with the meat. I loved it!<br><br>Salt and Vinegar Fried Beef Tendon Chips: It was salty, fried goodness. My boyfriend LOVED it. It was good, but I also felt like I was gaining .5 lbs with every bite.<br><br>Roasted Bone Marrow: One of my favorite dishes. It was prepared perfectly, and I loved the bread it came with. It was toasted, buttered, and too delicious. The greens that came with it was a great complement to the rich bone marrow. <br><br>Octopus: When it first came out, it looked like sausage, but damn was it good. The pesto had great flavor, I was a huge fan. The potatoes and the green beans were delicious.<br><br>Pork Jowl: Our favorite dish. The pork was tender, salty, and so good. We loved the sunny side egg on top, the runny yolk was a great sauce to the salty pork.<br><br>Some of the dishes were a little heavy on the salt, but nothing the garnishes couldn't help with. Yum. We also decided on getting dessert (even though we didn't need it, but we were on vacation...) He got the affogato and I got the caramel poached pear dessert. We are huge desserts people. He loved the affogato (I'm not a coffee person at all), the poached pear was STUNNING. It looked gorgeous and tasted delicious. I definitely did not need to eat most of it, but that didn't stop me. I love the flavor of the poached pears, and the ice cream was a delicious nice touch. <br><br>It is communal seating, but that just means you get to check out what everyone else is eating and start some friendly conversations (aka get some awesome recommendations!).

I had a party of 5 and we ordered 8 dishes, 3 cheeses and a bottle of wine. Majaority of the plates are moderate size, decent for sharing and getting your satisfaction for each palate. <br><br>We ordered:<br>1) Grilled broccoli<br>- I love broccoli to begin with so this may be a bit bias, however I think everyone should get this. It's SO GOOD! Broccoli was perfectly cooked and charred. The dressing was creamy and tangy. Don't be put off by the anchovy, you can't taste the fishiness. <br><br>2) Grilled octopus<br>- I wish there was more octopus! This was also really good. The octopus was very tender, not at all chewy. The green beans and the potatoes were cooked and held onto the sauce very well. <br><br>3) Crispy pig ears<br>- A group favorite!! Super crispy and flavorful, a little on the salty side but we didn't mind! Oh and the crispy kale was also bomb dot com. <br><br>4) Chorizo stuffed olive<br>- I'm personally not a fan of olives (sorry! been told I'm weird for this. Just doesn't suite my palate) HOWEVER don't fret! According to my counterparts it was really good but also really really salty. The olive itself is salty not because of the chorizo. Nonetheless the plate was devoured.<br><br>5) Salt Roasted beets<br>- Yummmmmm!!! I love beets! This was also a crowd favorite. The goat cheese is whipped so it's not as pungent but you definitely still taste that stinkiness. Lol<br><br>6) Milk braised Berkshire pork shoulder<br>- Honestly, could've done without this dish. Nothing special really. Pork shoulder was cooked well, it was moist and juicy but wouldn't miss it. <br><br>7) Pork steak chop (?)<br>- The salad on the side was very tangy from the vinaigrette however it complemented the pork very well because as you keep eating the chop you notice the saltiness building up. The chop was well flavored and juicy and big! <br><br>At this point we were oddly still kinda hungry so we had planned to get a pasta dish....but it was Dinner time! They switched us over to the dinner menu and it was a little upsetting since there wasn't as many pasta  dish choices. We ended getting heirloom tomato fritters instead. <br><br>8) Heirloom tomato fritters<br>One of my favorites!! The tomatoes were so sweet and juicy and very refreshing.

As New Yorkers (and no strangers to trendy places), we were prepared to wait but were not prepared to be ignored, forgotten, then haphazardly crammed into a shared table. Long story short, no restaurant is worth feeling like a nuisance. I couldn't stomach patronizing a place that clearly cannot handle a full house and still treat people with respect. <br><br>Long story: We came around 8pm tonight (a Thursday) and the place was packed, both the inside, the bar, and the outside covered seating. We were quoted 45min - 1 hr wait time for 2 people. There's not enough seating on the long walkway leading to the restaurant to wait, so we walked to a shopping center nearby. You get a text and 10 minutes to claim your spot once a table opens up. We rushed over only to be told to wait some more and stand by the window nearby. Well...there's about a foot of space between the window and other seated guests. In that tiny space, staff and servers are running by. This meant we were constantly having to shift to accommodate staff coming through which made us feel very unwanted and uncomfortable. The entrance door is the only door to get to the patio and is right by the host stand too so it's just collision central in that area. There's really nowhere to wait or even stand to speak to the host and not be in the way. <br><br>After 20 more minutes of waiting and being completely ignored (we had waited over an hour total by now), I fought my way to the host stand and discovered we had been FORGOTTEN. We quickly got dumped in a shared table with an option to either sit side by side and stare all night at a couple across from us or sit across from each other squeezed in between the couple and a group of guy coworkers. We chose the latter, but the chairs in the communal table were crammed so tightly and the other guests were seated in such a way that we ended up being diagonal from each other rather than directly across. <br><br>By then, we couldn't justify staying. So we voted with our feet and got our farewell Chicago dinner elsewhere.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "We ordered the Crispy Pig Ears with fried egg, Octopus A La Plancha, Turkey Leg Confit, and Grilled Broccoli.

The food was incredible, though the service left a little to be desired, hence knocking off one star. <br><br>FOOD: Among 4 people, we shared the pork shoulder, pork liver and bacon pate, roasted carrots, beef with broccoli ice cream, potato chip ice cream with caviar, and bone marrow. All were pretty incredible and inventive dishes. The shoulder is a classic and I highly recommend! The pate was some of the best I've ever had, incredibly rich with a very nice bread to accompany. I also highly recommend the beef with broccoli ice cream, if you're looking to branch out - I have never had such a creative but deliciously interesting ice cream. Of the dishes we ordered, I'd say the potato chip ice cream was the only one that even came close to disappointing, and even then was worth the try. <br><br>DRINKS: I ordered one cocktail and a glass of bubbly. The cocktail was lovely - can't remember the name, but it was a gin base with cucumber flavor. Had the word green in the name, if I recall. They have a relatively small cocktail list, but an extremely extensive wine list, so may want to opt for that next time!<br><br>SERVICE AND AMBIENCE: This is the only place I'd have complaints. It's an incredibly small space and very very busy, and subsequently very VERY loud. I came on a Friday at 4:30pm with a party of 4 and still had to wait nearly an hour to be seated. I even waited 10 min just to use the bathroom, that's how packed this place was! We waited at the bar and were continually tripped over by servers and scoffed at by bar staff (to be fair we were probably in their way).

This dude had a buddy chilling there with him, no uniform, just some other dude that was stopping by to say hi. That's fine, it did not interfere with the Chefs productivity, HOWEVER, and this is a HUGE however, when the kitchen brought a topper wear of pistachios, the friend dude that was visiting, opened the container, took a handful and put his entire hand in his mouth, then took more pistachios and so forth, I was completely repulsed, now all I could think about was that those pistachios were contaminated. He didn't wash his hands prior to grabbing them by the handful, it was disgusting that the fingers that were INSIDE his mouth went right back into the container.... I obviously didn't order anything with pistachios. Everything else was pure perfection, which is why I gave it 3 stars rather than 1.

All though I liked them the most I still felt the food wasn't anything special or grand - it was more like chain restaurant quality and I really don't care for that. <br><br>We tried the duck 3 ways - again too much sauce hiding the flavors of the meat but it was also one of the better choices. <br><br>We tried octopus and ribeye. Nope- neither specialty was of my liking. Covered in sauces but not cooked in any special way. <br><br>Among other things we tried the chicharrones that had a distinct lemon flavor at the end.

Like hello, its communal eating, can we can enjoy our cocktails and food and not have you roll your eyes for having a good time. Like she totally gave out the vibe we were invasive. She totally didnt check out yelp reviews that she be sitting with total strangers. Really the service wasok too. The place was loud so could hardly hear what the brought.

Not sure if we just didnt know how to order but everything that we got was mediocre. The only thing that was good was the bone marrow spread and pork belly. The only great thing was the indianapolis family next to us.

Only good thing about dining here is you never know who you meet and the conversations you might strike up. i dont think I will be back though. Totally overrated, food not all that great and the fact Moscow mule didnt come in a Moscow mule cup was disappointing.

The flavors are outstanding, and broccoli is tender. I just love this. 5/5<br><br>Calamari - this is pretty good. I love the fregola (this dish actually got me into cooking with Israeli couscous) They dress it with something lemony, and honestly, I'm very partial to lemon so this dish was a win. The actual calamari is very well prepared, and very tender. 4/5<br><br>FRIED ITEMS:<br>Pigs ear - this is soo good. I'm used to carnita-style pig ears, which are chewy and yummy, but these are very krispy. They could've been anything fried, honestly. This dish is still flavorful, though, and enjoyable when eating. 4/5<br><br>SMEARS:<br>Roasted bone marrow - this is my favorite, and the reason why I keep coming back. The bread, the herb mix, the salt, the buttery bone marrow.. mmm. 5/5<br><br>A La Plancha:<br>Octopus - the octopus itself is tender and juicy, as well as the potatoes. But they give more potatoes than octopus so it leaves something to be desired. It's still good, though. 3.5/5<br><br>OTHER:<br>We've had this meatball type dish before with brioche. I don't see it online, or maybe I overlooked it. This was very mediocre. The menu stated the dish came with brioche. So my boyfriend and I were thinking at least one slice, right? Wrong. It was the tiniest disk in the world. What a rip off and huge disappointment that was. 2/5<br><br>They've also had their play on ITALIAN BEEF. Now, come on, we're in Chicago. How cool is that? I was very hesitant about it, not gonna lie. Both my boyfriend and brother wanted it, though, so I went along. It was so freaking good! Too bad it was limited. They served some of the juiciest, most tender, most flavor-impactful beef I have ever had. 5/5<br><br>DESSERT:<br>Lemon Panna Cotta - pretty good bc I love lemon. Sometimes the texture is off. I love the crunch from the pistachios, though. 3.5/5<br><br>Sicilian Iris - my boyfriend adores this dessert. I'm not the biggest chocolate fan, but he is and we both love brioche. This is good for maybe 4 bites and then it becomes too much for me. I think he'd give it five stars, though. 4/5<br><br>Greek Donuts - I don't know what they're called and I don't see them online. They're really yummy, and dripping with honey and cinnamon. I really love these fluffy balls. 5/5<br><br>I know my sections/titles don't match the menu in the place.

MUST TRY! $14<br><br>Beef Tenderloin & Beef Cheek Pie with Horseradish & Broccoli Ice Cream - the meat was super tender and melted in your mouth. The horseradish was like a mousse. The broccoli ice cream was different too but both went well with the dish. This was our least favorite dish but we still liked it a lot, we just didn't feel that WOW factor. $20<br><br>House Cured Sardines on Toast with Avocado Green Goddess, Salsa Verde & Fennel - this was a really great dish. It wasn't too fishy and had the right balance between toppings, toast & sardine. All the ingredients went very well together. $12<br><br>Last but not least..<br><br>Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes & Puffed Farro - hands down our favorite dish of the night. Another MUST TRY! The meat was so tender and it just fell off and onto the fork, ready to be eaten! I enjoyed the contrast in texture of the farro and the pork shoulder. Again, everything went so well together. The mashed potatoes were more like a puree but it was good. $19<br><br>Overall, this place is packing with flavor and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!

I don't know if that will always work but it worked for us during Lollapalooza weekend when the city was bustling! <br><br>For Purple Pig we put our names in around 5:30pm and was sat around 6:00pm.

For us we noticed that the cold dishes came out together first and then the warm dishes came out together. <br><br>The must-haves based on past reviews and most recommended, and I would second those recommendations are the: <br>1. Grilled Octopus: Lots of good flavor combos and liked that the texture was not rubbery  like other octopus. Really yummy! <br>2. Bone Marrow: Tip: scope all the way down to the bone! We didn't realize until halfway eating off the top layer that there was a bottom layer of bone marrow. I'm so used to other restaurants being stingy with the marrow but the purple pig gives you a good amount of marrow! Marrow melts in your mouth and loved the sea salt and green toppings it comes with. <br><br>Other plates we ordered, loved, and would order again: <br>1. Sardines: I am not a huge fan of sardines but my husband loves them so thought we would give it a try. For someone who is normally not a big fan it was delicious! Not too fishy and the pesto sauce and toast are perfectly paired. Loved it! Could of eaten more. <br>2. Carbonara: What I loved most is the al dente texture of the noodles! I wonder if the noodles were made in house. Light creaminess and bacon made for a heavenly pasta dish. <br><br>Every plate was delicious! I left happy and satisfied. Worth the wait and cost.

We were already on the Mag Mile, so I wanted to choose a place that was within walking distance. The Purple Pig is located near the south end of the Mag Mile, a few blocks north of the river.<br><br>This is a modern, happening tapas (small plates) restaurant with a bar, covered patio, and open kitchen. The restaurant isn't huge, but it's not tiny either. It's popular - at the time of writing this review, it's already got 4,581 reviews (!) - and it was packed during our Sunday afternoon visit around 1pm. They *do not* take reservations. It's first come, first served. We were lucky and were seated immediately at one of the communal high-tops near the kitchen.<br><br>As with any tapas restaurant, the dishes here are best shared. I asked our server, Andi, to give us her recommendations and she starred all the popular and most suggested items on the menu. This list should give you a good idea of the restaurant's offerings as well as pricing:<br><br>Antipasti:<br>* Broccoli with roasted garlic, toasted breadcrumbs, and anchovy vinaigrette ($8)<br>* Calamari with fregola, radishes, cucumbers, & pistachios ($10)<br>* Charred cauliflower with toasted breadcrumbs, cornichons, and parsley ($9)<br>* Salt-roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio vinaigrette ($9)<br><br>Smears:<br>* Roasted bone marrow with herb salad and Sicilian sea salt ($14)<br><br>Fried Items:<br>* Pig's ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers, and fried egg ($10)<br><br>A La Plancha, Etc.<br>* Octopus with green beans, fingerling potatoes, and salsa verde ($16)<br>* Turkey leg confit with crispy lentils, napa cabbage, and agrodolce ($17)<br>* Pork blade steak with 'nduja and honey ($17)<br>* Squid stuffed with prosciutto and breadcrumbs, Santorini fava puree, and charmoula ($15)<br>* Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes ($13)<br><br>From the above recommendations, we ended up going with the broccoli, calamari, pig's ear, and octopus. In addition, we also ordered:<br><br>* Chicken thigh kebabs with fried smashed potatoes and tzatziki ($14)<br><br>In general, the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't memorable either. I can't say I had a favorite. All of the ingredients seemed fresh and flavorful enough (for the most part).<br><br>The anchovy vinaigrette made the broccoli a bit salty.<br><br>The calamari wasn't as my friends expected (fried calamari). Instead, the calamari was more like a cold pasta dish with lots of fregola (small pasta balls, similar to couscous) and thin, tart, vinegary radish and cucumber slices. Out of the dishes we ordered, we left the most of this one behind.<br><br>The strips of pig's ear were hard and crispy (kind of like chips). I think our table was in agreement that the ear strips were kinda bland. The fried egg on top was a nice touch though.<br><br>There really wasn't enough octopus to go around in the octopus dish. What little there was was good, however. Thick and flavorful.<br><br>If I had to pick a favorite, it'd be the chicken thigh kebabs. The tender chicken and filling potatoes were simple, tasty, and comforting.<br><br>Andi did an excellent job taking care of us. Dishes came out from the kitchen as they were ready, instead of all out at once (Andi asked us what we preferred and we chose the former). A Purple Pig branded glass bottle of water was left at our table so we didn't need to wait for refills on water.

We expected a long wait and were told over the phone that the wait could be 2-4 hours during the dinner hour so we decided to come at around 10pm to avoid the wait. We still had to wait for a table but we were given the option of ordering from the full menu and eating at the outside patio if we wanted. We decided to stand around a table outside and order from the menu (no seats but we didn't mind standing and eating since the table was tall). Eventually, by the time we figured out what to get, we did end up getting seated inside. <br><br>Amongst my four friends, we ordered the Tom & Jerry steak, the turkey leg confit, and the pork shoulder. We later realized that it was a lot of meat for a late night meal. Everything was really good but because we chose all meat dishes, it did get a bit salty without some vegetables to balance it out. <br><br>TOM & JERRY STEAK (Meant for at least 2 people)<br>This was the most expensive item we ordered but because it was meant for at least two people, it's actually on par with the other individual entrees. There is bone marrow in the center that our server said you can spoon out and put on top of your meat like \"butter\". Steak overall was very good especially with the sauce. <br><br>TURKEY LEG CONFIT WITH CRISPY LENTILS, NAPA CABBAGE, & AGRODOLCE <br>I never thought I would like lentils but it gave a nice crunch and I found this dish balanced well when paired with the cabbage. The meat was tender and it came apart off the leg very easily. Since the turkey leg is so huge, I think you can easily share this dish with a friend. <br><br>MILK BRAISED PORK SHOULDER WITH MASHED POTATOES<br>The pork shoulder was also quite tender but I think I enjoyed the mashed potatoes and gravy more as the gravy was delicious. I had the highest expectations for this dish since it seemed to be the most mentioned in the reviews but it actually fell short of my expectations. <br><br>If you like pork and meat, then this restaurant is the place for you. Everything we tried was delicious and flavorful but it does verge on being too salty at certain bites. I wouldn't wait two hours for here but I would come back again at around the same time at night when the wait is way shorter and it is less crowded. I imagine that the wait is this long probably because people are spending a whole hour to finish up their bottle of wine.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3uCYmTXP58QOr5BvYb9B6Q/348s.jpg", "caption": "Turkey leg confit"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2lGCkGzdHkwdpW6h61h37A/168s.jpg", "caption": "Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ouBFGeDNTZnxrVz_zRHuYw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Tom and Jerry steak"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "My friends and I loved the different tapas offered and the loud fun atmosphere.

I saw the restaurant expediter send one order of bone marrow back twice because it didn't meet his standard for presentation and he carefully checked to make sure grilled bread was at the perfect temp and soft-cooked eggs the right level of doneness. 5 star staff for sure!<br><br>Drinks: The aforementioned amazing server handed me an enormous drink menu while they were bussing my table so I was able to get a drink in hand ASAP. I started off with the \"espanola\" ($13) a fabulous spritz style cocktail that paired well with food. Round two was the \"Two Six\" ($13) gin and citrus drink. Though refreshing, it wasn't the best choice for a dinner drink. Good for a pre-dinner next time.<br><br>Food: OMG, these are the places that make me wish for a dining companion because there were SO many crave-worthy dishes coming out of the kitchen. I started with the cauliflower dish ($9)- generous serving, perfectly grilled and tossed with cornichons, parley, and just the right amount of salt and lemon. Perfect textures, brilliant flavors, this dish was genius! For round two, I took my new bff server's suggestion and ordered the octopus ($17). I can see why this is a staff fave. The octo tentacles were huge, tender, flavorful. It came with charred green beans and tiny potatoes.

I HIGHLY recommend the first two for a great representation of what Purple Pig has to offer. The pork neck gravy tasted like pulled pork and was so rich and creamy with a great tomato base. The pork blade steak was to die for - the glaze on the pork was some rendition of nutty honey and was paired so well with a nduja.

On the bright side though, there are a lot more options instead of just the usual greezy joints. <br><br>After doing a quick Yelp search, it looked like Purple Pig was closing in 33 minutes. We figured they wouldn't be seating people anymore, but F it, it was worth a shot. To our surprise, we walked right in and got a table. Quite a difference from the 2 hour wait we're used to seeing here. <br><br>Food: The service was a bit rushed, but understandably so since they were literally closing in 25 minutes haha. My goal was to not order anything that we already ordered the last time we were here, which was difficult since we damn near ordered the entire menu last time. Under pressure, we just shot from the hip and ordered some random items, which turned out to be great.<br><br>Duck neck rillette - Last time we were here we ordered the turkey rillette, which was one of our favorite items. I'd say the duck rillette turned out to be just as good. I still don't know what the hell a rillette is, but picture a meat spread which a texture halfway between pate and shredded meat. It was salty and very dense, just delicious. When you spread it on the toast it cuts some of the saltiness and is just a great appetizer. Throw a little strawberry mostarda on there too to add a little jam-like sweetness. I'm getting whatever neck rillette they have on the menu from now on. <br><br>Smoked tongue - We were frantically looking through the menu to find something else to get, and our waiter suggested we try the tongue. Good call. The smoked tongue was delicious and a must try if you're a fan of salty meats. It reminded me of an Italian deli meat with a smokey twist. Each bite almost tasted like a cross between pepperoni and bacon. 2 for 2 so far with the dishes.<br><br>Pork blade steak - When they brought this dish out, we were surprised at how big it was. This is probably the best value item on the menu. It looked like a super juicy pork chop served with a caesar style arugula salad. The steak was as good as it gets, hands down my favorite dish of the night. It was super juicy and tender, and something about the flavor just reminded me of breakfast. It had a distinct pepper taste, and almost tasted like breakfast sausage in steak form. Highly recommend this.<br><br>Lamb ribs - This was the least favorite of the dishes. Maybe I just prefer pork over lamb. The texture was definitely there. The meat was falling off the bone and had a nice layer of fattiness. The sauce was just a little too sweet and overpowering for me. It was like a really bold barbecue sauce slathered all over the ribs. <br><br>Overall, this was as gourmet as you can get for some late night grub. I'm glad we impulsively ordered without reading any descriptions because we discovered a couple gems on the menu.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/R9e8PATbBEs0VC-1BJk8Dw/348s.jpg", "caption": "Duck neck rillette"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9C4odksVZpjz9Ks3h1Hp7g/168s.jpg", "caption": "Smoked tongue"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/41L21HXYhow7dL8m1y5-tw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Pork blade steak"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "One of my favorite places in Chicago. <br><br>Best time to go is 1-3 pm mid week.

The sherry Membrillo is a guava reduction and was tangy/sweet, a great compliment to the pork. The bone marrow custard came served in a bone cavity.

The scooped out marrow goes on top of a toasted brioche slice and add some greens to put a hint of bite. Wonderful. <br><br>Pork Blade Steak with 'nduja & honey - tender and juicy. More on the sweet side than the savory. The orange mush that comes with it is a sausage based smear. So interesting. <br><br>Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with mashed potatoes - this dish looks small but there's so much flavor and a lot of meat. Very dense.

The presentation was very cute. <br><br>Squid Stuffed with Prosciutto & bread crumbs, Santorini Fava Puree & Charmoula - the BF loved this but I probably wouldn't order it again.

The sorbet mixed with the pudding-like delight is a great way to end the meal. <br><br>The drip coffee they have is also very good so if you'd like a drink with the sweet, definitely grab a cup.

Mile area.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I'm pretty sure I experienced The Purple Pig entirely all wrong and I still loved absolutely every moment of it.<br><br>You see, this popular Chicago spot was, without a doubt, one of the most lively restaurants I've ever been to, with packed communal seating, a copious amount of shared plates, an endless wine list, and an ever-present drone of spirited conversation. My approach? I was alone, sat at the bar, drank beer, ordered only two dishes, and spoke only with my waitress. Like I said, entirely all wrong.<br><br>So, given my circumstances, why did this place feel so damn right?<br><br>First, I credit the open-air kitchen. The Purple Pig doesn't take reservations, so when I arrived to an overflowing scene, I figured it was a long shot. The hostess offered me an empty seat at a communal table, but even as someone who doesn't mind dining alone, I declined that out of fear of being some weirdo intruder alongside a large party of old friends. I then tried my luck at the back bar and was able to score a solo spot. Little did I know that this was front row to one of the most exciting, fast-paced kitchens I've ever seen. Watching the line cooks shout and prep and plate and joke, all in some unison form of communication was symphonic and aggressive and mesmerizing. I was enthralled by this uncanny form of theater, and would recommend you go enjoy the show if you happen to randomly find an opening back there like myself.<br><br>Second, I credit the food. After a quick bit of research and consulting my waitress, I ordered the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder, as it seemed to be the most popular dish at the restaurant. Yes, the name at first gave me \"Always Sunny\" Milk Steak vibes, and yes, the plate itself looks like a fatty lump covered in gooey mush, but let me tell you, this is absolute pig heaven. Sitting on a pillow of mashed potatoes, drenched in gravy, and garnished with puffed farro, the pork is so tender, the side of your fork cuts through this like a blade. This is rave-worthy, mouth-watering stuff.<br><br>This dish alone was probably enough for one person. But I sat there, marveling at the organized chaos behind the bar, immersed in the scene, thinking to myself, \"Am I really only going to order one thing? Am I really going to just up and leave right now?\" So I went for the Octopus, which arrived chopped and stacked in a pyramid of green beans, fingerling potatoes, and salsa verde. Our eight-legged friend is a pretty regular order for me in Mediterranean restaurants, but the treatment here at The Purple Pig was not your typical charred-tentacle-on-a-plate creation, but rather a tossing of said ingredients in a flavorful, land-meets-sea medley of sorts. Not to mention, I was able to shovel all of it down despite being full from the pork in the first place. I paired both with an easy-drinking Off Color Apex Predator saison (OK, maybe two), because... when in Chicago, ya know?<br><br>Now, I would typically never take to the interwebs after sampling such a small percentage of a restaurant's menu, but the fact that these two dishes were so damn delicious gives me the rare vote of confidence that the rest of The Purple Pig's plates can only follow suit. If there's anyone willing to test the limits of this menu and prove out this theory with me, I'm game. Otherwise, I'll be in the back, at the bar, by myself, watching those cooks make magic happen in the kitchen.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Oh my my!

My friend and I managed to get in after a 30 minute wait, which really wasn't too bad. The restaurant was extremely crowded and inside, people were struggling to get around each other. We were seated outside which was nice since the weather was decent.<br><br>We ordered the smoked pig tongue, bone marrow, and fried pig ears. To my surprise, there were only three pieces of pig tongue in the entire dish ($10). The flavor was extremely smoky and the texture was similar to that of jerky. This dish was a bit salty for my taste and left me gulping down my glass of water. If you are thinking about ordering the pig tongue, keep in mind that the portion is extremely small.<br><br>The bone marrow dish is probably the most ordered dish at The Purple Pig. I enjoyed it the first time I came here but after ordering and eating it for the second time, I decided that the dish was a bit too oily for me. Honestly, I'm not quite sure what the bone marrow tastes like because I am unable to taste it. The only thing that the bone marrow added was more oil to the already oiled bread served with the dish. The salad had a certain sourness to it that was somewhat refreshing and cut through all of the other heavy, oiled flavors. Even though the bone marrow spread was extremely oily, it still tasted decently and the sea salt added a nice salty kick.<br><br>The fried pig ears were unfortunately just too much fried-ness for me to handle. I am a huge fan of pig ears but I could barely taste them in this dish since they were so heavily breaded and fried. They simply tasted like giant fried breadcrumbs. The kale was perhaps my favorite part of this dish. It was lightly salted and so it tasted very similar to the seaweed sheets I loved to snack on when I was younger. The cherry peppers had a very strong sour flavor to them that overwhelmed the dish, making it difficult to finish.<br><br>I appreciate that The Purple Pig has a large variety of dishes to choose from, but based on the ones I've tried, I can say that I am not a huge fan of this place.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/V_YBu8GuHlJ6SWTaeGF8TQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "Fried pig's ears"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7E977BVGnqRXJvd2nkVzew/168s.jpg", "caption": "Bone marrow"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yF3YCL6TFq08SsIoqDJx3Q/168s.jpg", "caption": "Smoked pig's tongue"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "We came on a Saturday right at 11am and got seated right away.

The pistachios really made the dish for me as they added nice crunches of flavor that contrasted with the sweet beets.

We were lucky enough to get seats at a long table right by the entrance, but the location did lead to some awkward and uncomfortable bumping as people entered and exited the restaurant. <br><br>As far as food, we went with the roasted bone marrow (spread), the broccoli antipasti, the clam and cuttlefish brodetto, and the milk braised pork shoulder. Each was delicious and flavorful in its own way. The bone marrow was essentially meat butter and was a tasty spread for their perfectly toasted bread. Topped with some sea salt and salad, each bite was so well balanced in flavor and texture. The brodetto was served like a black pot pie and its cool appearance drew the attention of others sharing our table.The broth was terrific (although very hot, like magma hot), especially when soaked up by the octopus ink pita bread. My favorite dish was the tender and juicy pork shoulder, which was a much bigger portion than I expected. It should come as no surprise given the restaurant's name, but they do pork really well. My friend's favorite was the broccoli, which was crispy, fresh and loaded with roasted garlic flavor, then topped with toasted bread crumbs for an extra crunch. <br><br>I know it's only February, but this might go down as one of, if not the best meals of 2017.

There was already a wait when we got there, but we put in our name and waited on the heated patio until they texted us. We were able to order a drink too. The drink menu is a full on book-impressive. I started with a gin cocktail and it was very good. We decided on wine when we were seated and our server did a good job of substituting another one when the one we selected was out of stock. We started with the salted beets and sweet potato polenta. The pistachio butter on the beets was everything and the burrata with the sweet potatoes was fantastic. These two plates paired very well together. We decided to order the fried pizza Neapolitan next. He told us it was dough, which we were like, ok, but in my mind, I still pictured a flatbread. Nope. It wad a dough ball. It had some balsamic and figs on it as well. I would have liked more figs. It was our least favorite choice we made. We ended up choosing one more dish, the pork ossobuco and that was extremely tender and the gremolata was the perfect touch on top. We devoured it. At this point, we were like, well, we might as well get dessert! So, we tried the peanut butter fluff and the banana matcha dessert. Both were good, but I'm a die hard peanut butter fan, so I have to go with that one! I loved how our server did not rush us and gave us plenty of time to enjoy our plates and wine.

Like, thank you for announcing my age to the restaurant. <br><br>When it was my bf's turn to order a drink, he wanted a pinot noir.. the waitress' response was \"No, why don't you have this instead\". Going with the flow, my bf said sure, but didn't like her recommendation so sent it back. She then brought out another red w/o consulting him about what it was going to be (and he didn't like that choice either). She also said \"you must not have a lot of red experience\"...

Next, we were served the beef tenderloin which came with something like a fancier beef patty. The star of this dish is really the beef tenderloin with the sauce around the plate. I have never had such tender beef. The milk braised pork shoulder is covered in a light coat of gravy and served on top of very light and fluffy mash potatoes. While I love the flavors of the gravy, pork and mash potatoes, there was just too much pork for two to enjoy. Regardless, the pork itself was cooked to perfection yet again and it easily fell apart in my mouth. The last dish was the lamb ribs. The ribs were covered in too much of the smoky sauce, which was too strong of a taste for my liking. Again, the lamb meat itself tasted delicious; it was cooked perfectly and slid right off the bone.

We decided on a handful of plates to try a little of everything. <br><br>First, the country bread with whipped lardo & cultured butter. It was absolutely delicious. The bread was almost griddled, and had a French toast feel to it. It was delicious. <br><br>Next, the bone marrow with a parsley & caper salad with bread. The bone marrow had GREAT flavor and the bread was delicious. <br><br>Also on the bread side (we love it can't you tell??), salt cured Greek yogurt with an apple-pistachio compote. It had almost the taste of goat cheese and the compote was sweet and tangy. <br><br>Keeping with the carb theme, homemade potato tots (\"patatas bravas\") with a Harissa sauce and some other sauce. They were tangy and delicious. <br><br>For veggies, we had the broccoli with roasted garlic, breadcrumbs, and anchovy vinaigrette. This dish was DELICIOUS. Super savory and tangy. It was my friend's favorite dish of the night. I absolutely loved it, too. <br><br>My favorite dish of the night was roast chicken thigh kebabs with roasted smashed potatoes on the most amazing tzatziki I've ever had. This was seriously so good. <br><br>They also have an incredibly extensive wine menu, so there is something for everyone. <br><br>All in all, go here.

In all fairness, The Purple Pig was neither, but I am writing this review anyway. I've lived in Chicago for 15 years now and notice that a lot of the restaurateurs here have pretty big egos. I've never eaten here because I'm not a big fan of overhyped places. And anyone I've ever talked to that really knows food says this place is way overrated. We finished some after holiday shopping at Nordstrom and decided we wanted a bite to eat, so we picked here due to the close locale. We arrived at 6:30 and were quoted 1.5 hours for a table. Fine. It's 10º outside and we didn't want to go walking to find something else. We hung outside on their heated patio and ordered drinks and appetizers, which was comfortable considering how cold it was outside. The two appetizers we ordered were a salt lick, but we were starving so we just ate and mentally confirmed that the place is overrated. After 45 minutes we were seated at a communal table and ordered 5 more dishes. 2 of them were also salt licks. I mean, to the point where 1 of them was inedible. 1 was dry, and the other 2 were good. Not great, but good. What is shocking about these salt forward dishes is I'm a salt person. I eat 4 large bags of Kettle Potato Chips each and every week. I live on salt, and I found this place uses too much salt. In order for me to call a dish salty, you have to murder it. 4 out of 7 dishes were murdered. No need to mention the dishes. If you want to patron this place, you'll figure it out.  :)<br><br>I've been eating all over the world at the world's best places since Alain Ducasse cooked for me in 1983. To sit down at a place and listen to the waiter rattle off the restaurant's spiel about how the restaurant brings out the food on there time schedule, and their are 'no courses,' you just roll your eyes and say \"okay, this better be good with that kind of ego.\"<br><br>Sure enough, it wasn't.<br><br>No thank you.

The menu here is a bit exotic and as the waitress put it the name of the game is to try as many little plates as possible until you are filled up.<br><br>I started my meal off with the calamari, fregola, radishes, cucumbers, and pistachios dish. This dish was a good start but it just didn't pack the out of this world flavor I was expecting. For my second course at my waitress's recommendation I went with the lamb ribs with harissa, treviso marmalade, Isreali couscous, and orange. Now this dish definitely had that out of this world flavor I was searching for. I quickly added it to my list of top five greatest things I've ever eaten. According to the waitress that is their most popular dish. To finish my meal I went with the squid stuffed with prosciutto and bread crumbs with santorini fava puree and charmoula. This dish was excellent and very flavorful as well and I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br><br>Service is great here. All of the dishes came out pretty fast. The setting is a bit crowded and you are in relatively close quarters to the tables adjacent to you. Its quite loud in this restaurant so expect to talk loud in order to carry on good conversation with your dining companions. <br><br>Overall this is one of my favorite restaurants I've been to. Next time I am in Chicago I will definitely be back to try more of their menu.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hXDiV0KaHp3goosCU-ph3A/348s.jpg", "caption": "The menu the night I was there...it changes periodically."}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kSlJ1K6Mg7v4cnehftyZdw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Lamb ribs with harissa, treviso marmalade, Israeli couscous, and orange...the best dish ever."}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dfmycaooTn6UDcLrtBm3Uw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Calamari with fregola, radishes, and pistachios"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "This spot is right off Michigan Ave, so naturally it brings a lot of traffic whether people are coming in on a whim or have it as a must go to spot while visiting. Since they don't take reservations, I imagine it to be busy whether you come for lunch or dinner. They take your name and number down and call you once a table is ready. This allows you to walk around the nearby shops if you don't want to wait. Our wait was estimated to be 45ish minutes, so my bf and I decided to grab a drink from the bar and wait indoors. If you're lucky, the bar area is first come first serve.<br><br>The place was packed around 2 PM, so I kind of felt like I was in the way just standing around waiting around the bar area but the workers were all friendly and accommodating. They have an extensive wine, cocktail and beer list to enjoy while you wait or with your meal. Our table was ready a little sooner than expected and luckily sat at our own table rather than the communal tables.<br><br>Based on some of the recommendations here, I ordered the bone marrow spread, crispy pig ear and pork shoulder...meats galore! The bone marrow came with bread to spread it on, herb salad to toss on top and sea salt...this was new to me but it was very flavorful.<br>Crispy pig ear- doesn't sound appetizing, but trust it is a must try! It's fried pig ear mixed with crispy kale, and some sweet peppers with a sunny side egg on top which is meant to be cracked and mixed in with everything. It was delicious and I loved the texture!<br><br>Braised pork shoulder-came with mashed potatoes and the meat was super tender. Some people say its too salty, but our order tasted just fine. This was probably our favorite of the 3<br><br>It is a little on the pricier side for only tapas, but it was great trying those 3 that seem to be some of the most popular dishes.

My friend recommended this place and the reviews were great so we had to pay a visit. Everything was we tried was outstanding and delicious. Service was also impeccable. <br><br>Chorizo Stuffed Olives: Never had fried olives before. They stuffed it with chorizo so it was a nice spice to it. The yogurt sauce underneath was pretty tasty.<br><br>Roasted Bone Marrow with herb salad & sicilian sea salt: No joke, probably the biggest bone marrow dish I have been served. It was humongous! I am not complaining but damn I was surprised. The marrow was really good. if you haven't had bone marrow in the past, give it a try. The best way to describe this dish is meat butter. The herb salad was nice and light which went nice with the rich and fatty marrow. Add some sea salt for additional flavor and texture. The toasted bread was nice as well. <br><br>Pig's Ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers & fried egg: My GF and I loved this dish. I could eat those pig ears every day for the rest of my life! The crispy kale was also very good. The pickled cherry peppers give it a nice acidic and spicy kick and that amazing egg yolk just coated everything to make the dish rich, creamy, flavorful, spicy, crispy and acidic. SO GOOD.<br><br>Octopus with green beans, fingerling potatoes & salsa verde: The most tender octopus I've had. Seriously!!! Now I keep like I've been ripped off at other restaurants when they claimed their octopus was tender. The salsa verde was a bit oily but it went well with the green beans and potatoes.<br><br>Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with mashed potatoes: Super tender pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. Literally - it was fork tender. You can't go wrong with this dish.<br><br>Amazing meal. The only con is that they don't do reservations.

This dish hit all my personal buttons. Gravy was spot ON. Potatoes so smooth. The pork fell apart from itself with just a fork. This is a must get.<br><br>4.5/5 - Sicilian Iris - Ricotta & Chocolate Chip Filled Fried Brioche - I'm usually not a fan of super rich desserts but this one hit the spot for me. Brioche filled with chocolate and ricotta, split open and it runs out. <br><br>This is a meal where I really had fun from start to finish.

The pig ears were slightly salty. <br><br>Calamari w/ fregola, radishes, cucumbers, & pistachios (5/5)- Calamari was very delicious and fresh. <br><br>Chorizo Stuffed Olives (2/5)- The dish came with 5 fried olives. To be fair, I'm not a fan of olives. <br><br>Pig Platter (6/5)- So many meat options & everything was equally yummy. I would definitely order this!<br><br>Salt-roasted Beets w/ whipped goat cheese & pistachios (4/5)- Beets were cooked well and the goat cheese wasn't overwhelming. <br><br>Milk Braised Pork Shoulder w/ mashed potatoes (1/5)- The waitress suggested this and it was the most disappointing. The pork was moist but overly salted. <br><br>If you're with a large group, the best way to eat is to share everything because you basically get to try most of the menu.

Got some input from a friend who's local and suggested that I would like the menu here more - he was 100% correct as this was one of the best dinners I've had! <br><br>We were fortunate to have no wait on a Tuesday night around 6:45 PM for four people. Started out with some local IPAs and a Paloma for myself. The drinks are generously poured here and well-mixed. <br><br>For the four of us, we ordered the following - much to our waitress' shock. She gave us several warnings that we had a LOT of food... but rest assured that we finished every last bite because it was so good. The service here is impeccable. Honestly, no empty dish was left on our table for more than 20 seconds before someone scooped it up. Everyone, from the hostess to the wait staff to the busboy, was incredibly friendly, helpful, and attentive. The dishes were well-paced and we never felt like we were waiting too long between plates or rushing to finish. <br><br>1) Fried pig ears and kale, topped with over easy egg - I LOVE crispy pig ears and wished that these were a little more salty. However, they were freshly fried and perfectly paired with the kale chips. I also wish we had a bit more yolk from the egg - or maybe I just sucked at mixing it together. <br><br>2) Quail egg ravioli - Very unique. Not sure of another way to describe it, but worth trying if you are a fan of gourmet pastas. It usually comes with 3 pieces, but we were able to upgrade to 4 pieces for our table.<br><br>3) Pork shoulder - This was hands down my favorite dish. The meat fell apart so easily and was the most well-seasoned dish of the night. The mashed potatoes paired more like a sauce and eating this honestly made me feel like I was getting a warm hug from a loved one. That's how good it was. <br><br>4) Bone marrow - I've had bone marrow before and thought this was better. It was less greasy, but also the least flavorful dish we had. Not sure if I'm the biggest fan of marrow in general.<br><br>5) Lamb ribs - I didn't have this because I'm not a huge fan of lamb but the three guys I ate with said that this was their hands-down favorite. They raved about it for at least 5 minutes, especially how the meat fell right off the bone. <br><br>6) Patatas Bravas (aka house made tator tots) - The dish is literally 5 \"gourmet\" tator tots - however, I will say they were extremely tasty in the sauce they came in. The potatoes were super crispy and fresh/hot out of the fryer. <br><br>7) Broccoli - Tiny little serving but super flavorful and we all agreed it was the best broccoli we've ever eaten. <br><br>8) House Pig Platter - This is the (slightly) more expensive pig platter - there's another one that's $6 less and comes with fewer meats, but we said why not? While we have awful attention spans and forgot pretty much every meat immediately after it was explained to us, we had a lot of fun trying each of them out and they were surprisingly all very unique and delicious. This would be great with a bottle of wine, as it's the ultimate charcuterie plate!<br><br>9) Chicken kebab - I made the mistake of shoving this in my mouth as soon as it came out - immediate regrets as the chicken was super hot still and extremely juicy.

Purple pig isn't going anywhere and this review isn't going to affect business for them. But sometimes you have SUCH a bad experience that you actually want to take the time to write a review on your lunch break at work. <br><br>I was here last night with my best friend who lives in Chicago. I wanted to show him a hot spot, as I was visiting for the weekend (no longer live in Chicago) We also wanted to go to Lao Sze Chuan but they were closed (we were looking for a place still open around 10) and I really wish they weren't..!<br><br>We get sat just after 10pm because I remember Yelp said it closes in 48 mins when we walked in. We were greeted a little late at our table. No suggestions for my friend who has never been there. I order the pigs ears and beets as they were not doing brussels sprouts (out of season). After the plates were dropped off, one female busser kept trying to clear the plate with the beets on it just after a few bites. Also when the pigs ears and razor clams were dropped off they neglected the beets platter that was clearly finished and I put to the side so I had to kindly ask them to remove it. Shortly after the bone marrow was dropped off, I took ONE spoonful and another female busser tried clearing it! There was one razor clam left and we left all the other empty shells on the plate and as I was eating the last one, a female server took the plate out of the way. I deliberately left the shell on the bare table in place of where the plate was and no one took it off the table, yet decided to place the chicken drumsticks (our last order) on top so the plate was leaning. RIGHT after our last platter which was the leaning chicken was dropped off, our server rushed and asked if we wanted dessert. He never mentioned it was because the kitchen was closing or anything. At least mention that if that's the case instead of just rushing rushing rushing..!<br><br>We were so rushed I was turned off and had to bring it to my server's attention. I told him hey I get it you guys are closing but this isn't okay. He was honestly not that empathetic and when I brought it to his attention that I even worked there a few years back and was shocked at the quality of service we were getting, he questioned it and said he has worked here for 5 years and asked when I worked there. I had to name drop and prove I worked there. How offensive and snobby the way he asked..! (Also sorry but you know you can't keep track of everyone who has worked there with an extremely high turn-over rate) <br><br>Our server's name was Michael P. Michael didn't even offer us coffees on the house, or a percentage off, or have a manager come by to apologize. Nothing. And when we asked for a to-go container he put the leftovers on the ground next to our feet!! You don't do that!<br><br>I am personally never going back and will never recommend it to anyone ever again. The service (server and bussers) has really changed and we were absolutely appalled. Just because your food is well known and still delicious, doesn't mean your pretense is welcomed or really allowed. Be more humble and apologetic and make your guests feel welcome and offer something or at least a nice apology to make up for the numerous mistakes that happened within that 45 minute time frame.<br><br>I just finished eating at Cheesecake Factory in Beverly Hills (No, certainly nothing like Purple Pig or other great Chicago spots out here unfortunately) and they have astronomical service as always.

It was jammed packed, a 1.5 hour wait for just two people. Highly recommended by many of our friends so we endured.

The Milk Braised Pork Shoulder was AMAZING. Luscious, tender, flavorful. The mashed potatoes that accompanied it was spot on. And last but not least, the Asparagus + Egg which was light and simple. Pickled notes paired with the richness of the medium boiled egg. Very lovely. We were stuffed at this point so we didn't get to try dessert. Overall, a really fantastic experience. My only complaint would be the table we were sat at. We had to share one of the large high-top tables with I think... 6 other guests. I suppose during the heavy rush, the staff decided to attempt to utilize the space by sitting individual parties of 1, 2s, and even 3s all together at these tables, filling every seat and leaving no space in between parties. This felt very awkward and uncomfortable for me especially considering it's a tapas style restaurant. Lots of plates everywhere, invasion of personal bubbles, having to talk over another party's convos, very little elbow room to eat.

After our waitress made several recommendations (and me looking through yelp photos).  We decided on Pigs Ear with Crispy Kale, pickled cherry peppers and fried egg, Roasted Bone Marrow with Herb Salad, Octopus with Green Beans and Half Duck Confit-Greek Yogurt and Smoked Trout Roe served with Brioche bun. I know right!!! So my brain was thinking my stomach was bigger than it was but really I looked at the meals next to us and they were tapas size. My husband is a big carnivore.

I dislike sunny side up eggs but dam Purple Pig just makes it all right!!! You get this bowl, mix it all in and viola. Second course, Octopus with Green Beans and fingerling potatos. The octopus was very fresh tasting, slightly grilled and charred but oh so tender. The green beans/potatoes had a citrus dressing. Third course, Bone Marrow with Herb Salad. No words can explain how this meal marry's perfectly with each other. You spread the marrow on the bread, sprinkle a little bit of sea salt, i also put the citrus salad on it as well and chomp chomp. so yummy! So I was hitting the full line and thought we were done.

Duck is usually tough for me so I stay away. But oh man.. it helps that they smoked this thing for over 36 hours (or something). This thing was falling off the bones.

I know one does not go to a place named after an animal for vegetarian options, but based on the hype and culinary recognition the Purple Pig receives I expected something I haven't eaten before at half a dozen other Chicago restaurants.<br><br>I also have to call the restaurant out on their ridiculous burrata cannoli dish. I have never in my life felt so ripped off by a dish. I'm not a voracious eater and furthermore I am very accustomed to tiny tiny tapas, but somehow the burrata cannoli rubbed me entirely the wrong way. Truly diminutive, you'd think yourself at a Michelin starred restaurant, only to take a bite and be sorely disappointed.<br><br>Other veggie offerings included sautéed (and probably some grilled) vegetables, cheeses, and spreads. I think there was also a pasta dish that was or could be prepared vegetarian. I enjoyed the fava bean spread, but again it tasted the same as a fava bean spread from any other decent restaurant.<br><br>For the wine list and overall cost, I would have expected a sommelier. I will say I did appreciate being able to order half bottles, although I'm not sure that the wine recommended to me was really a great choice for our meal.

BTW, they have plenty of vegetarian and even vegan options too. We have a lot of good ones but TPP brings us such high quality, diverse meats and cheeses and wines along with some unique and amazingly creative and delicious \"other\" small plates in such impressive numbers that it is hard to claim there is a true rival. We have never been able to sample everything that we wanted to try and we are capable of some impressive pig-outs.<br><br>The diversity and quality is what keeps us coming back...and walking out stuffed, still feeling like there were at least 3-4 other things that we didn't have the stomach space to try. The food and drink have always, in the dozens of times that we have gone, been simply top notch. And despite the typically bustling, energetic, some might say over-crowded, environment, the staff is always friendly, efficient, and attentive.<br><br>However, there is a dark side to all of this. Aside from truly bizarre dining hours, don't ever anticipate that a trip to TPP is going to be quick. The news is out. People LOVE TPP and they show up in droves. They make a line down the sidewalk. There will always be a \"45 minute wait\" (yeah, right, they seem to always say that despite the real wait time). So, if you think you are going to get a quick snack of pig products (e.g.) before the play, show, or concert you can pretty much forget it...unless you come 2-3 (4?) hours before your show starts.<br><br>This begs the question (to which I know the answer), why oh why can't TPP take reservations. BTW, they do NOT take reservations. Failing that, maybe now that the secret is out, a bigger location is warranted? Their misleading solution to the problem is to take your name (and phone number) when you fight your way through the crowd, and then give you a call and supposedly 10 (15?) minutes to get there to claim your spot. This is misleading because you will walk up and THINK that the line does not look all that long and you'll make the mistake of thinking that you can get in before that show starts but that is because WAY too many people who have left their names and numbers take the opportunity to wander off. This is bad customer service (business, really) because it means that a huge number of table stand vacant for 10-15 minutes while people make their way back after getting the text...and, while I don't know this, I would bet that if somebody gets back in 11 (or 16...or 20) minutes, TPP probably does not add them to the end of the queue. <br><br>So, yeah, we absolutely LOVE everything about TPP except the fact that you better plan to spend an inordinate amount of time there because of its popularity and seating policies. It is very frustrating. Though, it has resulted several times in our trying new places (or going back to other staples of ours in the area) when we simply are not willing or able to invest the kind of time that TPP requires.

Amazing food and service!  <br><br>4.5 stars rounded up to 5<br><br>Beginning with this super stuffed squid with prosciutto, breadcrumbs in santorini fava puree and charmoula . It is light yet packed of flavors . The secret is the charmoula - made of garlic lemon blackpepper, onion and #=cumin. It is so exotic that I don't recall I had exact the same dish ever before tho I did have similar in Barcelona . <br><br>Just before I thought it won't get better from there came the might lamb ribs with Treviso marmalade, couscous and orange. This is my favorite of the night - the lamb is nicely charred on the outside while the meat is uber tender and juicy. Literally melting in your mouth! The secret, as I guessed it right, is sous vide - the lamb was flash seared, then sealed in air tight bag and cooked in a warm water bath over 36 hours. I was reading the same cooking technique on a food blog the other day. So glad I actually experienced it here! The marmalade is a tad too sweet to my liking but overall the fresh citrus flavor contrast well with the lamb ribs. The sweet-and-sour taste echoes to the summer theme. I will fly back to Chicago just for this dish alone.<br><br>Also would recommend the Bollito Misto which consisted of beef brisket, pork cheek, capon breast, veal tongue, oyster musshroms and walnut mustaro, salsa verde and tomato chili sauce.

The meat was slightly salty too.<br>Pork chips with nduja and honey (4/5)  -not sure what nduja is to this day, but I would say the pork chops tasted awesome. There was some sweet chunky sauce to go with the meat which tasted similar to Korean gochujang paste, but I wasn't really a fan of its stickiness.<br><br>This was an okay experience for me. The fried pig ears really killed my taste buds and made it hard for me to enjoy the dishes that came subsequently.

So prepare to wait at this busy restaurant. When I went in on a Sunday night, they said the wait was about 45 minutes. But it actually took 30 minutes. It's not so bad. You can have a cocktail as you wait. <br><br>The Purple Pig is your typical small plate restaurant. They have a ton of stuff here. The dishes all vary in size. So you don't know how to portion control. I think it would be better to come with more people to try more variety of their dishes. <br><br>With 2 people, you have to take a chance ordering a small subset of the dishes. I don't know if I chose the wrong ones, but the plates we had didn't impress us. <br><br>One of the dishes I tried was the Turkey Leg Confit. It was a very salty dish. The meat did fall off the bone easily, but it was very dry. It was so salty and dry, it was barely edible. The funny thing was the napa cabbages were the best part of the dish since it had some of the turkey flavor and wasn't as salty as the meat. <br><br>Also, our server seemed to be making things up. I asked her a question about their Assyrtiko wine since I never had it. She did say it was a more salty wine and actually told me it would pair well with the turkey leg. So based on her suggestion, I tried it. Ugh, salty wine with salty turkey leg? It was a bad pairing. It felt like she recommended it to me only because I asked about it. <br><br>I also tried the Beef Tendon Chips. I liked them. Although, they were just pork rinds. But I guess they were beef rinds? Nevertheless, they were still tasty.<br><br>Their Deviled Egg with Arugula & Capers was okay. I liked how the egg was deep fried. But we only got 1 deep-fried deviled egg. I thought we would get 2. Since if you cut an egg in half to make a deviled egg, you would get 2. Also, the Arugula & Capers overpowered the dish. I thought the star was the egg, not the arugula and capers. The ratio of egg to arugula was like 1:9. You're mostly eating the arugula and capers. <br><br>We also tried their Taramasalata or their \"Greek Caviar Smear.\" It came with their house bread, which were very buttery and heavy. I'm not sure if I enjoyed their bread since it was very heavy. The smear was nice. I loved the strong garlic-y flavor and the subtle fish flavor. <br><br>Overall, the dishes are hit or a miss. Their dishes are on the salty side. I would advise avoiding the Turkey Leg Confit. 2.5 stars.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "My favorite restaurant on the mag mile (and probably river north).  There will be a wait but it's so worth it.   If the salt roasted beets are on the menu when you go, you HAVE to order them.  They're the best beets I've ever eaten.  I also like that they offer several sizes of wine and their list is extensive.   The only downside to this place is that there are 2 restrooms for the entire restaurant (I feel so bad for the staff because they have to stand in line too) - so don't wait until you really need to go because you could be in line for awhile.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The food was absolutely amazing here.

This was also very tasty.  The meatballs were tender and flavorful. <br><br>Manchego Cheese with Membrillo - reminiscent of a fried cheese curd in a slightly sweet jam. It comes with four little pieces. <br><br>Broccoli with Roasted Garlic - served with an anchovy vinaigrette and topped with breadcrumbs. The other members of my party loved it. They inhaled it.

The group tried a taste of two and didn't finish. <br><br>Bucheron Cheese with Fig Mostarda - my friend is obsessed with goat cheese. She spotted the whipped goat cheese on the top of a neighboring party's beet dish and became insistent that we get goat cheese.  None of us like beets so we thought a good way to satisfy the cravings was to get a goat cheese option from the cheese selection. With our first server's assistance we settled on this goat cheese. It was served with home made chips and we chose the Fig Mostarda on his suggestion as well. When it arrived, they tasted it and it was not at all what she was picturing. They immediately announced that it wasn't goat cheese and must be something else. Brie, perhaps? It was not Brie and was indeed goat cheese. The server tried to find something that was closer to the goat cheese my friend was used to, but that mission failed. Our second sever (there was a shift change) was gracious about our unhappiness with the cheese, which was awesome. <br><br>So I tried the cheese and the swine, now what about the wine?  I have no idea.

A family friend raved about this place therefore we knew we had to try it and by try it I mean order like half the menu because chances are that the entire family won't be here together again to try it. <br><br>Keep in mind that many of these dishes are meant to share and meant to be eaten as an appetizer/snack while you drink cocktails and talk with friends. We had a 2 hour wait so we were much more interested in the food than drinks. Keep in mind that the wait IS LONG. What we did was write our name down then walked around the area. There's plenty of shopping anf sightseeing nearby. <br> <br>From the Antipasta Menu we ordered:<br>- Broccoli with Roasted Garlic: I honestly did not think this was worth it. It's sauteed broccoli. Nothing special and slightly salty. I'm assuming a lot of these dishes are salty so that you order a drink to go with it which is a smart tactic. <br>- Calamari with Fregola: Another dish that was lack luster. The portion was tiny and the taste wasn't spectacular. They're fond of squeezing lemon/lime into their dishes which I personally feel takes away from the dish. <br><br>From the Smears Menu we ordered:<br>- Pork Liver Pate: Out of the small plates I think this was the best - both in portion and in taste. It's a little unfortunate that there wasn't more bread that came with the pate. It was the right amount of salty and savory. <br>- Roasted Bone Marrrow: It's a dish to try if you like bone marrow but be aware that it is on the more oily side. <br><br>From the Fried Items Menu we ordered: <br>- Pig Ears: So I ordered this because everyone and their mother suggested it. It's definitely interesting. It's crunchy cartilage from the pig's ears but it's cut into tiny strips. It's essentially a french fry copy cat. Again, it's a small portion but nothing too special. <br><br>From the A la Plancha Menu we ordered:<br>- Fideo Pasta: Now I know that you think the word pasta implies a heaping portion. Boy are you wrong. It is a tiny bowl with a measly serving of seafood and pasta. <br>- Octopus with Green Beans: This was actually really good. The octupus was meaty and fresh. They also squeezed too much lemon in this one but if you don't like the fishy taste of seafood then this is for you. The lemon takes away the seafood taste but leave the delicious texture. <br>- Beef Coppa Steak: Worth! So worth! Portion was actually decent for steak. (After the pasta I just assumed everything would be miniaturized) <br>- Half Duck Confit: So so good! If you were to order one thing this is the dish you should order. The duck is so perfectly seasoned and moist. Good portion size for sharing (or by yourself if you're that hungry)<br>- Braised Pork Shoulder: This dish was very tender.

Yet, we decided that a Monday night a 6pm couldn't be THAT busy. <br><br>We were partially correct about this.

The main perpetrator of this was the Octopus, which was accompanied with green beans and potatoes and was covered in a Salsa Verde. However, rather than let the flavors of the Octopus and Salsa come through, the only flavor I got was \"salt\". We politely let the waiter know and he brought us a second dish that was MUCH better, so definite plus for customer service -- just not a fan that I had to ask for something to be taken back at a semi-upscale restaurant. <br><br>If I had friends come in town and want to eat there, I would first check the calendar and time to make sure it was not a Saturday at 7pm and would probably go back because it was pretty good food.

There was no wow factor to this dish like all the times i had bone marrow it had some type of bacon jam that made the dish over the top for example the best bone marrow i ever had was at au cheval it came with a beef cheek jam which was out of this world. I liked the addition of the salad though <br><br>Fried items: fried pig ears this was amaizing make sure u break the yolk and u mix everything together really well. The pigs ear were supper crispy not alot of cartalidge like i thought it was gonna be it was like really crispy onion rings then the fried kale was to die for i never liked kale before but it was so good tasted like brocoli and theres chilis in the bottom so the spicyness really made the dish a knockout it was a little salt though <br><br>A la plancha: turkey leg confit omg this was the best dish of the night it was so fucking good the skin was so cripsy it reminded me of carnitas. It was supper tender not dry at all or greasy. Then there was a lot of meat the flavour of the meat was to die for. Then the salad that went along with the dish was so good i never had a salad this good ever it went so well with the turkey really made the dish <br><br>Whole salt roasted pork tenderloin: this takes a while to come to the table so be warned about that if ur really hungry. This was the most tenderest pork i have ever had in my life literly i didnt need a knife at all it was cooked perfectly. The crackers on the side i didnt really like they were really dry and didnt taste that good. The two sauces the horshradish one i didnt taste any horshradish just tasted like normal creme. The pepper sauce was tart so it cut through the richness of the pork. The dish was good but i wouldnt order again wasnt great<br><br>Desserts: nutella crepe the banana ice cream that came with this dish was so delicous was not overturned perfect texture not to sweet either.

Walked in on a busy Saturday night around 6:30pm and was told it would be a 3 hour wait. Not too bad, considering we had eaten a late lunch, and had the magnificent mile to walk around and build up our appetite. Once seated, we obviously eyed all the plates surrounding us to help decide what we should get! We started with the calamari, which our server graciously recommended (first of 3 recommendations) and let me tell you it was delicious! Great portion for the 4 of us. Loved the watermelon radish, and the overall freshness of the dish. On to the chicken thighs, which I think were my personal favorite! Very moist pieces of chicken, which the dark meat tends to be. Paired really well with the tzatziki sauce and crispy potatoes. Again, big enough portion for 4. On to the pork shoulder served over mashed potatoes (2nd recommendation). The meat was tender enough to be pulled apart with just a fork. The marriage of flavors here was on point! Definitely a must get dish. We ordered the quail and waffle which came with two pieces of grilled quail and two pieces of fried quail. Both were equally delicious. The waffle itself was very good, but what brough the dish down was the sauce. There were way too many flavor profiles going on in this dish that we wouldnt order it again. A simple gravy would take this dish to the next level, but as is, I'd skip ordering. The lamb ribs (3rd recommendation) were AMAZING! Had us licking our fingers for sure. This was the crowd favorite, and I'd wish I had order a side for myself. I was the only one in the group to order a dessert, affogato with vanilla bean gelato, and it was perfect. <br><br>Purple Pig is a must visit while in Chicago, and I will for sure be back.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YpektZZDbA7ErTg8XDNsEA/348s.jpg", "caption": "Affogato with Vanilla Bean Gelato"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Nj-eF-HxlY53oTDnrwwEOw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Lamb Ribs (MUST TRY)"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3BJzKywArvChQhch_CZpdw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Pork Shoulder"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Whenever I'm in Chicago, I always make sure I eat here at least once.

The octopus was also quite good. The tentacles were as large as sausage links, tender and juicy. It was a tad salty however, just as the remaining dishes would be. The pork shoulder was as tender as I expected but overly salty, esp. with the gravy. We couldn't finish it. Same with the seafood saganaki, which was also nothing special. I found myself needing to down a glass of tap to counter the saltiness. Ah well.<br><br>Decent meal.  The bone marrow was definitely the highlight. Was it an off night?

We were kindly greeted by our attentive waiter and he gave us remarkable suggestions about what dishes to order. As a result, we ordered the milk braised pork shoulder and the fried pig ear. The milk braised pork shoulder was heavenly and literally melted in your mouth because the meat was extremely tender and soft. This dish was such a good value too because the portion size was large enough to split between two people and it came with a good amount of creamy mashed potatoes. If you come to Purple Pig you have to order the pork shoulder, it's definitely one of the best dishes that they have! Unfortunately, the fried pig ear with crispy kale was a bit underwhelming. The small fried strips of pig ear did not really taste flavorful and it seemed as though you were just eating fried bits of dough. However, the dish did come with a perfectly cooked fried egg and the kale was flavorful and crunchy. Overall, the fried pig ear could use some improvement in perfecting the flavor of the pig ear, but this dish is definitely a good value.

My party literally sat at our table, already cleared and ready for the next guest, for half an hour after finishing our meal. I kindly asked him grab my bill, again, because my table was in a rush to get somewhere else, but he DGAF. (Chatting with other tables =/= server-customer talk, but casual chats about their jobs, sports, life... It was infuriating to hear it all). <br><br>The Baseline: some tapas were okay, but the portions made it tricky to share. The service, an integral part of the experience, had completely ruined my experience at the Purple Pig.

The Purple Pig was one of the go-to placed she recommended and stood by. So today, my friend and I finally went to The Purple Pig to see what the hype was about.<br><br>We went earlier today (Thursday evening) around 7:20pm and was told by the hostess the wait time is 30-45 min. Around 8:10pm, another host named Miguel, who was very friendly, called me and said our table is ready soon. Then he called again said it was ready. We were seated at the long table by the main entrance with other customers. It was hard to get to our seats.<br><br>The waitress (\"Josephine\" according to our check/bill) came by and said that she'll come back again when we were settled. I asked her for water. It was hard to ask her because of the distance and it was like talking to a wall. She looked distraught and unhappy, and would look elsewhere a few times. Ok I get it, it's busy but that was our time to get informed about the menu, etc. The vibe we both got from her was, \"Ok, order already so I can get back to better things.\" It took her a while to come back and when she did, we ordered a bottle of white wine. She tried to upsell another bottle, which is fine, but we stuck to what we wanted to order.<br><br>Before leaving, she quickly recommend some of the famous dishes. Later, a tall gentleman in red plaid shirt came by with the bottle of wine. He dropped the wine opener, picked it up from the floor, and proceeded with opening the wine. I thought his wine service was crappy. He seemed indifferent and wasn't friendly at all. Maybe he had a long day.<br><br>It took a while again for the waitress to come back. I understand maybe she's busy but at least say something like I'll be right with you. We ended up ordering the Cauliflower, Pork Ears, and Pork Shoulders. My friend and I sipped on the wine and chatted while waiting for our food. In the meantime, other people were getting sat at the same long table and the same waitress seemed friendlier to them. Maybe they look \"richer\" or more \"high class,\" but not sure why.<br><br>A food runner delivered the pork shoulder first. He couldn't reach us because of the table so we helped and grabbed the dish from him. The meat was really tender but too salty in my opinion. Then came the cauliflower, which was good, and then the fried pork ears, pretty good as well. It was crunchy and the kale complimented the pig ears very well.<br><br>While eating, I noticed that the waitress and the bussers automatically refilled/poured the other customers' wine and water glasses at the same table several times. They never once came by to us to do the same, which was fine, I ended up pouring the bottle myself as well as the water glasses, but it started to feel a bit like discrimination. I even refilled the customers' water glasses who were in front of us because even the service for them was starting to slack.<br><br>At one point, one of the bussers automatically took away the cauliflower bowl, but we weren't finished with it yet. He was about to take the pig ears bowl too but I told him not yet just in time. It felt like they were in such a hurry to turn tables so that they can kick people out to make more money. The whole vibe from dining at this restaurant was just bad.<br><br>The waitress rarely came by to us and when she did, I had already refilled our wine and water glasses myself. My friend and I ended up chatting with two customers sitting directly in front of us. For dessert, they ordered the Iris dessert, which they shared with us. It tasted like a fried ice cream with syrup that you can make yourself or get from other restaurants, it wasn't mind blowing.<br><br>At the end, we were given \"complimentary\" gummy pigs lemon and grape flavored.

In fact, I've tried to dine here on three separate occasions, but the wait was always much too long and inconvenient (1.5-3 hours waiting time--yikes). A friend decided to organize a group of five of us to come here for dinner the Sunday after Saint Patrick's Day parade weekend at 3 PM. There was basically no wait, which we weren't anticipating, so we didn't get there until ~3:45.

We had a total of THREE servers during our whole meal, none of which were attentive. I was annoyed that we were duped into ordering fancy San pellegrino water when our waiter asked if we wanted \"sparkling or tonic water\"? I was disappointed to see that inflated price on our bill when it arrived. We were able to order our dishes sporadically, which was great, but we didn't see our servers for huge hunks of time. <br><br>Food: We weren't famished, so my boyfriend and I ended up splitting three dishes from the appetizer menu. We started with the beets with goat cheese and pistachios. This was my favorite dish! The pistachios added the perfect flavor and crunch to the dish. I was surprised by how big the serving was because the bowl doesn't look huge. Next, we had the Greek cornbread. I was least impressed by this, although it wasn't bad. It just wasn't anything special. $6 seems like too much money for it. Next up was the cauliflower, which was great, but still cannot be compared to the Girl & the Goat cauliflower dish. There weren't very many gherkin pickles, which disappointed my boyfriend a bit. <br><br>Atmosphere: It was very cramped. The dining space is quite small and I can tell they try to accommodate as many people as possible. They have communal tables, so it's not really an intimate environment. I wouldn't choose to celebrate a special occasion here. A our communal table, there were FOUR separate groups (five of us and three pairs). There weren't any hooks for purses or coats.

It is a Wednesday around 6:30pm .. I am glad that the line is short and we only waited about 20 mins for our table. <br><br>The environment: noise level is generally pretty high as it is a place for people to chitchat and enjoy great company. Everyone seems like they are having a good time. This Place is mostly for groups of friends to enjoy a good meal together. If you want some place that is quiet I would not recommend this place. <br><br>The attire: it is generally casual but occasionally you will see some people being really dress up. <br><br>The food: <br><br>We didn't ordered that much because we had a big lunch. <br><br>But the food is pretty good. <br><br>We order the must eat all famous <br><br>1. Roasted Bone marrow with herbs <br><br>This is a dish that is simply amazing as long as you don't mind the grease and fat that you are basically eating from the bone marrow. The fat was suppose to act as butter spread to put on the bread with some herbs and salt. Though it is greasy but the herb balance it off quit well so you won't feel as greasy eating it. After all this is a must try item from the food menu. So I would suggest anyone to try it. <br><br>2. fried salt and vinegar tendon chips <br><br>This is a snack dish that would go well if you order some alcohol with it. The size of this dish is bigger than we thought. I made a mistake because I don't think I should have order an other greasy food item after the bone marrow. So I didn't like it as much. The vinegar is a little too strong for me and the dish is just a little too greasy for me after the first dish. HOwever, my friend do like it because she likes sour things. BUt after a while it is still a bit much for her. <br><br>I would say this dish is not a must try item. Try it if you are drinking alcohol and do not mind the sour taste. <br><br>3. Milk raise pork shoulders <br><br>This is the best dish that I had from the menu. The size of the dish is pretty big for a tapa size dish. The pork shoulder were cook perfect. It is super tender and juicy. I think the milk make the meat super moist. I wonder can I get there recipe to make this at home.  <br><br>If you like pork you must try this dish. I promise you that you won't regret it.<br><br>Anyway I wish I get to try some of its veggie dishes and seafood. But my stomach can't handle that much. I guess I will just have to go back and try more. <br><br>DESsert: I don have room for any. But the waiter did bring out two complementary purple pig gummy. It is sweet and a little sour.

We stopped in early (5:30) for some food before seeing Hamilton (fantastic - lived up to all the hype). It was early but quite busy.

They seated us at a huge high communal table with bar stools (with backs so they were comfortable). Not much room for wait staff to squeeze between tables so I was often bumped but it was fine. The menu is quite unusual - descriptions are rather vague and there's no way to tell portion size which made ordering tricky. The waiter was pleasant enough but light on the details when we inquired. He said items were tapas size and so we ordered a bit more; but most of the items were def larger than tapas size. But oh well, the food was delicious. We ordered a calamari dish; it was kinda like a cold salad with calamari, couscous and chopped up vegetables - very good. We had a pigs feet and pheasant dish - also delicious. We got a cheese/meat board which was wonderful (you select whatever number/kind of meat and cheese you'd like). Also got the milk braised pork shoulder over mashed potatoes - that was everyone's favorite. Also had the bbq ribs - delicious. The only dish that wasn't stellar was the fried chicken drumsticks. Wasn't bad, just not great. Any way, the place is loud and crazy busy but lots of fun and delicious. It's kinda expensive but not unreasonable ($150 for 3 of us) probably in line with Chicago prices and the quality and dinning experience were top notch.

The menu has changed just a tad each time, but to keep this review manageable, the following dishes are must-orders each time we go: The octopus a la plancha (so flavorful and tender, not chewy or rubbery at all), roasted bone marrow, and the crispy pig's ears with kale and a fried egg. Unfortunately, whenever I order these dishes elsewhere now, they end up disappointing because I compare them to the purple pig...seriously so good here, it's amazing.

The pig ears were cooked to a nice crispness. They taste like a stronger version of chicharrones. The fried kale accentuated the crispy theme, while the pickled peppers added some nice acidity and punch. The fried egg helped to create a \"sauce\" that lifted the dish to another level.

I can't tell you if our server was knowledgeable, because we never really saw her (to her credit, the place was slammed with 45 minute wait). The person who was the most help to us was the manager. He came over to tell us they ran out of the bottle of wine that we had ordered. He helped us narrow down few items, he's actually the reason I gave this a 4th star. Secondly, the dishes are meant to be enjoyed family style. I typically enjoy family style, but the portion sizes were really inconsistent and without a server guiding you, you have no way of knowing whether you're ordering the entire menu. Finally, a few of our dishes we fantastic. The salt-roasted beets with a whipped goat cheese and pistachio butter were delightful. The shrimp toast, and the chorizo stuff olives are also must haves. BUT- and I say this with a heavy heart. The burrata lobster cannoli were a complete miss. The cannoli was bland, the lobster had an odd after taster, and sadly the best thing on the plate was the tomato. The JLT was another one that missed the mark for me, it was sooo salty we couldn't finish it.

Reading some of the Yelp reviews I knew it gets crowded and there are no reservations so we head over on a rainy Sunday afternoon at 5 pm. Already starting to fill up on the inside, we were able to snag the corner of a community table in their outdoor section. The outdoors were actually very comfortable, insulated from the rain and wind with heaters..made for a nice experience. <br><br>Food: Oh man, if I could I'd have ordered at least half the menu. Instead, showing great restraint, we went with the fried pig ears, bone marrow, the chefs feature (combination of roasted meats), and the Octopus with green beans. Each dish was excellent, the fried pig ears were not chewy at all, crunchy, crispy, porky goodness. The marrow paired well with the greens and capers served with it, I ended up dipping my bread in the marrow juices to sop up that flavor! Chefs feature had a combination of meats (chicken, pork, tongue, etc) all braised so they were fork tender. My favorite I think was the Octopus, very soft and tender, expertly prepared. We finished off with the Lemon Panna Cotta and a Sicilian Iris which was a big fried donut filled with melted chocolate and mascarpone cheese. They also had great selection on beer on tap, lots of wine from all areas around the globe, and a nice selection of cocktails. <br><br>Service: Our server Kamilah was great, knowledgeable about the dishes, made wonderful recommendations, checking on us frequently. We were also visited several times by other restaurant managers who asked us how we were doing, making sure everything was to our satisfaction. Very good service! I'm bumping them up on star based on the service we received!<br><br>Atmosphere: Mostly communal tables which actually let you see what others are ordering. Even with the rain and wind, sitting outside was a pleasant experience. <br><br>Value: A bit on the pricey side, especially if you decide to try the beers, wines, and cocktails like we did! The dishes are tapas style so not huge portions but good to share and sample several. Based on the level of service, the chef's skill, and the quality of ingredients I thought the prices were right in line with what you will receive. <br><br>Overall: For the adventurous eater this place is great and allows the diner to try many different flavor combinations. Paired with an extensive wine list, some great beers, craft cocktails, I'd definitely recommend The Purple Pig.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/y4e2D0xYbT4XQ_KCdTBvOg/348s.jpg", "caption": "Sicilian Iris..look at all that oozing, melting, goodness in the middle"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MshqkigpSaIbKcnO2maPHA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Tender octopus with green beans and fingerlings potato"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/A_pYVfN4MHwICOsnLsb8MA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Chef Selection, a combination of braised meats."}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Went on a Monday at 2 pm.

Here's the setting; Thursday at about 4:00pm, two of us...both first-timers, early February.<br>My friend and I decided to try dishes that were new to us, which was happily easy to do here. We started with these two...<br> - Salt-roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio vinaigrette<br> - Roasted bone marrow with herb salad & Sicilian sea salt Smear<br><br>Ok, so beet & goat cheese salad is not new to me, but it was new to my friend. I loved it from the first bite. No real surprises, but the whipped goat cheese set it apart, and the vinaigrette was a perfect match. My friend had not eaten beets before, thought it was ok at first, and liked it more and more with each bite. <br>Two thumbs up <br><br>Roasted bone marrow was new to both of us. This comes with about 6 pieces of dry toast to spread the bone marrow on. My friend loved it from the first bite. I thought it was good, but didn't see what the big deal was. By the third piece, however, I saw the light. This tasted to me like rich beefy tasting buttered toast. And got better with each bite. I definitely liked it better with the sea salt sprinkled on top. The salad was a lemony parsley. Very nice, but when I put it on the crostini it overpowered the taste of the marrow, so I ate it afterward. Again, two thumbs up <br><br>Next came two fried items from the \"Fried Items\" section of the menu...<br> - Chorizo stuffed olives<br> - Pig's ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers & fried egg<br><br>Chorizo stuffed olives - This one fell a little short for me, and fell to the floor for my friend. I expected large olives, since they would be stuffed, but they were quite small. I could barely taste the chorizo. I cut one open and tried it on its own and it was quite mild. I would have been fine with it as simply fried olives. It had a crispy crust on the outside that was nice, and sat in a puddle of sour cream (I think) that was nice with it. But again, not nearly enough chorizo flavor. As for my friend, she made this face , pushed it away, tried it again with the same resulting face, and left it alone. Just too strong of a green olive flavor for her.  Opposing thumbs  on this one.<br><br>The pig's ear dish was probably the highlight of our evening. Crispy fried strips of the pig ear with the crispy kale and peppers underneath a fried egg. When they bring it to your table, they tell you to mix the egg in and stir it all up. So we mixed, and we stirred, and the result was delicious. This is the kind of crazy-sounding combination that works perfectly and makes me want to keep trying new things. The peppers are sweet & sour and worked perfectly with creamy egg and crispy kale and pig's ear. The pig's ear alone is fairly mild & tasty. Two enthusiastic thumbs up <br><br>Next came dessert...<br> <br> - a chocolate cake with scoops of mint and creme fraiche sorbet and milk jam<br><br>Yummy, yummy, yummy. The only disagreement here was over the mint sorbet. I could eat about a gallon of this all by itself. My friend wasn't crazy about it. I thought it was necessary to counter the very rich cake. The milk jam was spread on the plate, looked and tasted a bit like a mild caramel. All very good. Two thumbs up <br><br>We entered shortly after 4pm and were seated immediately at a table in a mostly empty house. Within an hour, the place was packed. <br>The tab, with no alcohol, came to $54<br><br>I will return. The hardest part for me was deciding which dishes not to eat. And the biggest disappointment was that the razor clams are not on the menu this time of year. A good excuse to come back in the summer (as if I needed one).", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nqgVZHVavZWjKciUQERoJw/348s.jpg", "caption": "Chocolate cake with mint and creme fraiche sorbet and milk jam"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2zxxkgImzTrhukUqckOI8w/168s.jpg", "caption": "Pig's ear, crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers, and egg"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bKpmZmQoVzUdknLisyxUig/168s.jpg", "caption": "Chorizo stuffed olives"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "AMAZING!

The fried deviled egg was disappointing -- one egg that didn't have complex flavors for $8...  (Apparently, The Purple Pig really likes their pickled vegetables, because this dish was full of cornishes, which again ruin this dish for me. I'm fine with some pickling agent on a dish, but they over do it here.) The roasted beets and goat cheese foam was absolutely delicious, and one of my favorite dishes that we had.<br><br>For entrée, the Italian sausage was perfect. It came with this ratatouille underneath which was outstanding, and I'm normally not the type to eat tomatoes.  <br><br>I think the main reason why I give The Purple Pig 4 stars instead of 5 is because while some of the dishes were outstanding, some of them had unsuccessful components which didn't match the dish. Consistency is paramount, After all. Overall, I would definitely recommend going to The Purple Pig.

We told her what we told the hostess and she said that they typically do not seat parties that are not together, and said that if they were not seated within 10 minutes, then their seats would be given away. This is understandable, however, that was not told to us when we were first being seated. After hearing this news, we called our friends and told them to hurry back before we wouldn't be served and when they made it in time, our server completely disregarded us for a lengthy time, even though she was pressuring us before. <br><br>The discontentment in service continued when our friend was observing the wine menu and Josephine passively accused him of not being 21. In addition to this, throughout the dinner, the only time we were checked up on was when she asked us if we wanted dessert after hearing us talk about it. We sat at the communal bar table and she frequently checked up on each group sitting at the table except for ours. As people who work in the food industry ourselves, we did not appreciate the lack of customer service, especially at a high end restaurant.

We arrived about 10 minutes before they opened but there were already several people waiting in line! Thankfully, we got seated right away as soon as they opened. <br><br>We shared 3 dishes which was the perfect amount for the 2 of us:<br><br>- PORK NECK BONE GRAVY WITH RICOTTA SMEAR: yummy!! So savory, rich, and flavorful! The crostini breads had a perfect toast to them too. I found myself using that last piece of bread to sop up all the last little bits of gravy goodness. Definitely recommend getting this! It's a great appetizer for sharing!<br><br>- MILK BRAISED PORK SHOULDER WITH MASHED POTATOES: This is their signature dish, but it was actually my least fave of the 3. First of all, the presentation wasn't very pleasant... it looked like plain cafeteria food. Yes, the pork shoulder was cooked very well and was very soft, but it pretty much reminded me of the texture of kalbi jjim (and if you're Korean, that stuff is NBD and something your taste buds are just used to). It wasn't that flavorful either. The mashed potatoes were very creamy but nothing special. Overall, this dish is pretty good but not amazing.<br><br>- PIG'S EAR WITH CRISPY KALE, PICKLED CHERRY PEPPERS, & FRIED EGG: OMG this was soooo goood!! Truly has the WOW factor! This was my fave of the 3! I loved the texture of the light and crispy kale, with the crispy chewy pig's ear, and the acidity from the pickled peppers. The fried egg was like the perfect cherry on top. Although this dish is slightly on the oily, greasy side... it's still freakin amazing and you don't feel as guilty eating it because... it's kale! :P<br><br>Service was very friendly and nice but a little unorganized... they kept bringing us dishes we didn't order, that belonged to another table. <br><br>Overall, this was definitely one of my favorite meals in Chicago!

You know what they say.. always save room for a dessert! We ordered sicilian iris for closing.<br><br>Finally the time we waited has come, the waiter brought in our ordered and I fell in love already with the pork shoulder. It looks so good and amazingly it tasted better than its look. The pork was so soft and juicy while the mashed potato itself was just a perfect fit. Then the first bite of the crispy pig ear was just delicious! The crispy kale though, my fave! I never thought kale could taste as good as it is. It's definitely a must try menu! The last but not least.. the sicilian iris was a 9/10. It was a little bit too sweet for my preference, but overall it was just perfect.

No slice of cucumber or shred of lettuce was left behind. The best part about this salad were the sweet sundried tomatoes.<br><br>Hazelnut Salad: I'm unsure of the exact name, but this has thin slices of butternut squash, zucchini, hazelnuts, shaved cheese, and blueberries that have a pickled flavor. <br><br>Olive Oil-Poached Tuna: The green beans were crisp, and the tuna was delicious. <br><br>Calamari: The calamari was soft and not chewy, and I enjoyed fergula. What I didn't like about this were the sliced radishes.<br><br>Pig Platter: I can't remember all the pork products on our board, but the thin slices of tongue were my favorite. We almost ate the board clean, except for the brains. Buttery and oily, it's an acquired taste; though, I think it's palatable when spread on the thin crackers that accompany the platter. <br><br>Sicilian Iris: This dessert is essentially a fried doughnut snowed upon by powdered sugar. Sliced in half, a hot mixture of ricotta cheese and chocolate chips oozes out. Delicious and heavy.<br><br>Dessert #2: Too busy gorging, I don't recall the name of the fudgy peanut butter dessert served with two swirls of cream on either side, and topped with caramel popcorn, which I didn't care for. <br><br>Service: Exceptional.

We came to TPP for dinner, and it is a good place for dinner. In addition to appetizers, smears (various meat-based \"spreads\" served with crostini bread), cured meat and cheese selections, panini sandwiches, TPP has \"a la plancha\" or plates. <br><br>My friends and I ordered two appetizers: (1) Charred cauliflower, toasted breadcrumbs,cornichons & parsley  and (2) Squid stuffed with prosciutto & bread crumbs, santorini fava puree & charmoula. The charred cauliflower reminded me of a roasted cauliflower soup I make, so it had a familiar taste, but the cauliflower was both salty and sour: the vinegar made it sour, the generous salting made it salty. Interesting flavor profile for cauliflower. The stuffed squid had a tough texture (squid), and the prosciutto was ground and stuffed inside the squid. The appetizer serving comes with 4 pieces, which is great for a party of four or just a dinner date. <br><br>For plates, my party of four ordered 4 meats: veal, lamb, chicken, and turkey. I ordered the turkey leg, and the meat fell off the bone. So tender. Also, if the the thought of turkey leg reminded you of Disneyland, you're right. This leg was bigger than your standard chicken drumstick. In fact, another patron came over just to snap a picture of the turkey leg. A complete stranger took enough interest <br>in my food that he wanted to visually document it. Wow. <br><br>My friend's lamb blade steak was just as tender, and the chimichurri sauce was as parsley-esque as can be. If you don't like parsley, then skip this plate. The val was tougher, but unlike many veal plates Gordon Ramsay has tried on Kitchen Nightmares, this was well done. The chicken kabobs were tougher, but they were made from chicken thigh meat, which is different from standard chicken breast meat kabobs. Tzatiki sauce was on the watery-side, but a nice cool to the heat of the sauce that coated the kabobs. <br><br>The plates don't come with sides, so order a vegetarian appetizer like the cauliflower to get your meals' worth of veggies. <br><br>Overall, the food was good (Read the MEAT was as good as it gets). Don't read too much into the name: TPP has pork, lamb, turkey, chicken, and even cauliflower. I wouldn't recommend this place to a vegetarian, as a coworker erroneously did a few days back (oops!). But, if you like meat, and if you like wine or fine cocktails, come here. The ambience is very dark and dim-lit-my pictures with flash of the food look better than what my own eyes were able to capture last night. People are seated on the patio with warming heat lamps, and inside on high rise tables (seat larger parties/you'll be rubbing elbows with the party next to you) and low rise tables (seat 2-4/placed fairly close to one another).

They do take down your phone number so you can totally walk around and explore local spots or grab a drink nearby (John Hancock Tower and Magnificent Mile is nearby fyi for tourists). The hostess said it would be about 1.5 hour wait thus, the waiting commenced. This place has a huge quad area that allows you to sit, wait, and drink.

It was very citrusy and I did not really like it.<br><br>Milk Braised Pork Shoulder: this reminded me of my mom's thit kho (vietnamese dish). The meat was super soft and just melts in your mouth. Also, it was a bit on the salty end. I kept having to drink water to wash away the salty taste since there was no salad or rice to balance the saltiness.<br><br>Octopus: This was probably my favorite dish of the night and it was a blend of salty and citrusy. The octopus was perfectly chewy and I really enjoyed it.<br><br>Mussels: not salty or citrusy. It was creamy and came with two piece of toast. The meat was yummy, but it's honestly nothing special.<br><br>Service was great. Total meal came out to about $35/person.

I've never had pigs ear before, but I was definitely not hesitant to try it as I've had way crazier sounding things! The pig ears were fried well, the kale was a little salty for my taste but the mix as a whole with the pickled peppers tones the saltiness down.<br><br>We wanted to try everything but we asked for crowd favorites, we ended up with the pork braised in milk and prosciutto stuffed squid The pork was very tender and the milk/mashed potato paired amazingly.

This place delivers with each bite. <br><br>The location can be a bit tricky if you are coming in from Michigan Ave. You walk through the building then you will find the entrance to the back of the restaurant. This place was packed on a Friday afternoon. We were starvin' like Marvin' so we chose to sit outside instead of wait for a table inside. Despite the low temperatures there were several people sitting outside in the enclosed patio area and there were several heat lamps, so we felt why not. Um, boy we were wrong. It was freaking cold. Halfway through lunch my thighs froze. As someone else mentioned, the tarp had several openings. Ugh! I'm telling you if it weren't for the food and the fact that we foolishly decided to sit outside, I would have marked this place down a star, but that food made up for it all. Next time, we will just wait for a table. <br><br>Despite the cold, we had a wonderful dining experience. The staff was fantastic. Our waiter was helpful. They also came around to make sure out water glasses were never empty. Superb service! <br><br>Now, the menu. This place is all about the swine, so you will find things that might immediately make your stomach churn such as tripe, but then you have traditional items such as braised pork. I dined with two friends so we decided to share half a bottle of Shiraz and the pork neck bone gravy with ricotta. Mind was slightly blown by this dish. First, the presentation was nice and the dish itself was perfection. The meat was tender served in a tomato base along with the warm ricotta and bread. We didn't want the dish to end. <br><br>For our main course, my friend and I decided to get two different paninis to share. We split the slow roasted ham with scamorza cheese, and sundried tomatoes and the corned beef brisket. Sweet baby Jesus! Both panins were outstanding! The slow roasted ham inched forward as my favorite only because the brisket had dijonnaise which was a bit tangy, but none the less both panins made my day.

Frozen solid after walking a magnificent mile from Millennium Park to the hotel, wine, cheese and tapas sounded like the perfect antifreeze. Purple Pig hit all the marks.<br><br>First, I love the communal tables that nudge you into new, if temporary, friendship with your neighbors. We joined in a birthday celebration with a guy from South Carolina and his family, and shared must-see-Chicago tips. <br><br>Everything we ordered was absolutely first-rate. We started with roasted beets with whipped goat cheese, and I wanted to order a whole batch to ship home to Kansas City. Next was a cheese plate, ordered by my dining companion, so I have no idea what I ate. But all three were good, especially with the berry compote that came with them. My chorizo panini was delicious, and the marinated carrots in the salad were wonderful. My friend ordered pork ossobuco, and good Lord, I think there was half a pig on her plate. It nearly fell off the bone, over a puddle of polenta and gravy. She loved it. All that and a bottle of Cotes du Rhone, and we were warm and cozy for sure! And way too full for anything on the very creative dessert menu. That's for another visit.<br><br>The servers were marvelous, the perfect blend of friendly, gracious, and knowledgeable, without being overbearing. The whole feel of the place is relaxed,fun and friendly, and if your tab at the end of lunch just happens to have three digits to the left of the decimal, it's completely worth it.

The hostess asked if the communal table would be alright (I was initially apprehensive), and we took the seats. We ended up meeting some cool tourists and chatting with some other patrons, so it wasn't that bad at all.<br><br>Service was decent by our server throughout the meal. The menu is quite unique (and I'm not judging them on it even though I don't care for greasy food without some sort of balancing counterparts). We ordered a mix of items, including the famous fried pig ears with an egg, the beets appetizer, the chicken kabobs, and the steak.<br><br>Everything here was so heavy (with the exception of the chicken kabobs). The pig ears were good, but the portion was way too big and the egg made the dish even heavier. I wish they would have offered some sort of green salad to lighten the meal. Even the beets dish was heavy with a big glob of rich cheese. Again, it was good, but it was just too much for me.<br><br>The chicken thighs redeemed the earlier dishes. They were tender and moist, and the dipping sauce was tasty below. However, the fried potatoes on the side were heavy and generally tasteless.<br><br>The grilled steak was good as well-- but parts of it were pretty underdone. It came out pretty late during the meal.<br><br>Dessert was a total miss-- the waiter recommended a seasonal fruit tart that was made \"fresh to order\". The filling was decent, but the crust was rock hard.<br><br>Come here for the ambiance, but don't expect to find a balanced menu.

The supplements of cheese, berry jam, and grilled bread only help with that. <br><br>JLT ($13)-  What makes this dish is the pork jowl (pork cheeks) which is sufficiently fried, smothered with pesto and blanketed with a fried egg. It's crunchy, chewy, slightly charred and zestily finished with the aioli. SO GOOD. Also comes with diced tomato and arugula. <br><br>Milk Braised Pork Shoulder  ($13)-  Fork-tender, but the generously marbled hunk of hog affected the taste, overall.  Comforting to some, but I felt it was a bit overwhelming and something I didn't care to taste more than twice.  My party all agreed.<br><br>Chicken Thigh Kebabs ($14)-  Probably the juiciest and most flavorful chicken I've had in recent memory.  Not only does it look appealing in its plumpness, the color, presentation and even crispiness deserves applause.  The tzatziki sauce is aromatic in smell and flavor, amplifying the enjoyability of this dish.  You can choose to order fries, instead of potatoes and they give an ample amount when you do so.<br><br>Roasted Bone Marrow with Hern Salad & Sicilian Sea Salt ($13)- I'm a lover of roasted bone marrow, but didn't enjoy Purple Pig's for a couple of reasons. 1) It doesn't look appealing to eat.  The gelatinous material wasn't roasted/baked long enough so the marrow wasn't caramelized well, making it gray in color.  2) Wasn't bold and flavorful as I hoped.  In short, Bestia and Animal in LA do the best job of this dish.  <br><br>Pig's Ear  ($10)- An absolute standout of the evening. These fried salty pig ears are something I wish I could eat while watching football and drinking a sweet beer, all day!  Highly addictive, they're sliced thinly and placed on a bed of crispy kale, tangy cherry peppers, and covered with an egg.

The reason it is so good is because everything you get there is unique and cant be replicated at another restaurant. The staff is also friendly and they rave about the food.

Pork Fried Almonds (4/5). The flavor was great but the texture of the almonds were too soft. <br>2. Petit Basque Cheese with Membrillo (5/5). Tasty.  A play on flavors in your mouth. <br>3.

Pork Tripe Ala Parmigiana with Pork Skin Breadcrumbs (5/5). its a play on a BLT but the tripe is meaty and full of bacon flavor. <br>3. Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes (4/5). It was good but i like my pork shoulder smoked and falling apart. This did not have that flavor profile. <br>. Turkey Leg Confit, Crispy Lentils, Treviso, Endive, & Agrodolce (5/5). My favorite dish. Its cooked in pork fat so it tastes like pork but its a turkey leg. Every bite is a indulgent and never a dry piece of meat. I would get this every time i went.  <br><br>Dessert<br>1. Panino con Nutella (4/5) - Great but nothing memorable. People rave about anything with nutella but from what i have learned is that it is best to be eaten in all of its glory with just the jar and a spoon.

Looking at over 3300 reviews on Yelp, you know how popular this establishment is. Since they don't take reservations, a wait of an hour during meal time should be planned. Knowing that, I walked into the restaurant at 3pm and was able to sit at their communal table without any wait. The communal table is a perfect place to sit if you dine alone, as you can pretend to be part of a big family. And I was lucky enough to strike a conversation with a local couple next to me, definitely a plus to the dining experience. The ambiance and decor of the restaurant is very nice, however the music is kind of loud if that concerns you.<br><br>The Purple Pig serves Mediterranean cuisine that is designed for sharing. Since I was just by myself, the waitress Nikki recommended I could try 2 or 3 dishes. Everything on the menu looks very interesting and tempting, I really could not make up my mind. Nikki was nice enough to let me keep the menu and order just one by one. <br><br>Well, I admit that I did some homework before coming here and knew for sure which one I want to try, that is, Squid Stuffed with Prosciutto. The dish came in with three pieces of squids as you can see in the picture. Boy, that was the BEST squid I have ever tasted in any restaurant. The tenderness of the squid is perfect, so that it is not chewy as usually it is. The flavor of charmoula  sauce blends impeccably with the squid. I am not too crazy about the stuffed prosciutto as I still love prosciutto in its original form. It is the texture rather the meat that I am too keen about. But this dish definitely is a reorder, and lives up to the restaurant's reputation. <br><br>While enjoying the squid, I was checking on the menu too and my eyes settled on pig ears. This was the first time I ordered pig ears in a non-Chinese restaurant. The highlight of this dish in my opinion was the fried egg sitting on the top. Both pig ears and kale were fried to perfection with little breading. I like the fried kale even more in this dish as it was more flavorful. For some reason, I still like our own Chinese way of preparing the pig ears. The fried ones are nice to chew, however, it lost its original texture after being deep fried. Having to finish the entire bowl does not help either. <br><br>At this point, I was a bit torn whether to order the third dish or not. My mind told me to do so while my stomach was begging for a stop. After much debating and discussing with Nikki, I landed on the Charred Cauliflower. This turned out to be another spectacular dish that lands on my reorder list. The theme of this dish is crunchy. The cauliflower was grilled into a perfectly crunchy texture with vinaigrette nicely sprinkled and flavored.  So, the sourness, the crunchiness paired so well that I finished this before I realized myself. <br><br>All in all, I found the ingredients are all very interesting and the combination of spices are most intriguing.

It might be a little loud if you are here for a date because everyone is drinking around you and shouting but if you just want some fun, this is the right place to go. We got seated right away and our first server was super nice. She recommended a wine to us according to our preference, and she also recommended a lot of places for us to go with her local experiences at Chicago. Me and my friend are not from the area so it was super nice of her to suggest local bars and restaurants. She wrote it down on a piece of paper too! The second server was not as nice but she was attentive enough to come over and check on us from time to time.  <br><br>So going over to the food, we got Foie Gras torchon, cannoli with squash and pistachios, and the milk braised pork shoulder. The cannoli looks really pretty (see picture!) but the squash is slightly to acidic to our taste. The Foie Gras is great, but I wish the plating can be a little bit more well executed. Our favorite dish was the milk braised shoulder! It was really tender with a lot of great tastes to it, and the mashed potato blends really well with the meat. It gets slightly too salty after a while though. <br><br>There are a lot of other stuff on the list that I will like to try next time if i am in Chicago.

I never have once experienced this ever before at any restaurant. <br><br>My family (cousins + siblings) and I dined here last Sunday as our final meal in Chicago before we headed home. We were in Chicago to celebrate several graduates. We were with a large group and waited 40 min. or so for a table which we did not mind. We used that time to walk around the magnificent mile. <br><br>When our table was ready, the hostess escorted us to a high table in the patio area. As I was walking towards the table, one of the staff member by the front door of the main dining room greeted us with \"Welcome to America\". <br><br>Mind you, we did not make any conversation with this person. I was taken back and had to get confirmation from my brother, which he confirmed he heard, \"Welcome to America\".<br><br>Before we sat down, I addressed the unwanted greeting with the hostess; she kindly got the manager for me. When I told the manager what had happened and mentioned to him what his staff member said was \"hurtful\", the manager said he will talk to him.

The skin was crispy and rich in flavour and the meat was juicy. It came with caviar, sauce, and rolls, which could be used to make a mini duck slider. The option to make one's own sandwich was a cute touch. Or all the components could be eaten separately. The half duck is hearty and larger compared to the other plates. The lamb ribs were my favourite. It had this amazing glaze that tempered the gamey flavour that is often attributed to lamb. The meat fell right off the bone and I could have eaten two orders of that dish by myself.

The place is in the heart of the shopping district so we worried that it might be tourist-y. It was, a little, but the food was FABULOUS. Three of us shared six small plates, beginning with pork-fried almonds seasoned with garlic and rosemary. Next came the standout of the meal, octopus with fingerling potatoes. The octopus was seared crisp on the exterior (in pork fat, no doubt) and melt-in-your-mouth tender inside. Next came pig cheek on a piece of toast topped with greens, some delicious seasonings, and a soft fried egg, also highly rated by our little group. We also got a plate of duck neck (not exactly confit) with cranberry sauce and bread. The duck meat was in little shreds and the flavor didn't quite hit it for me--it was sort of a Thanksgiving in April experience. Broccoli with breadcrumbs was a nice break from meat. Fried manchego with quince was stunning. I mopped up all the quince jam with the bread that accompanied the dish. By then we were all stuffed and couldn't cram in another bite.<br><br>Damages for the six plates was a little over $70, so no complaints there. It was a cold, drippy day and the place was packed so we sat in the enclosed, heated patio, but we still got a little chilled. The Purple Pig is a little too hip for my comfort (people who read a lot of my reviews know that I love dives and neighborhood gems) but I can't fault it for that. We experienced no snootiness from our servers; instead they clearly loved what was served there and gave us good advice when we asked for it.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I love this restaurant!

I really didn't mind the standing room only because the food service was fast! I give this restaurant an overall rating of 4 stars due to the limited restroom availability. You have to stand in line for a long period of time due to it being a single stall. However, the food is 5 stars. Pig ears and Brussels sprouts are a must try! I also loved the lamb ribs!

It is not because I'm from LA, the land of great cuisine from every country, but because the food was very salty. <br>The pork shoulder tasted like meat with a lot of salt thrown on it. The egg (or was it gravy?) did not help even out the saltiness.  <br>My favorites were the bone marrow and the seafood in marinara sauce (which I currently can't seem to find on their menu). However, we did not need 3 dishes of bone marrow, which was encouraged by the waitress. Additionally, the bone marrow was like any other bone marrow dish from any restaurant that serves bone marrow. The bread that came with the bone marrow was a tad salty though. The seafood in marinara sauce was really the saving grace of the entire experience.<br>The pork ears were tasteless and crunchy. Most of our group was not a fan, but if you're used to eating pork skin and other parts of the pork, this is your dish!<br>Ordered a bunch of other dishes that were either just okay.<br>But the worst part of my experience was the fact that we had to waste 6 dishes because our waitress encouraged us to over-order. I know that people will say it's our fault for ordering so much, but when you ask a waitress what they think about our order so far and encourages you to order more, you do!  She specifically said, \"I think you should double up on this dish and that dish. Oh and this dish is SO delicious that you guys should order an extra.\" I have done a lot of fine dining and eat out a lot, so I am used to waiters and waitresses giving us an honest opinion and even stopping me and my friends from ordering extra. The usual order of business is to leave a menu just in case we end up wanting more food.  However, due to our waitress continually encouraging us to order more, especially when I kept asking if it's a lot of food, we didn't even get to touch 6 dishes. That is a HUGE waste of food and money. The waitress later tried to help us by trying to find other tables that had ordered the same dishes, but it was a little too late. <br>Overall, the food was just okay, the experience was meh, and the wait time was terrible. <br>Waiting 2.5 to 3 hours to eat here is not worth it. Either stick to a small group if you're coming here or go during a downtime. Also, only order 1/2 to 1 dish per person in your group and wait to order more later. Do NOT listen to the waitress or waiter if they keep encouraging you to order more food. They seem to only want the tip. <br>It was worth it to try and see if it was all just hype or if they actually had amazing food.

Small plates are such a fun way to go and especially when they are not run of the mill. We went on June 17th, a beautiful Saturday in Chicago. There were 4 of us. Our friends had been there before, so they knew the ropes: get there early (we were there at 11:15am for the 11:30am opening and there was already a line); be prepared for very crowded and noisy conditions and seating that is more European so you can make new friends (and see what everyone else is eating so you can decide what to try next); be adventuresome and willing to try new food. Our waiter was excellent and very helpful with choosing dishes - the variety is inventive, fresh and tasty and the perfect size for sharing. I also like that they don't bring everything out at once. The pace was very good. We tried the chorizo stuffed olives, smashed potatoes (yum), roasted broccoli (yum), calamari (not my fave - too much vinegar), hummus (ok), deviled eggs (yum), and the JLT (pork jowl, arugula and tomato - ok). Our friend tried the berry infused sangria and loved it. I loved that they had sparkling rose wine and mimosas. We really wanted to try a few more things and have dessert, but were too full. Will have to go back and do that. Even though it was packed, we never felt rushed or pushed.

Was it too much food? Yeah...but totally worth stuffing our faces. <br><br>Three-cheese selection: our server picked three cheese for us. The plate came with a jam preserve as well as some cracker / crisps. We had an aged cheddar cheese with espresso powder on the outside (forgot the name), the Grayson (a softer cheese), and the Blue Bonnet (blue goat cheese). Grayson was our favorite. I probably would not do the cheese selection again, because for $19 we could have tried something more substantial. 3 stars. <br><br>Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg: This was good, but people really hyped this one up for me, so I was somewhat disappointed. The kale and pig's ear were fried. I'm normally a huge fan of pig's ear, but having it super fried lost a lot of texture and even flavor that I usually like. Fried kale was decent, tasted like kale chips. 3 stars for the pig's ear, sorry. <br><br>\"JLT\" Pork Jowl, Tomato, Frisee & Fried Duck Egg - Probably our favorite. First bite was really good and flavorful after we broke the egg yolk and drizzled it over the open-faced sandwich. The pork jowl bacon melted in our mouths, but there was not a lot of it, though we enjoyed a few really worthwhile bites bacon. Yum! 4.5 stars. <br><br>Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs - Bone marrow had great flavor, really tasty Texas toast came with the plate. The portion at Gilt Bar was so much bigger and we each got 2 bones of our own, but there was only one bone for both of us at The Purple Pig. I am curious because from the photos on Yelp, it looks like the plate should come with two. Maybe they were running low on bone marrow last night. Nevertheless flavor was amazing, and I would recommend to anyone. 4 stars. <br><br>Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Fingerling Potatoes - Cooked to medium, had an Asian-y, miso or soy flavor to it that we could not pin point. Good overall steak, but you probably didn't go to The Purple Pig for steak. I would skip next time. 3.5 stars.<br><br>Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - I heard that this could be on the saltier side, but we enjoyed it. The sauce was really tasty, pork was braised to perfection, and the mashed potatoes were flavorful. It was quite heavy though, but if you like creamy, this could be yummy. 4 stars. <br><br>Sicilian Iris {Ricotta & Chocolate Chip Filled Fried Brioche} - We almost didn't get dessert because we were so full, but man am I glad that we did! :) This came out super hot, and when we cut it open, the ricotta and chocolate sauce just melted onto the plate. I loved loved loved it, it was super delicious. 5 stars. <br><br>Our bill came out to be $115 (including a glass of wine), so pretty reasonably priced for how much we ate. Service was also very good. 5 stars for service. <br><br>Overall, I really liked The Purple Pig, but I do have to say it's not worth an hour wait to come here. Coming before 6 pm definitely helps. The dishes were all good and I'm glad that I have tried the \"signature\" dishes, but honestly none that I would come back for specifically (other than maybe the Sicilian Iris).", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hGxQTcdf3pYCiBKmDUc04Q/348s.jpg", "caption": "Sicilian Iris {Ricotta & Chocolate Chip Filled Fried Brioche}"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AyGsEhPJPZzjLHRHUFxk8A/168s.jpg", "caption": "Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jwRfVR832kMb2W3HIyU55A/168s.jpg", "caption": "Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Fingerling Potatoes"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "WOW.

I'm so glad we have a whole bowl of... wait a minute, are the rest just potatoes? Wait, there were only 4 pieces of octopus for $16?! Oh heck no.\" In other words, great taste, tiny expensive portion.<br>-3 stars: Duck neck \"pate\". I'm misremembering the name but this was how the dish was explained to us.

Anyway, ventured here on a snowy Wednesday night while traveling for work in Chicago. The place was a mad house, but smelled amazing, and I decided it was definitely worth the hour + wait for 2. It's a really cute place, I can tell a lot of people were on dates or just looking for a fun time with a few friends. I felt like the median age was around 32. Every time a dish passed me while I waited at the bar, I wanted to knock someone off their bar stool and steal their food (and wine), everything looked so good! So we waited the hour plus for a table to open up and sat down around 8:15pm. <br><br>The wine list is pretty extensive and they offer 1/2 of their menu in 5oz pours of half bottles. Most of the wine is from Spain or Italy. The sommelier let me try 3 samples, before we decided on a half bottle. We ordered 4 dishes between us:<br><br>The food: <br><br>Brussel sprouts salad: definitely different than what I expected, but really tasty. I felt like it was more of a summer dish, as it was very light and zesty. Shredded lettuce, apples, pecans and brussel sprouts in a light dressing.<br><br>Eggplant caponata with goat cheese smear. 5 pieces of toasted bread with goat cheese smeared on it, then a dish with cut up pieces of eggplant, lima beans, and a variety of other vegetables in a tasty olive oil red sauce. Great starter.<br><br>For main courses we shared the Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki. This dish reminded me of being in Greece. I loved the tzatsiki and the chicken was nice and crispy. <br><br>We finished off with seafood carbonara, which was pretty good, probably my least favorite dish though. The mussels and shrimp were tasty and fresh, and the sauce was a lightly spicy marinara sauce. It was okay. <br><br>Now for the negatives...the staff there DROVE ME INSANE. They kept pouring water when I didn't need any, kept trying to take our dishes away when we weren't done, they kept hovering over our table like they wanted us to leave. LEAVE ME ALONE. AHHH!!! It wasn't our waiter either! It was the kitchen staff and they barely spoke any English. I said to them, don't take that dish away, and they did anyway. I said, I don't need water and they poured me more anyway. They legit took the fork out of my hand, what is that about?! It was extremely disruptive and annoying. I had to point that out because everything else was really good, but I just couldn't deal with the staff hovering over us like birds stalking their pray. When I'm done, I will put my dish to the side and leave my fork on it, so you know I'm done! ARG! They place itself is really loud too and if you're waiting, be prepared to have the ait staff push into you and ask you to move 100 times, which is pretty annoying.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tdK1TUVYutheaC2dWrfhsQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "Brussel sprouts salad.

The pork should is tender. But the spices tastes the same as the prepackaged corn beef from Walmart. <br><br>Overall it's more for an experience rather than the actual food.

Everything on the menu was so different. To start, we had the octopus with green beans, fingerling potatoes, and salsa verde. Everything on this plate was incredible. There was a perfect balance of all, and I especially loved the thick pieces of octopus. They were cooked to perfection. Next, we tried the bone marrow with herb salad and Sicilian sea salt. This is what I was most excited about, as it's so different. It was really good! The one marrow kind of just tastes like a sort of butter for your bread, and the sea salt and salad on top of it were incredible! The chef recommends spreading the marrow on the bread, followed by a pinch of salt, and then adding the salad. It was a great combo! Last, we tried the milk braised pork shoulder, mashed potatoes, and puffed farro. It had a lot of fatty pieces, but I loved the leaner pieces. They had great taste especially combined with the mashed potatoes. The puffed farro was probably my favorite part of this dish because it provided such a nice crunch.

Purple Pig was easily the best meal during my Chicago trip. <br><br>The menu here consists of Mediterranean-inspired small plates so they have a a variety of antipasti, fried items, cheeses and cured meats, and options that are cooked a la plancha (grilled on a metal plate). I was inundated with all of the enticing options! Eventually, my friends and I settled on a few dishes. <br><br>THE FOOD<br>-Pigs ears: I've heard so much about this item that I just had to order it. Fried pig's ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers, and a fried egg. We loved the contrast of the flavors (fried items and the pickled peppers) and textures (crispy ears/kale and the egg). Something about fried pig, egg, and vinegar was really comforting to me and reminded me of my grandmother's filipino food. I only wish the ears had a more porky flavor. Would order again! <br>-Chicken kebob: Herbed chicken on skewers with fried smashed potatoes and tzatziki. The bartender actually recommended this one. Chicken was flavorful and slightly charred but not dry. I loved the smashed potatoes and tzatziki as well. Would also order again. <br>-Wine Poached Foie Gras Torcheon: Holy shit! Just get this. <br>-Pork belly rillions with honey mead glaze: I thought the name was a bit redundant because mead is honey wine...right? Anyway, this was a super tasty combination of pork, fat, and that sweet glaze. I don't know if I would personally order this again but you cannot go wrong here.<br>-Lemon Panna Cotta with candied pistachios: This is what panna cotta should be like! Silky and pleasant with a nice contrast from the pistachios. I loved that the lemon was present without being overbearing. <br>-Sicilian Iris: A brioche style beignet filled with chocolate chips and ricotta. I'm honestly not too fond of ricotta but this was delicious! The dessert was chocolately and flavorful without being super heavy. <br><br>The wine list was impressive yet the craft beer selection was just ok. Considering all of the amazing breweries in the midwest, I was rather surprised. The mixed drinks are apparently solid too as Christina C loved her manhattan. <br><br>The wait was horrendous but that is expected considering the Purple Pig's popularity.

We were told that the wait is 30 to 40 minutes. We were finally seated after over an hour. To be honest, I did not mind this too much as their callback system is great. You are sent a text when your table is ready, so you can wait in one of the nearby bars (which there are plenty in the area), so not really a big deal.<br><br>We were seated in a communal table in the middle of two groups. The space is ridiculously small. I don't mind communal tables; I dine regularly at Avec and Publican, the space you get in this restaurant is significantly smaller compared to those in the other two. We could not even put two dishes side by side, the space was that narrow. <br><br>What's worse was the wait. It took our waiter 20 minutes to stop by and ask for drinks. When he finally arrived, it was clear why. He assumed we were with the group next to us and since he had taken their orders, he did not come back. This is a big managerial mistake. If you operate communal tables, you need to communicate your waiter(s) the groups much better. If not, you need to educate them to ask group size when they first take orders. This continued throughout the night, we were constantly asked if we ordered something when it was not our order. Apparently, they have no way of distinguishing different groups in the communal tables. <br><br>One the good side, their wine selection is very good. Also, I loved having the option of ordering half bottles for a good number of wines. But the markup is rather high; I paid $56 for a bottle of wine which you can find for $13 outside. 2-3 times markup is usual at restaurants, but 4+ times did not feel right. Having said that, I liked the wine we ordered at the end.  <br><br>Most importantly, the food was mediocre. Although we were not really that hungry, we ordered 5 dishes for two people to get a taste of different things. We started with fried brussel sprouts, which was the only good dish of the night. Very simple, but the lemon juice and thyme made it really nice. The second dish was fried olives with chorizo. Horrible! The olives were so sour, nothing else can be tasted. Next was the bone marrow. Bone marrow itself was very good, but the dish comes with a parsley/caper mix; nice touch but the parsley was the worst I have had in my life, very rough almost woody. Nobody should serve them, particularly not a restaurant calling itself Mediterranean inspired. The fourth dish was the house n'duja. There was really no spice whatsoever in the n'duja, extremely plain. The final dish was the chestnut mouse and caviar. This really sounded interesting as I am big chestnut favorite. Yet, the dish fell short again as the chestnut taste was completely overtaken by the caviar, not balanced at all. <br><br>I must admit I am a picky eater, particularly when it comes to Mediterranean food, but the overall experience was disappointing, particularly for almost $100 per person.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The food was good, it's a crazy small amount of food.

The waitress had a hard time getting plates out of the way and the bussers could not fill our water without have to ask us for our glasses.

It was good, I wish it was a little warmer though. I also got the lamb ribs which were really good and a little spicy. The 2 others in my group got the homemade gyro and the meatballs. The gyro was super tasty and was topped with beets and tomatoes and tons of taziki sauce. We also got the fried mashed potatoes with a creamy feta sauce. Those were also good but not super special.

Didn't taste any anchovy flavor at all<br>- Salt-roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio vinaigrette: YUM. One of my favorites. I love beets and particularly loved the combination with the tangy but light goat cheese, and the sharpness of the vinagrette. Seriously, YUM.<br>- Bone marrow! I love bone marrow and had it previously before, so I was happy to have it again. The bread was SO good--perfectly grilled to be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Perfect with the fatty, delicious bone marrow. I actually disliked the herb salad with my bone marrow because I thought it masked the flavor of it, so I ate it separately. <br>- Smoked pork tongue with tonnato sauce and salad olivier: another one of my favorites. Loved the smokiness of the pork with the freshness of the olivier salad. Wish there had been more though!<br>- Milk braised pork shoulder: I had gotten this last time as well, and had to have it again. Tasted just like I remember it: so tender and perfect on a bed of mashed potatoes and smothered in a jus made from the braising liquid (we had to ask what the yellow sauce was).<br><br>All in all, so good!

They were perfect. <br><br>Their wine selection was obviously carefully selected, and my two girlfriends each found a perfect pair for their respective \"main appetizer\".

There are small tables surrounding the walls of the restaurant, two bars (one at the bar and the other at the kitchen) and a few long family style tables in the center. We squeezed into a family style table with a family of 4 and three other couples, so 12 people total. To our luck, the dad sitting next to us was very friendly and offered us some Salt and Vinegar Beef Tendon Chips as we waited. These were crispy and vinegary pork rinds, not really salty.They were a-okay!<br><br>Our server was quick and to the point, which I liked but it also made me feel rushed to order. Overall, I wouldn't expect 5-star service at the Purple Pig but given the popularity factor, I understand the need to rush. To their defense, it helped because we didn't wait an absurd amount of time for our food. <br><br>After reading other reviews, I made sure to scrutinize our check at the end of our meal. We were mistakenly charged for a Moscow Mule that I did not receive. Back story: I had in fact ordered one but they did not have ginger beer at the bar. I guess they didn't take it off the check. In any case, if the food wasn't as HEAVENLY as it was, I'm not sure that I would have been able to overlook the lack of attention to detail, impersonal service and stuffy accommodations.<br><br>Now on to the food:<br><br>Fried Brussels Sprouts with Thyme, Lemon and Chili Flakes:  Crispy and lemony, this dish was simply seasoned enough to enjoy the strong Brussels sprout flavor yet still make an impact on your taste buds. <br><br>Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta:  Rich and savory, this smear delivered in every way. Slow cooked pork in a tomato sauce with a lump of ricotta dumped in the center. Paired with toasted bread, this was my favorite item on the menu.

Leave out the vinegar and let us savor all the protein richness it was meant to have.<br><br>Finally, we could not not resist ordering the Sicilian Iris, a fried brioche with a warm ricotta and chocolate filling.  See the photos, you'll understand.<br><br>If you like pork and willing to eat any part of the pig, the Purple Pig tries to give you a variety from pork foie gras to fried ears, tails etc.  Go with a group, try everything and have fun with it.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This place reminds me of some of the new restaurants that have opened in Detroit.  Original small plates.  The only difference is, the ones in detroit-even though packed, are more spacious.<br><br>The food was good, I enjoyed it.  I'm glad I got to try this place as it was on my radar.  I would go back, if there wasn't a wait.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "As a restauranteur, this place is spectacular from the minute you walk in to the minute you leave.

I thought that the cheese and honey paired very nicely with the cornbread, and the flavors worked well together. The octopus came with fingerling potatoes and green beans, and had a citrus finish that got stronger the more you ate it.

Everytime I come to Chicago, this is one of my must stops and everytime someone asks about a place to eat in Chicago, this is a must as well! What you can't miss here is the charcuterie plate. Order a couple meats and a cheese or the other way around if you're more of a cheese person. I opted for more of a semi-soft cheese and some of their different proscuittos. The cured meats were great and the cheese we got had just the right amount of aroma to it. From my experience, their cheese & meats rotates so hard to give a suggestion but definitely ask your server! So the food here is Tapas style so order more dishes! One of the tapas that we got that I loved was the smoked fish dish. They injected actual smoke into the jar so when it was uncovered, all this smoked just plumed out of the jar. The yogurt and their salmon had just the perfect balance to be a palate cleanser before our main dish. We got a porkchop for two and on the side of this dish, they had a bone marrow sauce that we were to spread all over the porkchop. This dish was amazing. You'd thing a huge porkchop with all this sauce and bone marrow glazed over it would be really heavy but it wasn't (or maybe it was our really good smoked fish that we had right before). There are so many things to try on the menu and they all seem great! The wine recommendations by our server were also point on. A white for our appetizer-tapa and a red for our pork. <br>Service: 8/10<br> The service here is great. A main thing to make a note of is that our server was great with recommendations of wine for our food. I already had in mind that our appetizers called for a white wine (given the crisp and freshness of the salad & yogurt in the dish) and that's exactly what the server recommended and he recommeded a great one at that. It gets really busy here so if you're having trouble flagging down your server, it's understandable but they were very great with checking on us and clearing old plates!<br>Overall: 9/10<br>Additional Notes: I love this place and it's set on this alleyway like street so it you get a decent view when you're waiting.

Although the octopus (squid?) is not like the type I usually have. It's not as chewy, more like a 'meat' taste. Still good.<br>The pig ear is not as satisfying perhaps it's too deep fried (I don't like deep fried food, in general). <br>Yelp categorizes TPP as mediterranean which I can't quite agree.

The atmosphere was warm and inviting, and the wait staff were very devoted to making you have a pleasant experience (not to mention young and also attractive).  <br><br>The food they say was \"meant for sharing\", I would say more like meant for tasting.

We ordered two appetizers: the Greek cornbread with feta cheese as well as the tuna and quail egg tartar. For the entree we had their proclaimed milk-braised pork shoulder.

The bone marrow came with a heaping of ultra fresh parsley and capers. <br><br>Lamb Ribs- These were delicious. I forget what was in the little salad underneath each of the ribs it included some pomegranate seeds and greens. <br><br>Milik Braised Pork Shoulder- Really good, rich pork flavor.   <br><br>Panino con Nutella- Not bad. I don't have much to say about this one. I preferred the brioche doughnut.<br><br>Sicilian Iris- This was awesome! Essentially a brioche doughnut filled with ricotta and chocolate. I devoured it.<br><br>This place has a great staff. They were very attentive.

We saw that it was open until 11 pm so we figured we would get a late dinner and didn't expect there to be many people there. When we got there around 8:30 it was decently full and they told us it would be about half an hour for a wait. No big, we went outside and had a nice walk and then they texted us almost exactly a half hour later saying our table was ready. When we go in, they had seated us at a long table that was filled with other patrons. The place they had reserved for us was in between two other parties and we would have to awkwardly sit next to each other, with one guy from the party next to us sitting in front of me. We don't mind waiting, so we asked the host if we could wait for a different spot at an actual table. She immediately found us a new table and sat us down! <br><br>First, our server was absolutely incredible. I wish I knew her name because she was so sweet. Being in the service industry myself, I truly value when the server explains what they believe is good on the menu and is honest with you, which is exactly what she did. <br><br>We started with the Taramasalata Greek spread..........omg. The spread was enormous and came with a tray of perfectly crispy bread. Later, upon seeing that we were running low on bread, a busser brought us a new tray, without us even asking!! Next, we had something from the fried menu, which were the Brussel sprouts. Incredible!!! I don't even know how they made brussel sprouts taste so delicious, but they did. We also ordered a spearfish and tuna dish- i believe that was what it was- the presentation was incredible, however it was very thin and came without any bread or cracker to put it on, so it was a little hard to eat. Then, we ordered our main meals. The chicken shish kabobs........wow. I wasn't too thrilled about ordering shish kabobs because so many times the chicken comes out so dry. How about the complete opposite!!! Some of them most juicy chicken I have ever eaten in my life!! It was on a bed of smashed potatoes and tzatziki sauce. Absolutely incredible combination. For the last dish, I wanted to order the gnocchi with ox tail, however the server recommended that we order a different pasta with a sausage sauce. When it came my boyfriend was absolutely thrilled and thought it was amazing, I however did not really love it and was still wishing I had gotten my gnocchi. A little later the server came over to check on us and asked what I had thought about the pasta, I told her about how it was good, but not my favorite, however I was so satisfied with the entire meal that I was not upset. Low and behold....5 minutes later she came over to me with the gnocchi! Totally not necessary and unexpected, but nonetheless so nice and truly made me feel so well taken care of. <br><br>Later, the server (i hate that i can't remember her name) told us that the owner/chef had started the restaurant when he was 26 and that the menu TWICE A DAY!!!!! twice. a. day. My boyfriend actually asked her to repeat that three times. Unreal.<br><br>Oh, and the most insane part, was that after five dishes (one free) and a glass of wine and two beers, are bill was only $100!! How is that even possible.<br><br>After we left, we were laying around and just could not stop talking about how good the food was. I want to return and try new things, but I don't know how i am not going to reorder the same things that we had on our first experience.<br><br>I am ready to leave my boyfriend and marry the chef, so i can eat this delicious food every day of my life until i die and somehow convince my server to live with me to have her be my best friend.

I was a little weary to try it, but it was actually really good! Very tasty, fatty, and mixed with the onions and seasonings it went perfectly with the toast. Of all 6, it was definitely one of my favorites<br><br>-Turkey leg: large, tasty, succulent, the juiciest turkey leg you'll ever have. Totally worth the food coma you'll experience right after<br><br>- Fried Manchego Cheese with Membrillo - mmm mmm yummm!! Talk about the best tasting fried cheese! Fingerlicking good. <br><br>-Chicken Thigh Kebabs - Now this was definitely a crowd pleaser. Juicy, seasoned to perfection, two whole kebabs. Food heaven. <br><br>-Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes - You absolutely cannot go to this place without trying this dish. It's a burst of flavors in your mouth and the mashed potatoes were perfect. <br><br>-Octopus - I'm not a fan of octopus, but one of the people at our table who seems to be obsessed with this dish thought it was absolutely delicious.

The chicken sausage was also very delicious - it almost tasted like veal, it was again super tender.  My husband loved the eggplant crostini more than I did.  Maybe I was too full by then but it was verging on being \"too salty\" and I would have liked a better quality goat cheese (it was more like a spread) on the thick slices of grilled bread.<br><br>Service was actually phenomenal (once the meal got ordered).  Our water glass was never less than 3/4 full before the water dude would fill our glasses up (even though there was a bottle of water on our table).  And when our plates got too messy between courses 2 and 3, we had not one, but two people rush over to replace our plates and silverware.

One server's attitude was extremely off-putting.  The server (thin, male, dark blonde) after we told him about how long we've waiting and that no one checked in on us and he basically told us we were lucky to even have a table.  I get it, PP doesn't take reservations and it was extremely packed during a rainstorm meaning diners probably didn't want to leave but isn't there a better way to speak to your patrons?<br><br>The food was ok.  Most of it was extremely salty.  The broccoli and crispy pig ears were good. <br><br>I can't recommend this restaurant to anyone and our party collectively decided it's not a place we'd like to revisit.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Favorite restaurant in Chicago so far.

Over seasoned, and then over compensated by a lemony acidic flavor. <br><br>Bone marrow - two very large portions (one bone split in half) accompanied by some bread, herb mixture, and salt. Very buttery and tasty. I don't think the salt is needed at all, because the herb mixture itself is already very \"flavorful\" and it has capers in it. Between the two of use, we each got a good half of a bone - slightly too much / fatty. (Apparently a few years back, they used to serve bone marrow in smaller portions).<br><br>The fried pork ears - probably the least salty of the three, comes with fried eggs, fried pork ears (kind of reminds me of eating calamari a bit), and (probably) fried kale. I feel the crispiness of the pork ear is lost by frying it, but then again, non-fried pork ear may not be so easily accepted by the masses. I also don't like how they suggest you to mixed everything up before you eat it..<br><br>We sat at the bar by the open kitchen, and I spoke of the Saltiness of the food several times, and noticed that at the end of my meal, the lady making the salad started tasting her mixtures before serving it. <br><br>Overall, didn't live up to my expectations.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "It was very overpriced and it felt like it was the same concept as girl and the goat but it wasn't as good as girl and the goat.

It lends to the energy and creates the Spanish Tapas vibe you would find in a hot tapas joint in Madrid.

Now that is crowded! <br><br>But the food comes out fast, delicious, balanced, thoughtful and craetive! Steeped in the foundations of Mediterranean flavors, PP knocks it out of the park with everything I have ever tried there! Octopus salad is so great; charred octopus that is tender but still maintains good texture, balanced with rich olive oil and zesty lemon to keep your palette singing for the next bite. Charcuterie is well thought out and always exactly what you expect, only tastier. Bone marrow is one of the best I have had in Chicago, and I appreciate that they split the bones lengthwise so serving is easier (you hear me Longman & Eagle??). And while I tend to over indulge in heavy and rich meats and cheeses, there are plenty of lighter plates, both cold and hot, salads and vegetable based that will make any table feel they have had all their senses satisfied beyond reasonable expectations!<br><br>I can't post this review without mentioning the service. Each of my visits I had a different server, and each time the service was thoughtful, prompt, and genuine. Recommendations for wine have been perfect each time and always made with value in mind, you won't find these servers offering you the most expensive bottle every time you ask for assistance.

No. But we waited 3 hrs. What's nice is that there's a lot to do not too far from The Purple Pig so we relaxed back at our hotel, grabbed some snacks to hold us for the 3 hrs, did some touristy things like going to the John Hancock building, etc. You can also leave your number with them so they can call you when your table is close to being ready.<br><br>We were seated out on their patio where they do provide heated lamps.<br><br>Their menu is condensed with a good variety in foods. Now this place is tapas which means small plates. So, expect to order a few dishes. Their wine list is very extensive with great choices (prices were also reasonable for full bottles).<br><br>The tapas we ordered:<br>1. Cauliflower- 3.5 stars. The cauliflower was cooked perfect and seasoned well. I loved the hint of lemon juice. However, expensive for just cauliflower.<br>2. Beets- 3.5 stars. The beets were cooked perfectly and paired very well with the goat cheese and vinaigrette. But I'm also biased because I love beets. So couldn't go wrong with this dish.<br>3. Pig's Ear- 4.5 stars. Don't let the name discourage you from ordering this dish. The fried egg was cooked perfectly and our server told us it's best served all mixed together. Each bite had a nice crunch packed full flavor. It was really good. But I just wish the portion was bigger!<br>4. Roasted Bone Marrow- 4 stars. They give you two pieces and each piece comes with plenty of bone marrow. All that fat gooey oily goodness to go on top of their perfectly toasted and fluffy bread. I recommend eating this while it's still hot. You don't want it to cool down because it solidifies and becomes unappetizing.<br>5. Foie gras- 4 stars. The foie gras spread was very good. Not too rich with a hint of sweetness. Their bread was delicious, they give you more bread upon request. It also comes with a jam that's pretty good.<br>6. JLT (Pork Jowl) - 5 stars. Which is pig face/cheek. The meat was very tender. The fried duck egg on top was cooked perfect and was a perfect combination. We should have ordered 1 per person. It was delicious!<br>7. Razor Clams- 5 stars. I really liked this dish and I loved the seasoning on top of it. The clams were chewy yet tender and packed full of flavor.<br>8. Octopus- 5 stars. This had a very similar if not exact same dressing as the razor clams. Delicious. The octopus tentacles were cooked perfectly.<br>9. Chicken Thigh Kebabs- 3 stars. Just average. Some pieces were juicy while some were on the dryer side. The sauce was tasty however.<br>10. Pork Shoulder- 4.5 stars. The pork shoulder was very good. It was super tender and juicy. However, the gravy was very salty. Luckily the gravy covered mostly the mashed potatoes and not the pork shoulder. I love mashed potatoes, but it was hard to eat because it was super salty.<br>11. Sicilian Iris- 4 stars. Just a perfect dessert. Who can complain about a chocolate chip filled brioche. It was just like eating a beignet, but fluffier more bread and less fried.<br><br>I was very happy with everything and because it's tapas I wasn't overstuffed and I was able to try everything.<br><br>Our server was also awesome. He was super friendly and helpful. Our food came out in spurts. A few dishes would come out then there would be a pause where we had no food for a while then our table would be filled again with more dishes.

Famished from a long day of activities, such feelings I had my party did not know we could feel in the amount of time--hunger, deliriousness, desperation and finally acceptance. <br><br>While waiting, we decided to split a couple bottles of wine. Yes, drinking before we even got into the restaurant, but maybe that's how Socal girls do it. Just kidding, we were just super hungry and figured sipping on wine would help us forget our hunger. It was awesome how diverse their wine menu was in terms of vineyards and pricing. Definitely makes it all the more tempting to enjoy a bottle or two when you're here. <br><br>When we finally got seated, we've had plenty of time to decide what we were going to eat. These were the following items we got: <br> <br>*Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg - My favorite part of the night! Crispy fried pigs ears and baked kale that tasted just like chips. This is a must-try for all you fried food lovers out there. <br><br>*Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs - Perhaps there's something wrong with me. This is the second time I've had bone marrow and again, I just couldn't enjoy it. Everyone else had no problem eating it, so maybe I just have some weird aversion to bone marrow. This was served with thick slices of garlic bread and large sea salt to accompany the bone marrow. <br><br>*Foie Gras & Membrillo - The foie gras was also served with bread, but the pieces actually resembled bruschetta more. There was also jam to complement the foie gras. This dish was just okay, though not really memorable. There wasn't a lot of flavor in the foie gras, so I'm not quite seeing what the hype is over it in general.<br><br>*Proscuitto Stuffed Squid  - You got your proscuitto and you got your squid. Can't really go wrong here. <br><br>*Cheese platter of various cheeses<br><br>I'd love to return here some day but I'd probably order other items on the menu.

Considering it was the summer, it made me felt heavy and that it should've been on the winter menu instead. <br><br>The pig's ear and lamb chops were both FRIED. The frying made both dishes extra heavy and completely takes away the flavor and freshness that comes so natural to these two items.

The pig's ear, on the other hand, was too salty and felt a bit too much like eating salted fried dough.<br><br>For our entrees we ordered the Greek chicken, which is cooked sous-vide, and at our server's recommendation, the milk braised pork shoulder. The chicken was exceptionally tender, but we found the character of the sauce not really for us. The pork shoulder, on the other hand, was delicious. The meat was moist and tender, and the sauce, which almost blends with the mashed potatoes, was rich, creamy, and delicious.<br><br>After all this food, I was reluctant to go for dessert, but my girlfriend convinced me to get the Sicilian Iris, and I have no regrets. The pastry was warm and soft with a lightly crispy outer shell, and the filling achieved the right balance of cheese, chocolate, and sugary flavors. The dish is also very pretty, and the neighboring table inquired as to what we had ordered.<br><br>One thing to note though is that the restaurant is very cramped and loud.

Super briny and the brightness of the lemon helped to interject some needed \"palate cleansing\" after three courses of pure richness. Perfectly cooked too, not a bit over done. <br><br>5.) Milk Braised Pork Shoulder<br>     Back to richness! This may have been my \"least\" favorite thing I had, but when I say that, I mean it was only a 9 out of 10 compared to the perfect score of everything else. Yes, it was rich, the milkiness definitely came through but I think it was just a tad under seasoned. A little more salt would have brought it up to a 10!<br><br>6.) Octopus with Salsa Verda<br>     Fantastic! I've never had octopus before, guess I was kind of a \"Pus\" but I did not regret trying it. It had great consistency and super flavorful with the salsa verda on top.<br><br>7.) Wagyu Beef<br>     This ties as my favorite next to the \"JLT\" for sure.

For dessert, we shared the 'Sicilian Iris,' which was a ricotta & chocolate chip filled fried brioche - think of a fried donut that is heavenly and you want to just be encased in - a huge favorite of mine.  The dessert item was the dessert panin, with Nutella hazelnut spread, 1 slice of a small banana, and marshmallows  - it could have had more slices of bananas, but it was a favorite among my friends.  Overall, the dining experience was nice, and the food always came out quite quickly (since these are small dishes).  Get the Pig Ears, the Almonds, and the Iris - you will not leave disappointed, and I would order these by the dozen when I come back.  The place gets jampacked and loud, and they offer an array of wine and cheeses as well.  Metered parking can be found up along Illinois.<br><br>+'Pork Fried Almonds with Rosemary & Garlic' <br>+ 'Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Marinated Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg'<br>+'Sicilian Iris' for dessert", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I have no idea why is this being rated so high.

All four dishes we ordered were incredible.  The salt-roasted beets and greek cornbread were so unique and delicious.

The octopus was tender and the outside was well done enough so that it had a slightly crisp texture. I bit in and noticed how easy it was to break down the meat while chewing. The dish came drizzled with olive oil and what I believe was pesto. Satisfaction.<br><br>Bone Marrow: Everyone seems to order it here, and while very unique in its presentation, it was my least favorite dish of the night. It is served with 3 large bones and 5 slices of grilled bread. There's definitely way more marrow than bread so I tried to slather as much of the gelatinous spread on as possible. When I took my first bite, what came to mind was savory, hot blubber. It was pretty tasty when accompanied with herbs and salt, but in terms of flavor, it was the least unique.<br><br>Pork shoulder in mashed potatoes: When my girlfriend used her spoon to take a slice of the pork, it cut through like a knife. The whole dish was amazing with the pork being very tender and the mashed potatoes complementing the pork.<br><br>Turkey Leg: True star of the meal. I really wish my thanksgiving turkey tasted like this- the meat was so tender and the sauce it was cooked with was delicious. It tasted sweet and had a subtle vinegary flavor as well.

If you come on a Sunday, shops nearby close pretty early though. We liked the communal seating, but the tables and walls are so close together that it seemed difficult for staff to move around. So..intimate, yes, but could become an awkward arrangement when food is being served and plates bussed. <br><br>Foodwise, I would give a solid 4 stars. We ordered chorizo stuffed olives, grilled leeks, pigs ear, roasted bone marrow, prosciutto stuffed squid, and an affogato. The chorizo stuffed olives and sauce of the prosciutto stuffed squid had similar flavors and given the chance, I wouldn't order them together again. The squid was tender and its stuffing savory and interesting, definitely my favorite. Grilled leeks were unexpectedly served cold, but I would recommend! <br><br>Pigs ear was tasty, but I love my salty foods. Someone with milder preferences would probably think it was too much. Also, neither of us could distinguish the taste of pigs ear from the crunchy kale. I think it would have benefitted from another fried egg on top to balance out the saltiness. Lastly, the bone marrow! The bone itself was huge and had more than enough marrow for the slices of bread. The quantity of food that we ordered was perfect (if not a little too much) for 2 people, with this plate making up the bulk of the meal. However, the bread was so disappointing :( I'm hoping we just got unlucky but our bread was very fried. Not toasted, but fried and oily, which didnt pair well with the richness of the bone marrow. The addition of the salad helped undercut the richness a little bit, but the acidic flavor of the salad and the heaviness of the bread completely drowned out the bone marrow. <br><br>Overall, we had an enjoyable experience.

And judging by how packed this place usually is, it's a lot of people's favorite as well. I would recommend coming here at off-peak hours on the weekends (grab a late lunch at 3 PM, or grab a late dinner at 10) or during the week if you don't want to wait for an hour or more. However, since it's right on the mag mile you can wander around while you wait, as they'll just give you a call when your table's ready. The seating is mostly communal although there are a few private tables, and I'd recommend giving the communal seating a chance if you're normally not a fan. It's roomy enough to be comfortable, and it's quiet enough so you don't have to yell at your friend sitting a few inches away from you. The ambiance is very fun and lively, but not overwhelmingly so.  <br><br>The food comes out on an as-ready basis, and is always fresh and flavorful. My favorite antipasti is the olive oil poached tuna, which comes with poached quail egg, blue potatoes and really yummy roasted veggies. Their menu does change, but this has been a staple every time I've been. The charred cauliflower is also always on the menu, and is spectacular. The dish comes with little cornichons that compliment the smoky flavors. I would definitely recommend trying a couple of cheeses and cured meats (the duck prosciutto is awesome), if you're confused about what the cheeses are you can ask your server or check a lamp, which has a glossary attached. The Purple Pig always has an impressive selection, and I've never been disappointed with the charcuterie I 've ordered there.<br><br>My only issue is that the entrees can have way, way too much salt. To the point that it's almost unpleasant to eat. I am admittedly exceptionally sensitive to salt, but honestly this seems to depend on the chef seasoning it and there's no way to tell in advance. However, the times where the dishes have been salted to my tastes, they have been exceptional. If it's still there when you go, try the wagyu sirloin dish or their octopus if you're not feeling steak that day. The steak is cooked to total perfection and is just a stellar cut of meat (and a generous portion too!), and while the octopus may be a little tough from grilling it is still extremely tasty. What I love about the octopus dish is that what it comes with (fingerling potatoes, green beans) are also incredibly flavorful, you won't leave anything behind on this plate!<br><br>All in all, the Purple Pig is a place I would recommend to anyone in the Chicago area.

This dish was topped with a sunny side up egg, fried just to the right degree so the yolk was runny enough to be mixed with the dish. The pig's ear was interesting, deep fried and oh-so-sinful.

Chicago really showed me that sunny side up eggs go well with meat (think of Au Cheval's cheeseburger and Girl and the Goat's Pig Face). While quite flavorful, crispy, and delicious, I did feel like there was an overload in the kale. <br><br>Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs and Sea Salt: 4.5/5 -- Served with bread. The bread itself was not the best I have ever had but pretty good nonetheless. The bone marrow is melted and can be scraped with a knife (like butter) and put on the bread. Very intriguing dish, and I have never seen anything like it. <br><br>Pig Shoulder: 3.5/5 -- There is a lot of hype about the pig shoulder. Cheesy mashed potatoes with pork blended with milk. Unfortunately, I found the dish good but not mind-blowing. It definitely could have used more flavor. <br><br>Octopus: 5/5 -- Like Yelp's description of a five star restaurant, this dish was as good as it gets. So much flavor! I am not huge of veggies (as you can see from my dish selection), but I ate every last green bean and devoured the delicious potatoes (yes, potatoes are vegetables). <br><br>Almond Dessert: 4.5/5 -- Apologies for forgetting the exact name of the dessert, but very solid dessert! The cake was hot and fresh, and I had never tried something like the jelly served with the cake. <br><br>Expect to pay around $40 if you don't buy alcohol.

We had heard from others that some have had to wait 3 hours for a table--that was enough to scare us into going in in the early afternoon to ask the hostess what time would be best for us to come in to be seated for dinner. They suggested 4:30pm to be seated by 5--we were worried for nothing!! I'm sure if would be different if it was the weekend. <br><br>I'll start with the food, get to the service later.<br><br>WHAT WE GOT:<br>1) Pig ear with crispy kale and a fried egg: we agreed this was our favorite! Usually pig ear is a bit chewy and you get the crunch of the cartilage when you bit it---this was not the case! The fried pig ear with the sunny side up egg mixed in, the crispy kale, etc. was absolutely perfect. I'd love to have that for dinner as a stand alone!!<br>2) Charred cauliflower w/ cornichons and parsley: good but not great. I don't think we thought this was anything too special.<br>3) Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta: This was good, but again we felt like this was just a ragu--with some ricotta at the bottom. It was pretty filling though because they give you big pieces of bread (this is labeled under smears). <br>4) Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs: mMmmm who doesn't love fatty bone marrow? Spread on warm, toasty bread?? Topped with herbs and sea salt??? We are big fans fo bone marrow, so we weren't disappointed by this dish (also a smear). <br>5) Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes: good but not great--the pork shoulder was salty which evened out with the mash. It was eh to me.<br>6) Waygu beef cooked for 30 hrs with fois gras: I think this was a dinner special for the day because I can't find it on the site's menu! So good--beef was so tender and soft, and fois gras was perfect. It came with an arugula onion mix on the side.<br><br>As a party of 3 we were way too full to get dessert :( but we did have the white and red sangrias--both equally yummy! <br><br>SERVICE:<br>Service was sooooo so attentive!! But maybe too attentive for our taste. Our plates were cleaned/replaced and our dishes taken away so quickly, there was no time to think. In addition, it almost made it seem like they were rushing us to finish our food because they had clean plates to give us. AND on top of that, we had only eaten one dish before they took away our plates to give us new ones. What??? I think plates are changed too often--it interrupts conversation and also takes away from enjoying our food at a good pace or having to interrupt runners to tell them we're not done yet, or that we are ALMOST done. Meh. :/ After the 3rd change of plates we were just thinking it was too much. <br><br>TLDR: food is good depending on what you get; I think it's a bit overhyped; everything is very savory/heavy; service is attentive but maybe too much so.

When I got there (15 degrees out), I had just arrived at the airport, cabbed to my hotel, cabbed to The Purple Pig, and then was told the wait was about an hour and a half. Since this was my first night venturing about Chicago, I decided to take a brisk walk... Unfortunately, it was about 9:30p and everything around had already closed shop... The Magnificent Mile was still magnificent, though. Adds a bit of romance to the city when you pass by Cartier in freezing weather while starving your bottom off... (o_O wtf? I know...)<br><br>When I got back to the restaurant, I was promptly seated, my order was taken the moment I was ready, the food was perfectly timed so there wasn't too much food sitting on the table getting cold. This is the type of establishment where you order 2-4 small plates per person and share amongst the table. It's a great way to nosh on a little of everything. <br><br>Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg - SPLENDIDLY served in the cutest little pork shaped bowl. The textures were amazing and the pop of the salt in the pickled peppers mixed with the crunch of the crispy kale and richness of the runny fried egg was mouthwatering to say the least.<br><br>Potato and Speck Croquettes with Calabrian Chili Aioli - I don't quite remember this dish as one that stood out, but it wasn't bad...<br><br>Jamon Serrano with Oyster Mushrooms & Fried Duck Egg<br>over Grilled Bread - I love anything with fried egg and bread, so I had to order this... Again, amazing, but if you were to get just one fried egg dish, I'd go with the pig's ear.<br><br>Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - buttery, creamy, awe-inspiringly tender pork, fluffy clouds of mashed potatoes... I loved it.<br><br>Now I realize why they don't accept reservations... If they did, I probably wouldnt be able to get a table until 2015. It's worth the wait.

I tried my very best to consume it, but the salt level... Wow, comparable to drinking ocean water. The potatoes were to die for though. <br>Half Duck Confit, Greek Yogurt, Smoked Trout Roe, and Brioche Buns - The skin of the duck was extremely salty, like the majority of the dinner; however, it was extremely tender. It's the kind of tender where it literally falls off the bone. Definitely a very big portion though. <br>Lamb Ribs w/ Harissa, Treviso Marmalade, Trahana, and Orange - I would pass on this, comparable to BBQ ribs, nothing special. <br><br>Overall, it was like $150 all inclusive of tax and gratuity for four people.

We took her advice and ordered the braised baby artichokes and fingerling potatoes. This appetizer was watery, vinegary mess. All you could taste was vinegar. It just wasn't appetizing. Our paninis came out next and the only reason Purple Pig gets 2 stars from me is that the panini was somewhat decent.

The meatball slider on a brioche bun with arugula and some grated pecorino romano is sheer heaven and just 6 dollars. <br><br>The wine list is intimidating if you're not a sommelier (or a true wine aficionado) and you're a daily drinker of wines under 10 dollars, so I asked my server to recommend a wine which would pair well with my lunch. She suggested one of the lighter reds with an herbaceous and berry finish and since I love grenache, she suggested the Honora Vega. <br><br>Wines come in four sizes: 5 oz, 8 oz, half-bottle and bottle. This was 14 for the 8 ounce and 20 for the half-bottle, so quite reasonable. My iPhone died and since I came alone after a 3 mile walk by Lake Shore Drive, I had nothing to read. Fortuitously, they had the December food issue of the New Yorker, which furnished two hours of stimulating reading as I sipped my wine and savored every bite of the meal.

I had been told by a friend how when they had gone to Chicago, they had tried to go on one of their last nights, but the wait to get a table had been hours, and they alas did not make it. I strategically decided to make this restaurant my first dinner stop on a Thursday night as I figured it would be less busy. I was rewarded with a 1.5-1.75 hour wait at 8:00 pm, which turned into more of a 1 hour and 10 minute wait. That same weekend I couple I knew went on a later night and it was a 2.5 hour wait, so my strategic planning paid off.<br><br>First off, it was worth the wait. And all we did while we waited was check out some of the clothing shops on the Magnificent Mile. I think this is a restaurant does everything right. (except their beer selection, but they are a wine bar) I love their menu, and the variety on it. Initially we were torn between which smears to get, so we were gonna get two smears for two people. We were warned by the waitress that it would be too much bread, so we got The Wedge salad instead of a second smear. The Wedge (iceberg wedge, beef bacon, heirloom tomatoes, blue cheese dressing) was delightful. The dressing had just the right amount of blue cheese, as it wasn't overpowering. The smear we landed on was the Pork Neck Bone Rillette with Mostarda. I highly recommend ordering a smear when you are there, and I definitely enjoyed this one! The mostarda added a nice amount of sweetness, and you definitely don't need too much on each slice of bread. Btw, don't forget to ask for more bread if you run out! It is FREE.<br><br>For our main, we had the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes and gravy, which is one of the dishes they are known for. It was really yummy as expected, but the thing that surprised me the most was the reasonable price attached to it. There wasn't any prices on their menu online so I had no idea what this place would cost, but the milk braised pork shoulder came out to 13 bucks, which to me was a steal. Overall, our meal was totally satisfying and was the most reasonably priced of all the fancier places we ate in Chicago. So I can see why this place is so popular! For dessert we had the Lemon Panna Cotta with Candied Pistachios. The funnest part about it was the candied lemon rind in the panna cotta. If you are looking for something light after your meal I would totally recommend this, as I loved it!<br><br>If you are planning a trip to Chicago and are wondering where you should eat in a short amount of time, I would definitely say add this place to your list!

We were the lucky winners of a \"mistake dish\"! What a great start to the meal. <br><br>I had done my research and came up with a list of things to try. We began with the calamari with fregula, radishes, cucumbers, cous cous, & pistachios. Being the least commonly appreciated flavor, we were startled by the bitterness of this dish, but also enjoyed its irregularity. Then came one of my favorites, the salt-roasted beets, whipped goat cheese, & pistachio vinaigrette. Yum yum yum. <br><br>Onto the main part of our meal. We had the pig's ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers, & fried egg. Although it was not as good as the reviews I read made it out to be, I can now officially saw I have eaten pig's ear and I'd say that's pretty cool. Next was the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. Oh. my. god. We almost ordered another - IT WAS MELT IN YOUR MOUTH DELICIOUS! <br><br>And finally, for dessert, even though we could barely fit it, we split the peanut butter semi-freddo with goat milk caramel corn and ginger-white chocolate mousse. Usually I am not a huge fan of peanut butter, but the best dessert I have ever had was a semi-freddo and they rarely appear on dessert menus, so it was a \"must try\". My friend loved it and the flavors were distinct, not too sweet, and a great combination of milky, sticky, crunchy, and soft. <br><br>We left absolutely stuffed and still had money in our pockets.

I wasn't very hungry at 6pm so I ordered roasted beets with goat cheese and pig ears with a glass of chianti to start, and while the first dish came out within 15 minutes (perfectly prepared beets with velvety whipped goat cheese and crunchy pistachio pieces creating a pleasant contrast of flavor and texture) I completely lost appetite while waiting for my second appetizer to arrive. I watched at least twenty of the same dish being prepared in front of my eyes and served while patiently waiting, and ended up calling the manager to inquire about my order. My server checked in with me once during the entire evening after taking my order (and an hour from then), asking if I would like another glass of wine. How about my food...? Turned out there was an error (I believe no order was put in). Completely unacceptable. This is while he is chitchatting with the customer next to me, still with zero apologies and a lot of attitudes. <br><br>The manager apologized and brought another glass of wine, and the chef recognized an unhappy customer, which brought back some hope for the restaurant and recovered one star. When my pig ear finally came out it was probably pretty good, but I wasn't in the mood to enjoy it any longer - too bad. It's very rare for me to leave a restaurant angry, especially with decent food. <br><br>If I ever come back here then I hope Dan is my server. He was busily handling orders from the kitchen to the tables in the dining area and still gave me the best personal recommendations with a smile as I sat and watched various dishes leaving the kitchen for 20 minutes before my server introduced himself. Dan also noted me getting upset after waiting over half an hour between two small plates and asked if everything was okay even though he wasn't responsible for me, and apologized for the wait after checking on my order with the chef. He was the saving grace of the evening for me. <br><br>Overall, the food itself would get a solid 3.5-4 stars, and I really hope they work on improving the quality and consistency of service.

We're seated in the outdoor patio area at one of their communal tables, which is annoying since it means we'll have to sit with other people, something apparently Scout knew when he put our name down. My appearances at the animal hospital the last month or so have been sporadic to say the least. All I seem to want to do now is work on my compost, refute NPR articles in the comment sections, and volunteer to hold committee meetings for non-profits and then cancel at the last minute. The decor inside the restaurant is slightly kitsch, exposed duct work and the tops of barrels stacked against the walls. I've been considering starting a pedagogy reading group.<br><br>Our waitress starts us off with drinks. I order my go-to drink, a mojito, which was Ernest Hemingway's preferred drink of choice. The tartness of the limes lay the base for a sweet and savory palate. The crushed mint is potent, suggesting freshness, and the use of light rum makes for a pleasingly refreshing  surprise, though I usually prefer an aged rum for its complexity, this isn't bad. So for tonight at least, the waitress is safe. <br><br>The conversation buzzing around me: Hamilton, deliberate action, cooperative economic development and mutual aid support systems that nurture physical health, if putting your iPhone in uncooked rice really works, economic stability, the ocean is running out of oxygen (WTF), emotional and intellectual growth, Derrick Rose's ankles, upspeak, Black Chyna as social feminist, revolutionary solidarity across gender, race and class lines, vocal fry. Our waitress appears and asks if we're ready and I blurt out, \"How is this all MY responsibility?\" Half of the table keeps talking while some are suddenly quiet and looking around. Before the waitress flees I grab her wrist and order the roasted bone marrow with herb salad and Sicilian sea salt, which I immediately regret, but it's too late. The rest of the table follows suit and orders.<br><br>Smash-cut to plates of food being placed before us. Since I'm on a carb depletion regimen I don't eat the bread that comes with my meal, but I do enjoy the marrow cradled inside the thick, roasted bones, scooping one out completely and hefting it over my head like a hominid in Stanley Kubrick's 2001, though no one at my table gets it. <br><br>The marrow is soft yet maintains a consistency that doesn't break down and liquefy on your palate, less greasier than I imagined, hitting unique notes, a tonally consistent flavor profile, mixing well with the white onions in the herb salad, cutting into the marrow's richness for clarity. I overhear Atticus talking to Bae about his persistent headaches. I ask about the quality of his sleep. I talk about electric and magnetic fields and how they disrupt our circadian rhythms, explaining primitive man and his superior sleeping habits. But Atticus' face scrunches up and suddenly I'm gripped with panic. \"Who told you that?\" He says. I can literally feel a cold hand clench around my spine. \"It's not because of brain waves or whatever sh*t you're saying,\" he says. \"Those tribes slept so little because they're attuned to the environment's light and temperature pattern.\" The rest of the table is looking away from me, averting their eyes, obviously embarrassed for me. As if everyone knew this already. As if I was the only one operating on this illusion, and to witness it being shattered is too painful for them to watch. I'm swallowing a lot of blood. \"Because of the earth's natural tempo,\" Atticus says, \"their quality of sleep is so much richer than ours. Our bodies don't cycle with the environment anymore. That's why you should get a natural light lamp to reset your internal clock.\" Devin asks about everyday use. Atticus suggests buying a thermostat that naturally ebbs to the eco conditions outside, to assist in triggering our body temperature to adjust for sleep or waking. The table continues talking about something else, leaving me in my silence.

However, due to not being particularly hungry, I didn't eat any signature items. My absolute favorite was the beets with goat cheese. I usually am not a beets fan, but it was incredible.

In fact, I also sampled the fried cheese appetizer my friends got and it was also very yummy.

The kale and fried egg in the pig's ear were very good, as was the pig ear which was cut in very thin strips and fried crispy. Anything fried is delicious!! Pork shoulder was tender and heavenly,  I think they sold out soon after we got ours. The meatball slider was tasty too, the slightly sweet bun complemented the meatball well.

The staff was so friendly and accommodating to those waiting for a table.<br><br>We took our seats eager to try as many things as we could since the menu was so delicious looking. As a point, the portions are fairly small so be prepared to order a few things, I actually like this style because you can affordably try many different things. The wife and I split 6 different dishes, and they go as followed:<br><br>-Deep fried green olives stuffed with chorizo. <br><br>We did not like this because everything just got lost in itself, it was all salt and little flavor, I expected a kick from the chorizo but could not taste it at all, however, it was only $5, so not that big of a deal.<br><br>-Calamari and Israeli couscous. <br><br>This dish was amazing; my only complaint is it wasn't never ending! There were a couple of bites that had too much salt stuck to it but as a whole the dish was great. It was a perfect blend of textures and the calamari was amazingly cooked. A total win for me.<br><br>-Foie Gras. <br><br>Now this was not real Foie gras, rather, it was more like a mouse but it was still delicious, and it was great with their accompanied fruit relish. I would order this over and over again.<br><br>-Neck bone gravy/sauce. <br><br>I was sooo excited for this but it was the biggest let down of the night. I think whoever was salting the dishes this night got a little too excited; this dish was almost inedible due to the sodium level. The fresh ricotta helped cut the saltiness a bit. The meaty neck pieces were good when stripped of the sauce; it was juicy and very tender.<br><br>-Charcuterie and cheese platter. <br><br>This dish was decent, however, in comparison to other local platters the purple pig is far behind in quantity and quality. Nothing amazing, but also nothing bad. The pork Agra Dulce was my favorite.<br><br>-Sweetbreads.<br><br>These sweetbreads were cooked perfectly and had an amazing breading; the biggest downside was the sauce that was served under it, complete salt lick. We had to remove the sweetbreads from the plate to salvage them; once we did that they were spot on! <br><br>I was a little bummed because I wanted to try one of the more overrated dishes in the culinary world... Bone marrow, do not get me wrong, it is a good dish, however, as a Asian I have a hard time paying for something that previously you could get for free at the butcher. It has become a very trendy item in the foodie world which in turn increases the prices for a dish that should not just be glorified for its flavor but mostly for its sustainability and versatility. It is interesting to see the food of the \"poor\" become a coveted item for the higher-end restaurants. The peasant food has risen against its oppressor and is now king, I am excited for this since growing up eating mostly the things people would never eat, the downside is having to pay an arm and a leg for it... no pun intended. Long story short, they were not serving marrow this weekend. <br><br>I really had to give this place 3 stars because it was A-OK, would I go back? Sure, would I give my first born up so I could come back, probably not..... Give this place a try and get several things, be careful though, it can add up, but be sure to try as much as you can, especially things you have never tried before, because  you never know when you will find something that you have been missing your whole life!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/m2Lx3NiMcFHw-nxYyLwKGQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "Sweet breads"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uBF2V52ajE0VlIh3FUALoA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Meat & cheese"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rtZ7fO6xDrEwRy2VERdNKg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Neck bone gravy"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes- I love braised pork!

I just recently moved to Chicago and have heard non-stop about the Purple Pig, but also about the terribly long wait. My girl friend and I decided to go there right after work this week and we only had about a 15 minute wait, totally worth it! I am from Denver and this restaurant really reminds me of places there: lots of wood, metals, textures, close quarters, small tables, inspired menus, plenty of flannel, beards, and an upscale hipster vibe. This is not the place to go if you want a quiet place to linger, it's loud with ahhhmazinggg jams bumping in the background. My friend and I definitely got down to Estelle's \"American Boy\" (I mean how can you not dance to that song!) <br>I was really impressed with the wine list. From first glance, Purple Pig seems like the kind of place that would have a very inspired, cocktail heavy menu, but they actually place the emphasis on wine. Of course, you are welcome to get a delicious cocktail as well, but with a wine list this good, you may not want to miss it! I love the focus on international vines; they take the Mediterranean focus to the extreme by offering Greek wines, which are extremely underappreciated but so tasty! <br>Once we ordered some great Burgundy reds, we turned our attention to the menu. I used to be someone who was anti-pork-I guess I always pictured those cute pygmy pigs ending up on my plate. Well, these thoughts disappeared once I took a look at the menu. We went all out and ordered 4 different plates (more than enough for two people). My favorite was the pig ear and kale salad-crispy, salty, and flavorful deliciousness. Not too oily, not too crunchy, the ingredients struck a perfect balance with one another. Second place was the braised cauliflower. I want to serve this at Thanksgiving, it was so nurturing, buttery, the perfect texture, all without being too heavy. The bone marrow was next, which, judging by fellow Yelpers, is one of the highlights of the restaurant. I have to say, it was spectacular, but my favorite thing about it was the herbed salad served with it. The bones are huge, so be prepared. Make sure and combine all the ingredients for maximum satisfaction: bread (lightly buttered), bone marrow, sea salt, and salad, the perfect little sandwich. Last up was the short rib. We were almost hoping it didn't come because by this time a food coma was setting in. But it did come, and we did our duty and ate it. And enjoyed the heck out of it! The sauce that is served with this is fascinating: a combination of roasted red peppers and a pesto that is pretty sweet to the taste, and when combined with the salty smokiness of the short rib, you get a burst of harmonious flavor. It was fabulous, but we couldn't finish it! However, we were able to order and eat all of our dessert. We decided on the Greek fried dough with honey and cinnamon, a perfect light ending to a filling meal. <br>I was certainly overly impressed by the Purple Pig. Sometimes these celebrity chef restaurants can fall short of expectations, but Purple Pig did nothing but exceed mine. Go here, wait in line, have a glass of outstanding wine while you wait, and enjoy that pygmy pig on your plate.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Of course we had to try this place out after seeing everyone I knew who went to Chicago eat at this place.  This place is smack dab in the middle of downtown so parking can be expensive in one of the nearby garages.  I had heard horror stories about the wait since they don't take reservations so our party of 4 arrived at 4:00pm on a sunny Tuesday afternoon.  No wait at all!  <br><br>This seems like a small restaurant once you walk inside which explains the long waits.  There are 3-4 main long communal tables, seating at the bar, and a few regular tables along the walls.  We ordered:<br><br>_Pigs Ear with Crispy Kale and Fried Egg - This was pleasantly delicious.  I was weary cuz I had never tried pig ear, but the combination with the Kale and Egg was PERFECT!<br>_Roasted Bone Marrow - Easily the best bone marrow I have ever tried.  Comes with the perfect bread to spread the marrow on.  We ended up asking for more bread though -- it was a lot of bone marrow.<br>_Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Tzatziki - This dish comes with fried potatoes.  The Tzatziki  sauce (or as I like to call it: white halal sauce) was the perfect compliment to the chicken and potatoes.  Since there is no kids menu, this is what we ordered for my 7 year old nephew.  He (and I) LOVED this!<br>_Milk Braised Pork Shoulder - The meat was very tender but unfortunately was very salty.  Good that they paired this with mashed potatoes which helps mask the saltiness.<br>_Cape Cod Mussels - Not mind blowing, but very yummy.  Texture of mussels was not tough and the sauce that it comes in compliments it well.<br>_Waygu Short Ribs - Unfortunately this was the only disappointing dish of the meal.  It's a korean short rib but they use some spices and sauce that did not go well with the meat.  They gave us two cuts but we didn't finish them.<br>_Sicilian Iris - we ordered this for dessert.

I was informed that the restaurant doesn't take reservation but will take my name down. I asked how much earlier should I arrive on Friday 7:30pm and was told about an hour wait will be sufficient. Having been there in past and waiting over an hour for table for 3, I called 2nd time to check on wait times and was told the same.<br><br>On evening of dinner, we all arrives at restaurant at 6:30pm and were told of 3.5 hrs of wait!! I got really upset and told them that is way off from an hour of wait I was told. The manager lady told me they never tell people any wait times because they change. But, I was upset that I had a 3 yr old that can't wait 3.5 hrs and there is no way I was going to find a table to 7 at a good restaurant walking in. I called for the owner (also the chef) and he was very nice but told me the same thing as the manager. The manager lady told me she will try her best to get me a table if possible within the hour.<br><br>We left the restaurant and went to a local sandwich/pasta shop to feed our 3 old knowing that we wouldn't get a call anytime soon. However, the manager bent backwards and found us a table in 15 minutes and called. We just began feeding our kid so said we won't be able to come quickly. The manager said she will give away this table but will find another table after half hour. She called us again after half hour with a table and our relatives from California were hungry and had started ordering sandwiches so I had to say no once more to the manager! We felt extremely bad that the manager bent backwards to accommodate us and we could not come back as we were 20 minute walk away.<br><br>I can't speak highly enough for the service we received by the manager (can't remember her name). That was despite the fact that I got really upset with her for ruining our night with visiting relatives.<br><br>We know the food is amazing at this place. Now we can say the same thing for their service!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I found the food to be too salty.

It's definitely expensive - our meal ended up costing around $80/person after tax and tip. However, it's a fun atmosphere and the food was def worth the splurge. <br><br>We arrived around 5:00 on Saturday night and were seated immediately. There are a few communal tables as well as some lower, two seaters. We got sat at one of the two seaters near the restroom. It was a little tight - we were basically right up against the table next to us. But it ended up not being a problem. Like other reviewers mentioned, it's a pretty noisy restaurant. There were definitely moments when I felt like we were shouting at each other. Along with a slew of tapas, we ordered a half bottle of Chardonnay that our server suggested. A half bottle! What a great option for people who don't want to order an entire bottle (my aunt was driving home). <br><br>In terms of food items, the hits were: <br><br>Prosciutto-wrapped Guinea Hen - it's one of the pricier menu items (around $20), but it was so delicious. The meat was so tender and the flavor was bomb. <br><br>Milk braised pork shoulder - Yelp reviewers had raved about this dish, and they weren't wrong! It was by far the most delicious dish of the evening. So, so tender. Yum. <br><br>Manchego Cheese with Membrillo - this is basically just fried cheese. But oh my god, it was fantastic. Comes with a sweet jam, which was also delish. If you need something to round out your dinner, this is a great option. <br><br>There were also a few misses: <br><br>Burrata appetizer - this dish was just okay. When it comes to burrata, I prefer the traditional preparation (Big ball of burrata served with tomatoes and crunchy bread). I wasn't crazy about this version, which was stuffed in a cannoli. <br><br>Roasted bone marrow - this was another dish that received high marks on Yelp. Unfortunately, it was my least favorite dish of the night. I don't think bone marrow is for me - the texture and consistency was so slimy and oily.

It probably helped that we had 2 bottles of wine to keep us warm. Haha.<br><br>We had a variety of dishes to share amongst the 4 of us.<br><br>-Braised Artichokes with potatoes - not a fan. Hardly any artichokes. One bite and that was it.<br>-Bone marrow - I absolutely LOVE the bread that comes with it. The bone marrow was very soft and melts in your mouth. I HIGHLY recommend that you sprinkle a generous amount of the salt that they provide you or else it just tastes like fat and bread. The salt gives it some character. <br>-Pork shoulder - so tender, but a little bit too salty for me<br>-Prosciutto bread balls - nothing spectacular, but still tasty with the sauce on top.<br>-Pig jowl - I've never had this piece of the pig before, but I was surprised at how tender it was.<br>-Scallop spiedini - huge scallops! But pretty standard.<br>-Manila clams - one of my favorite dishes of the night. I ordered a side of bread just so that I could dip it in the juices. It had a kick to it, which I absolutely loved.<br>-Veal mortadella sausage - I was a little disappointed because I thought I was going to get a pounded piece of veal meat, but I didn't read the menu clear enough to see that it was a sausage! Either way, I liked the dish a lot. You had to put everything on top of the sausage! The cherry tomatoes were sweet and tart. Perfect.<br>-Prosciutto crusted cobia - I wish this dish was a bit bigger since we had to split it 4 ways. But it was a nice clean fish. <br>-Meatball sliders - this meatball is little bit bigger than a golf ball, so it was a little difficult to eat, but very delicious.<br>-Lemon pana cotta - probably, one of my favorite dishes. It was perfectly cool, smooth and silky with the lemon flavor while the crunchiness and saltiness of the pistachio gave it this great crunch. I want to look up a recipe and learn how to make it!<br>-Nutella panini - nothing spectacular. Just bread, nutella and banana together. I'd rather try their salted caramel ice cream!<br><br>All in all, we had a great time. The bill was about $300 including tip for 4 people. I wasn't as cold as I thought I was going to be.

He couldn't settle it until all of our food fired, but when he could, he did it very quickly. Very accommodating.<br>+ Our server was super friendly without being . . . y'know, overbearingly so.

No complaints here. I know from my hours of Yelping that it takes hours to get a seat and I was grateful for what I got, dang it! XD*** <br><br>Masticated on the much-Yelped-about items below: <br>- pig's ear and fried kale: dat fried egg, doe... Honestly, the saving grace of this dish. The perfectly runny egg yolk oozing over the fried pig ear and fried kale bits really helped cut down on the overall saltiness. I love egg~<br>- roasted bone marrow: I usually never eat bone marrow cuz I hate gelatinouos/mucosal textures, but... hey, when in Rome, right? (Or should I say \"when in Chicago...\") It was not bad, but I would never order it again. This was one of those one-and-done things. That being said, the nicely acidic side salad saved it. <br>- octopus: Derrrricious. Soft and refreshing to the palate, especially after eating the previous two dishes. Still salty. <br>- pork shoulder: I think I was pigged out by this point because I had absolutely no desire to finish this after taking a few bites. Soft as a baby's bottom, yes, but also pretty salty and almost nauseating with how rich the accompanying potatoes were. We took this home in a to-go bag and I toted it around with me for the rest of the day. The smell... well... let's just say I felt like I was holding a bag of congealed fart with me for hours on end. On the brighter side, it tasted fine when I heated it up the next day.<br><br>The Purple Pig knows how to balance its flavors (egg to cut out the salty; bright salad to cut out the slimy) but again, food doesn't taste as good when you have to pay an arm and a leg for it. This is definitely not the most I've ever spent on a meal, and I have walked out of restaurants feeling incredibly satisfied even after spending way too much, but for some reason, my experience at The Purple Pig did not justify the price tag that came with it. And the more time passed, the more annoyed I got at how expensive that meal was. Now THAT's not a good sign. <br><br>I'm glad I got to say I've eaten here before, but if I ever come back to Chicago, this place will not be on my list of places to come back to.

She ignored us right away and did not attend to us for at lease 12 minutes and then when we had ordered she forgot to send it in!

With some downtime to myself, in between the normal lunch and dinner peaks, I figured then was as good as ever of a time to try and grab a seat at the bar and treat myself (it was my half birthday after all!).  Arriving just before 4PM on a Saturday, I had to wait about 15 minutes before a seat at the bar opened up, which I quickly snatched up, eagerly awaiting my meal.<br><br>My experience from the perspective of the food itself straddled between great and really great, depending on the dish.  I started with the fried brussels sprouts, which were highly addictive and I would immediately order again.  The texture and crunch-level to which they were fried was absolutely perfect.  <br><br>The next dish, the calamari offered a nice contrast to the sprouts, with a rich palette of flavors in every bite stemming from the calamari itself, along with the radishes, cucumbers, and pistachios; however, compared to each of the other dishes I had, this one did not stand out as much.  Many of the dishes on the menu (at least, in theory, as I only tried four total), have bold, stand-out flavors; while the calamari was certainly not flavorless by any means, it was overshadowed and a bit out of context with my other choices.<br><br>I had originally ordered the bone marrow, but decided to nix that and not fall victim to my eyes being larger than my stomach.  Due to the frequent mention of the dish in other reviews, I fully intended on having it; however, I must note that this dish seems to have changed recently (it is not even reflected on the website) and is a much larger portion (which comes along with an increase in price).<br><br>My final dish (until I was easily convinced into a dessert) was the PLT, the Purple Pig's interpretation of a jowl-based BLT.  Given the heavy focus on the use of all parts pig, I wanted to try at least one dish that starred the animal, and ended up here.  In my opinion, the spread (which I cannot remember exactly of what it consisted) slightly overshadowed the star of the show (i.e.; the pork jowl) and threw the balance of the dish slightly.  There were certainly bites were everything meshed quite well, but more often than not I found my taste buds fighting their way through the spread to find the other flavors in the open-faced style sandwich.<br><br>I never expected to have dessert, but the small amount of room I had from skipping the bone marrow coupled with a recent craving for mousse that stems from who knows where led me to order one last dish.  Don't quote me on certain parts of this description, as I can't seem to verify the exact ingredients anywhere, but this recent addition to the menu features a chocolate mousse atop a hazelnut crust, topped itself with a cherry (if I'm remembering correctly) Sicilian-style granita (or something similar) and a sprinkle of pomegranate seeds.  The dish was a perfect ending to the meal, with my only wish being a slightly larger emphasis on the hazelnut crust.<br><br>I was fortunate enough to seat myself at the farthest stool at the back of the bar which luckily comes with a perfect view of the action in the kitchen.  Being able to marvel at the chefs working frantically to meet the onslaught of dish requests was worth the price of admission alone, especially for a budding foodie like myself, the food seeming like an added bonus at times.  While I've always envied chefs across the globe, this experience truly made me appreciate their art, while simultaneously realize that I wouldn't survive ten minutes in a professional cooking environment without being hospitalized by a panic attack.<br><br>A few other brief notes: <br><br>-The wine selection is quite extensive and the highlight of an otherwise more-than-adequate bar.<br>-The servers and waitstaff are as efficient as the rest of the establishment, which may come off as a bit unfriendly at times, but it is just the pace the restaurant demands; however, they are very helpful with recommendations and knowledgeable about the menu when asked.<br>-The prices were extremely reasonable in my opinion.  Compared to similar restaurants in New York, the prices were lower and the portions larger.<br><br>I hope I get the opportunity to come back to the Purple Pig next I'm in Chicago and can explore the menu a bit further (hopefully with more people, as more people means more dishes to share).  While I may have been slightly disappointed with some of my personal choices, the food is still quite excellent and worth multiple visits.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Good food and service.

I would recommend sharing though, there's just too much on the menu to focus all on a couple things!  I totally wish we could come back and try more.  <br><br>Brussell Sprouts= YES!

Not that it tasted bad or anything, it was actually good, but I don't think it was quite the \"MAGIC in your mouth\" feeling my roomie described.  It tasted a bit like fat cells spread out on some magical bread with salt and onions and cilantro,  It wasn't a bad combo but.meh. and DON'T SMELL THE BONE WHATEVER YOU DO! lol it will definitely ruin it. 4/5<br><br>These four came out to about $55 so not your regular lunch price, but perfect for date night or a quick nice lunch stop.  Also you'd probably have to spend a little bit more to be completely full, but we were satisfied.

Too long.  This past weekend, we cleared our schedules and prepared to wait. We put our names on the list around 6 pm and were told the wait was 45 minutes.  We only ended up waiting 30 minutes instead! Way to set the bar low and then overdeliver :).  When we were on our way back in, however, I overheard the hostess tell people that the wait was 2 hours again.  So. Come early unless you feel like waiting until 9 or 10 to eat dinner.<br><br>Onto the food. Just wow. My boyfriend and I got the octopus, the bone marrow, the milk-braised pork shoulder and the turkey leg (a very protein-heavy meal, yes, this is what happens when you allow your carnivorous boyfriend to pick all the dishes. no regrets though). Everything was amazing.  The octopus was so unique-- I'd never had octopus cooked like this before! The meat was cooked so perfectly- chewy without being springy and tough. It was lightly flavored with what I'm guessing is butter and lemon... damn. And it was light-- perfect that it came out as our first dish!  The bone marrow came next. This one is more fun than anything-- you get a plate with three huge bones on it, with a gelatinous, fatty looking paste in the center of each (for those like me who have never had it before!).  It comes with some grilled bread, a little dish of salt and a mixture of parsley, capers and other spices to put on top. We spread the bone marrow onto the bread like butter (except there is so much bone marrow that we slathered it on) and then sprinkled salt and spices on top.  Tastes good.  I would definitely recommend ordering it to have a fun new food experience, but I don't think I would get it again-- there are better things to be eaten at the Purple Pig! Next was the milk-braised pork shoulder; it's so tender that they serve it with a spoon! The mashed potatoes that come with it is more like a creamy soup that covers the bottom of the dish.  Next was the real star of the show: the turkey leg. Who even knew that turkey's were that humongous? The leg was gigantic... there was so much meat! It was fall-of-the-bone tender and was served with an amazing tangy sauce and vegetables.  If only Thanksgiving turkeys tasted like this.  <br><br>My boyfriend told me at the end of the meal that this was his favorite restaurant we've been to so far in Chicago. We go out to eat all the time, so this is a huge statement.  After the entrees we had a peanut butter semifreddo and a fried brioche roll with ricotta and nutella in the middle.  It was the perfect end to a perfect meal.  A Chicago must-try!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Lunch Time on a Beautiful Monday afternoon with no wait time.  I was seated promptly within minutes of asking for a table for 2. <br><br>Service was exceptional.  Food portions were perfect since most of the plates I ordered were on the richer side.  I ordered the Milk Braised shoulder, crispy pig's ears and the simple kale caesar salad.  Please note if you don't like your salad to be drenched in dressing, tell them to put it on the side.<br><br>Overall, I would definitely recommend The Purple Pig for lunch.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "We flew in on a 6am weekday flight from NYC and are staying with a friend who lives 5 blocks away.  I yelped a restaurant for lunch.  Giiven our fatigue and hunger....this was a great yelp reviewed spot to follow up on.  Upon arriving 7 min prior to opening, there were already 10-15 pp waiting for doors to open.  The staff was amazing and efficient.  Though all the food came quickly...we did not feel rushed.  The communal seating allowed us to talk with others at our table, which we enjoyed as visiting outsiders.  Food was amazing!!!  We had the bone marrow, foie grais torchon, hot dog, pork shoulder, and the JLT...all amazing. !!!  Would definitely recommend to anyone who likes pork and wine!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Seriously F-ing Awesome!!!

So, we talked to the waiter and asked again if there was anything I could eat. He said most food was cooked on the same grill as the bread but it wouldn't be any different than kissing my husband after drinking a beer. I said I didn't do that and he rolled his eyes but said in that case the only thing that might be safe was the turkey leg. <br>I get that when you are busy a food allergy can be the bane of a waiter's night but our cups were refilled only once, the small plates came out one at a time and about 30 minutes apart.

Anyway, If you are not a fan of food with too much fat, stay away from ordering the bone marrow. <br><br>2nd dish, fried pig ear(can't recall the exact name)? Prob give it a three star. Too crispy to tell the ingredient were pig ears. My own philosophy is that if u can't tell what the food is made from and it has only an OK taste, then trying once is enough. I do like the hint of sour combined with the oily crispy things. You know, it just makes the dish taste so much fresher! <br><br>3rd dish, an egg with some salad? Lol I can't recall. It did not surprise me at all. So that's it. <br><br>Finally comes to the dishes I DO enjoy, turkey leg and pig shoulder with smashed potatoes!!!! The best!!!!! They are the must try! I finished them all cuz my friend could barely eat a thing after he finished one bone marrow. Lol! <br><br>Go early on Friday. We went there around 6 and waited an hour and fifteen minutes to get seated.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "My first time in Chicago and found this place looking for a restaurant close to the Art Institute. I love a wine bar and I was not disappointed. I found a seat at the bar and the bartender, Caesar, was very knowledgeable. He found me a wine off the extensive menu that was directly to my tastes and something I would've probably never tried myself, a Croatian wine, which was so good I'm going to have to try more of them! The food was excellent. The beets with whipped goat cheese was probably the most amazing thing I've ate in awhile. The half dozen raw oysters I felt were reasonably priced for PEI oysters were fresh and sweet and small cupped. Absolutely delicious. I was debating on another plate when I was told of the special, beef tenderloin, and beef cheek pie with spinach ice cream. It was gastronomic heaven.

I came here by myself which was one of my biggest mistakes as you really cant get a good grasp on what a meal at this place should be like without being able to try at least 3 dishes (there were at least 12 things I WISH I could have tried). Its actually a very small and cramped dining room which I found surprising considering that tapas are really meant to be enjoyed in groups.   <br><br>The place was packed on a Sunday so I sat at the bar and the service was busy but attentive.  They have a great wine list and very select but quality draft menu.  I ordered 4 plates. The Greek corn bread was easy but amazing (enough said). The buratta was tasty, but for me the cardinal sin of a failed buratta dish is altering the nature of a perfectly decent, squishy buratta.  It was foamed in this dish, which isn't wrong by any means, just totally unnecessary.  I was a little dissapointed despite it being one of my overall favorites. Next I had the foie gras, which was beautiful to look at, and adorned with a plethora of interesting ingredients (like cherries, balsamic, and baby corn), but overall the foie gras itself was hidden behind all these other over powering accompaniments. It was a gorgeous dish, but lacking a cohesion, and perhaps it would benefit from a simplification to highlight the actual meat of the dish.  Last I had the taramosalata which is one of my all time favorite Greek delicacies (a creamy fish roe salad). Traditionally its a very simply prepared dish, but deceptively complex in flavor.  Again, it looked gorgeous, but lacking in traditional flavor and overpowered by vinegar.  It was just not a necessary reinvention. The vinegar here, although not bad, overpowered the subtle flavor of the roe itself so it just tasted unwelcoming.  Not bad mind you, just needed a little simplification. <br><br>And so that's it.  Usually my beef with tapas restaurants is that they have too much on the menu, and needs to be simplified. And here I don't think they need to simplify the menu, but perhaps the dishes themselves.  Or perhaps I just ordered wrong and picked the wring plates in the luck of the draw.  I didn't get any meat dishes or any la plancha which is probably my critical error.  I came in here wanting to be blown away, and I WAS, but also a little overwhelmed in an underwhelming way (does that make sense?). Do you see why I need to come back to try again? Like poker, maybe if I traded in two cards of the hand, the meal would have been a flush and not a scattering of random cards.  I give this place a 4.5 rounded down because why, oh why would you foam buratta!?
