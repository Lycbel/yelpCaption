When we got to the restaurant they were giving out 2 hour wait times to walk-ins like they were Oprah. You get a 2 hour wait, You get a 2 hour wait, and you get a 2 hour wait. There is metered street parking right around the corner from the restaurant. <br><br>The staff there was very friendly. They were very apologetic about the wait and very attentive to my group's needs. The food was not only picture perfect, but also delicious. There are so many good sounding options to choose from and I got the strawberry almond french toast, bacon and corned beef hash. MMMMMM!!! My entire group loved their meal.

The Barbacoa was flavorful, but some bites were EXTREMELY spicy. They may have unevenly spread the spices and it became a bit unbearable to eat without taking water breaks. The Garden skillet, however, was entirely opposite. I'm talking NO spices what so ever. It left me extremely confused... they were sautéed veggies with an egg on top. That's quite literally it.

My mouth is literally watering as I type this review. So... if you like blueberries, cream cheese, and pancakes. Order this. <br><br>Oreo Pancake - 8.5<br>Very good, super sweet.

I wouldn't even think that's a realistic expectation and it seems the standard here. If you're blessed to dine here, you've probably already been waiting at least 30 minutes and are starving (they give you menus in line too if you're interested which is cool so you can order right when you sit down). With food this good and a place this busy, you'd probably let bad service slide but nope!!

I signaled for my check before she was planning to bring it to me.<br><br>It's really nice that they are properly staffed: to keep service moving, clear plates to make space on crowded tables in big parties where people might want to order more (look at the pics of menu items & think about the volume of dishes that place must wash in 30 minutes), to make sure no customer gets overlooked(!!)or has a bad experience, and flip tables efficiently so you know that waitlist is not falsely longer than it really needs to be(important!!!). Take away a single busboy, or a server, or a line cook, and suddenly people are waiting on their drinks and their checks instead of seeing tourist sites bc their server is also clearing tables, and that waitlist gets longer unnecessarily, and you're losing customers and customer satisfaction. Seriously, who hates on great service? <br><br>Personally, I think that's a sign of a great establishment that knows what it's doing and does it well.

I had the signature berry bliss ($13) and my bf has the butcher skillet ($14). The signature berry bliss came with five stacks of pancakes drizzled with fruity glaze. There was also an arrangement of fruits on the side, such as blackberries, strawberries and blueberries. The portions were huge and I think I only ate 3/5s of the pancakes but devoured all the fruit. The butcher skillet came with cheese, eggs, hash browns, and meat. My bf liked that it was served still in the pan. The butcher skillet came with a side of two pancakes too!

It was still packed at 7 am for a weekday!<br><br>The food and the service is fantastic. They are very professional and fast. My Dad and I ordered Cafe latte and Hazelnut latte for ourselves. The drinks came out quickly while we were still deciding the food.<br>Here is what we ordered -<br>** Napa Valley fig Omelette with a side of Pancakes - Egg omelette with figs, bacon and cheese. This is my first time tasting figs in an omelette and I should say, it was pretty interesting and I liked it. I got a bowl of fruit on the side.<br>I ordered the entree and upgraded to the specialty pancakes (2 stacks), their much talked about Signature Berry Bliss Pancakes. Considering how much I love pancakes, this was heaven to me!! Definitely order this when you are here!<br>Pro tip #2 - Don't forget to order Signature Berry Bliss pancakes!<br><br>**Southern Benedict - Poached eggs with biscuits and gravy. It comes with a side of Hash Browns.<br><br>No regrets and no complaints.

Not only are the famous berry bliss pancakes truly blissful; all the brunch items are unique, Insta-worthy, and so delicious you'll find yourself surprised at your appetite.<br><br>The SIGNATURE BERRY BLISS PANCAKES ($13) is a heavenly combination of sweet and creamy with vanilla Anglaise, blackberry coulis, berry mascarpone, and fresh berries over what is arguably the fluffiest pancakes I've ever had.<br><br>The STRAWBERRY LEMON BUTTERCREAM FRENCH TOAST ($13) was comprised of thick slabs of brioche with the same magically airy texture as the pancakes. I liked how it wasn't too sweet and creamy, and you notice the slight eggy taste of the brioche bread base. I think I would have liked the surface to be a little crispy and not all softness, but that is just personal French toast preference.<br><br>For something hearty, the SLOW ROAST BRISKET HASH ($14) is delicious. It's a bit of a kitchen sink with all the guilty pleasures of breakfast combined, including brisket, eggs, roasted red peppers, onions, and hash browns all blended together under a savory sausage gravy. The portion of brisket was generous, and it reminded me of barbacoa because it wasn't too dry. I do like their hash browns, which taste quite homemade as thick strips of potatoes. I think I prefer it the way it is rather than deep fried, because it blends in with the other ingredients better (and is not as dehydrated).<br><br>It's hard to pass up on the skillets since the presentation is so aesthetically pleasing in a steal skillet and the portions were huuuggggee! I was a fan of the DENVER SKILLET ($12) with hash browns, cheddar and jack cheese, eggs, ham, bell peppers, and onions. There was an ample amount of thick cut chunks of ham, and it did taste more smokey and high-quality than your typical breakfast ham. In my opinion it could be lighter on the cheese, because the dish was heavy enough it it was.<br><br>Wildberry's interior is spacious and well lit (an important consideration for food pictures). There are decorations of the Wildberry stem on the walls, and the lighting is trendy with light bulbs encased in spherical globes. Service is efficient as well. I enjoyed our visit to Wildberry so much, I asked boo if we could come back here on the last day of our Chicago trip so that we can try more things :3<br><br>Pro tips: <br>- Most entrees come with either toast or pancakes. While the toast is decent (choice of wheat, white, sourdough, or rye), it makes the most sense portion-wise and price-wise to get the pancakes. A regular order comes with 5 pancakes and the side order has 2, and you can upgrade to any of the specialty pancakes for an extra $1.50. One entree + the side of  special pancakes is perfect for two people and avoids the problem of soggy brunch leftovers.<br>- The place is big, but the wait can be long even on weekdays. I suggest arriving by 9-9:30 for minimal wait time. They don't take reservations, and you have to be present to put your name down.<br>- Several of the pancakes flavors are also available as French toast or waffles if that is your breakfast carb of choice.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dxMY-Wp8SvR7ZHGCeKFfKw/348s.jpg", "caption": "Wildberry for brunch"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7Mx_Svbla3FqdG0vP97bMg/168s.jpg", "caption": "The spread P:"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_nMESjytTA-HKpCbw3KqTg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Lemon buttercream French toast ($13)"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Excellent place for breakfast.

While Wildberry was very good I have to be honest, it didn't stand out among many of the other brunch places I've been to. Yes it was good, but the pancakes are not made of gold. Don't go in with your expectations too high, because you'll definitely be left wondering, \"Why?\"<br><br>We visited Wildberry when visiting Chicago a few weeks ago. When I saw the incredible amount of reviews on Yelp I thought it was a must. Thank goodness we planned ahead and I put our name in on Yelp as soon as I woke up that Sunday morning.

NOT worth a 2+ hour wait!!! Don't do that to yourself!<br><br>We were sat at a small table toward the back of the restaurant. Our waitress was quick to get us some drinks (I had their cherry lemonade... very good!) while we reviewed the menu. We noticed really quickly that the people around us had HUGE portions (and the prices were not cheap!), so we asked our waitress if she'd mind if we shared a meal. I hated doing that since they were so busy but our waitress was super nice about it. We ordered the garden skillet plus sausage with signature berry bliss pancakes, and a side of bacon. Definitely more than enough food for two even though it was only one entree and a side. I still didn't even finish my half of the skillet!<br><br>The food came out in good time and was very good. I expected the pancakes to have this heavy, super sweet icing on them, but it was more of a yogurt topping. They were excellent. We also found a bite of pancakes that didn't have any fruit or topping on it so we could try what just their plain pancakes would taste like. That was even better! Overall it was a very good meal that ended up costing somewhere around $40. Thank goodness we didn't spend double that and end up with a ton of leftovers that would just be thrown away or I would've been pretty disappointed.<br><br>Overall I'd say Wildberry is worth a visit, but as I said before - make a reservation and expect a great but not quite life-changing meal.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oRGGURFatV8JxJI5Wpccrw/348s.jpg", "caption": "Garden skillet with added sausage, signature berry bliss pancakes, and a side of bacon"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Great breakfast spot.  Gets really busy at 9am so prepare to wait or get there early.

The yogurt topping is a nice unique addition, and the berries are fresh.

Hour to hour and 45 minute wait. Nope! Are else where. The next morning (Saturday) I realized you are able to add to the wait list through yelp! It tells you how the wait and to check in when you actually do reach the restaurant. Got to use this method! Upon my check in, I'm told I still have a little wait, but no problem. As I'm waiting for maybe 3 minutes, a waiter tells me he can seat me! I followed the other waiter who gave me a perfect corner outdoor seat.

I got the corned beef hash with a side of s'mores pancakes. Both were amazing!!! The corned beef had a layer of cheese and eggs on top, and it was crunchy from being baked after prepared. The only thing that could have made it better was to use half the amount of hash browns in it. It's so much food you'd get full before finishing it! The s'mores pancakes were so delicious.

But a fair warning, they are pretty sweet and not for people who cannot handle the sugar. The signature berry bliss pancakes had layerings of berry mascarpone which I enjoyed. The corned beef hash skillet was enormous and the picture does not do it justice. With both the pancakes and the skillet, I could only finish about a third of my food and I have a pretty big appetite. I spent about $16 here but it is worth it for a decent brunch place. The only thing I did not like about my experience here was how close in proximity the tables were to each other.

This is probably the only thing that I recommend not to get. The corned beef was pretty much flavorless and there was way too many potatoes in it. Also, the chipotle hollandaise had a strange flavor to me. Didn't really taste like chipotle at all, but rather some weird spices. However, their hashbrowns were on point! Super crispy on the outside and fully cooked and fluffy on the inside. Just the way hashbrowns should be cooked. My wife ordered their Asian chicken salad and that was great, a lot of toppings and great flavor all around. We did split an order of their famous wildberry pancakces. They are good, but they are very sweet so keep that in mind. Almost was like a dessert for breakfast. Last but not least, their biscuits and gravy were amazing.

We had never had anything there, and everything on the menu sounded amazing. So we both settled with a skillet and side of pancakes, because why not?!

Average weekend wait time for a party of 2-4 for me has been 1.5 to 3 hours. However, what many people don't know is that you don't have to wait physically at the door. They are on this app called NoWait and you can put your name in the queue directly there. It tells you an expected wait time and how many parties are in front of you, in real time. Then they'll text you when the table is ready and you have 5 minutes to check in with the hostess to claim your spot. In my experience, the wait time the app predicts has always been longer than actual so prepare to get there a bit earlier than said ETA. What's a bit annoying, and the main reason I'm not giving it 5 stars, is that after you check in, you still have to wait at the door for another 10ish minutes to actually get seated.

Hashbrown was a bit salty for my taste, but I am a ketchup girl so the saltiness went down with ketchup. The Fresca with chicken sausage is their egg omelet, it was okay, nothing too special or surprising.<br><br>Signature Berry Bliss Pancake - I like the freshness of the fruits and the fluffiness of the pancake. <br><br>Espanola - taste like burrito. <br><br>Chocolate Chip Banana Pancake - overload with a sweetness which I don't mind, but I prefer the Berry Bliss.<br><br>Hazelnut Latte - Surprisingly okay, but the espresso was not that strong, probably I should ask for a double shot if it's allowed.<br><br>Place - Pretty generic, nothing special in terms of decoration and interior. It was small and easily get crowded.<br><br>Serving size - Huge serving size.

The restaurant was bigger than expected and service was quick and friendly. After sampling around the menu, we decided on the Florence Benedict and their Signature Berry Bliss Pancakes. <br><br>Now, I love pancakes so it's a big deal when I say these pancakes were the best I've ever had. First of all, the order came in a stack of 5 so definitely share with someone! It was fluffy and every bite was just melt in your mouth good. Though it looks like a lot going on with glazes on top, the pancakes were not overly sweet at all. Cut a piece of your pancake, run it over some vanilla anglaise on the plate, add a little syrup, and I swear it's simply bliss. The berry mascarpone spread in between the pancakes were divine as it was creamy and complimented the pancakes and fresh fruit well. <br><br>The pancakes were definitely the star of the show, but the Florence Benedict was equally just as good. I'm not a big fan of benedicts in general, but this dish was bomb! A lot of breakfast joints usually make their hollandaise sauce pretty thick, but Wildberry makes it light and you definitely don't get tired of it. You know that feeling when you eat something that's too heavy and after a few bites you get sick of it? Not this one! This was perfect. It was a simple benedict with english muffin, a poached egg, with bacon and spinach on top; yet it was so good and definitely a memorable dish. It came with a side of hash browns that were also nice and crispy. <br><br>Another cool thing is they have an Intelligentsia Coffee bar to the right as you walk in! You can order coffee at the table and they'll serve it to you. I was super excited about this since it's on my list of places to try while in Chicago, but since I had already gotten my coffee fix for the morning, I didn't end up getting any. But, nice to know there's one right inside this restaurant! <br><br>Overall, I had such a pleasant experience here and it's quite honestly at the #1 top of my list for breakfast joints.

The hash browns were crispy on the outside which I love. My friend loved his butcher block - they had VERY generous amounts of meat and he said all the meats were great and so was the chorizo. <br><br>The Oreo s'more pancake was a little too sweet for me but it was a great dessert option!

We got the Los Altos Benedict and Signature Berry Bliss french toast to get a good mix of sweet and savory. Both were SO GOOD, but definitely recommend splitting with friends if you get the Berry Bliss, because the sweetness can be overwhelming if you try to eat the whole thing. It came with a generous topping of berries, which is always appreciated. The Los Altos was SUPER delicious - we both agreed it was the star of the show. The chorizo sausage went so well with their hollandaise sauce, it was like an explosion of flavor in my mouth. If you're really sensitive to spicy foods, consider getting the hollandaise  and pico de gallo on the side. Excellent portions too. I also tried the kiwi lemonade which was a little too sweet at first, but once diluted with water was really tasty.

I was visiting a friend in Chicago who raved about this place. Seeing how this place is very popular on Yelp, I had high expectations especially when it comes to breakfast places but didn't think a breakfast place would be SO GOOD that I really wanted to come back 2 days later. <br><br>The place is located at a prime spot in Chicago- close to the free Cultural Center and Millennium Park. There's lots of seating inside the restaurant and some seating outside. It's easier to seat parties of 2-4 at this place as most of the tables were around that size but you can definitely come here in a large group if you don't mind waiting a little longer.<br><br>As for the wait, you can add your name on the waiting list through the \"Nowait\" app rather than going there to put your name down. Both times I went, me and a friend would add our names through the app and would just walk around in the area. We came here on a Tuesday and Thursday at around 10:30-11amish and waited around 40 minutes. Just a heads up that the \"Nowait\" app will only allow you to put down up to a party of 4 on their app. You can also order coffee and other drinks from Intelligentsia inside by the entrance while you wait. The wait goes by pretty quick and they do a really good job with service. For example, there was 65 parties ahead of us while we were waiting- pretty impressive for a 40 minute wait if you asked me! <br><br>For the food, they offer standard breakfast food such as omelettes, Egg Benedict, pancakes, egg skillets, waffles, etc. What I love about this place is how you can get an omelette (which comes with hashbrowns and/or fruit AND sub the toast for one of their specialty pancakes for just $1.50 more. Both times I came, I've gotten an omelette with hash browns and specialty pancakes. For my first visit, I got their Napa Valley Fig omelette with hash browns and Banna Cream Pie omelette. During my second visit, I created my own omelette (I put figs, spinach, mushrooms, and sausage in my omelette) with hash browns and paired it with their \"Berry Bliss\" pancakes. At a glance, it's a lot of food- the omelette and hash browns fill up a giant plate while the pancakes come in a stack of 2. But the food is so good that if you're like me who can't resist a hearty breakfast, you will finish the entire meal. Their omelettes are huge and they don't skimp out on their toppings. For their Napa Valley Fig omelette, I was surprised by how well the sweetness of the figs worked will with the other savory toppings. Their hash browns are nice and crispy on the top and were cooked just like how any good hash browns at a classic breakfast place should be. As for their pancakes... oh my goodness THEY ARE SO FLUFFY. I'm not the biggest pancake person but when I had their pancakes, I couldn't stop eating them (no joke). Both Banana Cream Pie and Berry Bliss were super delicious without being overly sweet. I will admit though, when I first read how their Berry Bliss pancakes were one of their more \"special\" or \"must-try\"  ones, I was feeling a little \"eh\" because they were just pancakes but after trying them during my first visit, I can see why people rave about them. The berry and vanilla sauce and toppings that they drizzle on top had a mix of fresh, creamy and candylike taste, giving the \"Bliss\" part to the name some credibility. <br><br>Service was excellent both times that I visited. Once we got seated, they served us water right away and when we needed something, they gave it to us quickly. Everyone was also friendly and calm as well- which surprises me since the place is really busy. Food also came out in a jiffy as well. Each time I visited, I paid around maybe $15-17 including tax and tip (Note: I was feeling a little bit more generous when it came to tipping because I personally was impressed with how my experience went).

When the fries came out they appeared to have a batter on them so we flagged down another person on the wait staff.

The restaurant was clean, the customer service was good, and the food was superb! I went around noon on a Tuesday morning and there was no wait. We were immediately seated when we walked in. There is so much to choose from on the menu. I ordered the raspberry lemonade,  Venetian skillet, with a side of their \"Signature Berry Bliss\" pancakes. Everything was so delicious!!!! The lemonade wasn't all tart and bitter like some places make it. The skillet was yummy, though I did have to add some ketchup because it seemed like it was missing a sauce. My coworkers added hollandaise and they seemed to be pleased with that. The pancakes were so warm, soft, and fluffy!!! The berry bliss pancakes weren't too sweet and the berries were fresh. I didn't even need to add syrup to them! I would definitely recommend eating at Wildberry for Breakfast or brunch. It's located right across the street from Millenium Park so you'll definitely have to go walk it off when you are done eating.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lfGsxRGOUTZOxZAFMW41dQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "\"Signature Berry Bliss\" Pancakes"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uo1_wxET9cBxqjhLOIlSeA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Yummy!

Within a minute I got a text letting me know to check-in, so went back inside to the desk to clarify we had done so - if you don't check in by the directed time you lose your place. It turns out it was actually the text to let us know our table was ready - holler! They sent me back outside to grab my boyfriend and then we were seated. A little confusing, but overall easy-peasy compared to the hot mess of waiting two hours outside in the Chicago winter. <br><br>I decided to embrace the photogenic namesake dish, the Signature Berry Bliss pancakes - vanilla anglaise, blackberry coulis, berry mascarpone, and a mix of fresh strawberries, blackberries, and blueberries. There were several other amazing dessert-like options that called my name but I wanted to pretend I was eating something remotely healthy to balance the other indulgences of our weekend. <br><br>The pancakes were fluffy and the plate was large - you won't go hungry if you order this dish.

I ended up getting out earlier so I walked over to put my name in. The hostess was not friendly but I assumed it was for efficiency sake. I told her, \"Cristina for 2 people and we'd like to sit outside.\" She looked dazed so I repeated myself, \"Cristina C R I S TI N A without the H.\" She was dismissive about that and told me it would be a 45 minute wait. I asked her if it was for outside seating and she looked annoyed and said yes. This whole interaction could not have taken more than a minute. I didn't take offense. I was in a celebratory mood, the weather was gorgeous, my project just ended and it was my friend's birthday. <br><br>Fast forward 40ish minutes later, our table was ready so I checked in--again unfriendly service. This hostess (a different one) cut me off before I could even finish saying \"Cristina table for 2\" with \"yeah we'll call out your name.\" By this time, I was like okaaaaay, damn. Not even five minutes later, another host (the 3rd one) was calling out, \"China for 2, China for 2.\" I ignored him--because that's not my name. But all three of them were looking at us and finally, my friend was like I think they mean you lol. Alright, sure--- this has never happened to me before but whatever. This host proceeded to seat us inside and I was like, no I specifically asked to sit outside. He gets mad and barks, \"you're going to have to wait longer so do you want this table or not? If you want to sit outside, you'll wait longer.\" I told him we already waited 45 minutes and he repeated himself about waiting longer. I was weirded out by his aggressiveness so I turned to my friend and she's like yeah we'll wait. <br><br>We walk back to the desk. By this time, I'm annoyed so I talked to the hostesses and I told them I specifically asked to sit outside and how long is the wait. The dazed one just looked at me blankly and the one who cut me off before glared at me and snapped \"you'll get the first available table.\" As I'm writing this, I really have no idea why I didn't hulk out hahah. I hate rude people--there is absolutely no excuse for rude behavior especially when you are in the service industry. <br><br>We finally got our table--and our server Natalie was great. Our food was delicious--with enormous portions. We ordered the Mexicana skillet, the Fresca omelet (on Natalie's recommendation) and a side of the cinnamon roll pancakes (on the recommendation of the table next to us).

Came in on a Thursday around 1. It was packed, but we were seated after 15 minutes. I ordered the chocolate banana bread French toast. I took one bite and fell in love. The bread nice and warm, filled with chocolate galore inside and drizzled on top. Additionally, I also got hash browns on the side. Had a nice mix of crispy and soft, and weren't too salty. You can't go wrong with hash browns! My friend got some pancakes, so I had a bite and they were nice and fluffy, like clouds in your mouth.  I'd probably order some the next time I went.<br><br>On top of delicious food, the service is great! Our waitress came to tell us about the food, gave recommendations and came a good amount of times to ask how we were doing.  I'LL BE BACK, WILDBERRY!!<br><br>***<br>So I came back. My rating stays the same, but I do want to mention new items I tried and some employees. After getting called to get seated, they seated our party of 3 at a table for six right by the door in the back, which had air rushing in, when I say this it's not a nice breeze....MY CONTACTS WERE DRYING UP. The hostess seated us and we noticed this and asked if she could close the door, she responded by telling us that she wasn't sure so she would go ask the manager. Seemed like she had asked a manager and they said no, but instead of coming to tell us, she avoided us. She could have easily came over and told us, so we wouldn't have to ask other employees. We ended up asking our waitress and her initial response was the same, that she would go and ask. She promptly came back and told us she couldn't, so we asked to be reseated. At this point, the hostess that had seated us seemed very annoyed, letting out a sigh. HOWEVER, a kind employee, Nino reseated us within minutes, and got our drinks out right away. He apologized and sent another waiter our way to take our orders. He is a model and star employee. <br><br>It gets better. While sitting and waiting for our orders to come, the same hostess that had seated us was seating another table. They were a party of 4 but only 3 of them were there. I'm not entirely sure about Wildberry's policy on seating and having to have your entire party there, but as the hostess when you are seating people and you know how many people are in their party, you should tell them that. She could have simply asked before seating them, is your entire party here? Instead, after the three of them were sitting already, she said oh you can't sit, not everyone is here. This isn't something you tell them AFTER they are already sitting down looking at their menus. She didn't even have the patience to explain further and ended up pulling another employee to explain to them. <br><br>Okay leaving these employee stories behind, I ordered the fresh berries french toast, which was simple but delightful. The berries were indeed fresh and the french toast was nice and fluffy. I also tried some of my friends signature berry bliss pancakes, which you can't go wrong with. Their pancakes are some of the best I've ever had.

I also recommend, grabbing one of Wildberry's coffee to go before you head out. They have a good selection. <br><br>It was SO nice finally being able to sit down inside after spending time outside in the elements of chilly Chicago. Service was quick thankfully too. We instantly knew we were getting their Berry Bliss pancakes (duh), but my advice is to get these as a side with another entree. It's only a $1.50 more and you get two yummy and fluffy pancakes which is more than enough to fill you up. Plus you can try other entrees instead of filling yourself up on just pancakes. I opted for the Brisket Hash. This was quite hardy, but delicious. The brisket was moist and the gravy was thick and yummy. The pancakes were - without question - BOMB and were a delight. So much fluffy goodness with not too much sweet drizzled on top. I also thought it was nice how they had fresh strawberries and blackberries on the side as a light and refreshing snack.<br><br>For a single visit, I'd say we were extremely satisfied!

Shoutout to Yelp for the \"Waitlist\" feature within its app for certain restaurants- I was able to join the waitlist from home and then just arrived at the time indicated on the app. It was amazing because it saved me a lot of frustration from having to wait in line or wait in the hot sun. The only complaint I have regarding this matter is, I had specifically asked to be seated outside when I made my waitlist request and when the waiter called and headed towards seating us inside, I was like wait a second and pulled out my app to show him I specifically asked to be seated outside. He was like it'll be another 20 minute wait- if I indicated an hour and a half prior to that I wanted to sit outside, it's rather unreasonable to tell me your table is up next and then get seated indoors. He could tell my frustration and reassured me that I would be seated shortly. It was less than 10 mins later that we were seated outside. The reason I was such a witch about sitting outside is because there is a large difference in the noise level. It is so noisy inside that you can barely talk but much quieter and calmer on the patio. One thing I didn't like about sitting on the patio is that there was one waitress covering the patio area which I think has about seven tables but she also has assistance from a bus guy. The thing is, the bus boy was more attentive and kind enough to respond to our requests because our waitress was too busy catering to the needs of her other customers. I don't hold that against her but keep in mind that there are more people with parties of +4 than two so if you have one waitress that has seven tables and four out of the seven tables have plus four people, it's unreasonable to expect that the waitress has the capacity to get every persons request in. We didn't wait long to have our order taken, my friend ordered an iced latte and she ordered the garden skillet and I ordered the Napa Valley Fig omelette. The omelette contains California eggs, figs, havarti cheese and bacon served with either hash browns or fruit and a choice of pancakes or toast. I don't eat pork so I asked the waitress to substitute for turkey bacon. I also decided to switch out the toast for the specialty pancakes- the Wildberry berry which cost an additional $1.15. My friends coffee arrived rather quickly and she was a little annoyed that it was served in a plastic cup as opposed to a mug. I'm sure it's more convenient for people to be able to take it to go later on. We waited about ten minutes for our order. The portions are rather large, you could eat it all by yourself or you can eat half and take the rest home. The omelette was good but the figs were a little tasteless and dry but I think that's because they were too scorched in the sun from drying. I'm European and Ive literally picked figs off of a tree so I know how sweet the have the capacity to be. Go a little easier on cooking the figs. I think having the real bacon as opposed to the turkey bacon makes a huge difference because figs tend to be sweet and a smoked flavor balances out the sweetness. I loved the turkey bacon but it lacked the smokiness that is essential to making this omelette delicious! The hash browns I ordered were mmmhmm- mhmmmm- I love putting ketchup on my hashbrowns (judgment free zone here) which makes them hundred times better. I would recommend putting more havarti cheese, my omelette barely had any cheese, only one half of the omelette had cheese on it. The pancakes were delicious- wow! Not that I think about it, I didn't even use maple syrup because of the housemade cremes they had on the pancakes that made it delicious. I was stuffed at this point (as you can imagine) but it was worth it. My friends skillet was delicious as well, I've never seen asparagus served in an omelette and I was a little concerned how it would taste considering it was steamed first. The spinach, onions, broccoli, mushrooms and tomatoes blended in extremely well with the eggs and cheese. It was finger licking good!!!

Eggs Benedict. My order arrived shortly. It was muy bueno! Yum Yum Yum, Delicioso as Dora would say. The hollandaise sauce was thick, creamy, a bit tart, and tasty. The eggs were poached well. Runny. Just how I like it. The hash brown was cooked well. It wasn't burnt or undercooked. You can actually see potatoes from the shavings. Their prices weren't bad also.

It's definitely a wait to get in for a weekend breakfast.  Thankfully they are with the times and have an app that texts you when your table is ready.  Though you have to stick around close by as they say you have to check back in within 5 minutes of getting the text.  To be fair it also has a link to a website that shows you how many parties are in front of you. (Depressing to see a double digit number when you've been waiting for 40 minutes).  Anyway, on to the main event: Breakfast!<br><br>For you sugar fiends out there, you'll probably love this place as you can see from all the photos of decked out pancakes. But if you're into savory like I am, this isn't the place to hit.  I ordered the skillet with Italian sausage, onions, bell peppers, and tomatoes over hashed browns and was disappointed. The hash browns weren't crispy, the veggies are too big (smaller chunks would have made it easier to eat), and everything needed salt. A lot of salt. And hot sauce. Lots of hot sauce.  Even that didn't fix it.  <br><br>Most skillets that I've had come with the veggies and meat mixed in with the eggs and either next to or on top of the has browns and then covered in cheese.  This dish was more layers... a small layer of hash browns, a thicker layer of veggies and meat, scrambled eggs on top, then a layer of cheese with pancakes on the side.  Some of you may like that, but it's not my cup of tea. At least they give you large portions? <br><br>The service at the front desk was not very friendly, probably because they are dealing with tons of people who are hungry and waiting so if they're anything like me, hangry might be an appropriate adjective.  However to their credit they have their coffee bar right at the door so people can grab coffee while they are waiting so they aren't tired, & hangry.  I had to deal with a rude man who cut in line to put his name down because it was too crowded. I saw him come in after me because I moved to the side to try to accommodate more people in the front area, I guess he didn't see me and when I pointed out that I was there first he was quick to say that I was wrong.  O'well, maybe he was hangry.  Anyway, I put my name in and went to Starbucks a block down to escape the cold, get a hot drink, and work on my computer as the wait was quoted to be an hour.<br><br>As expected about 50 minutes in, I received a text and headed over to the restaurant.  I sat down and ordered some food and the service at the tables were far better.  Friendly, quick, and attentive.  Everything you would want in a server. <br><br>So, executive summary: overwhelmed front desk staff, friendly servers at your table, huge quantities of savory food that is average at best, decent buttermilk pancakes, and a huge wait.  I'm not sure what the hype is about, but it's certainly not the savory foods. I'm probably not going to go back because the food was not worth the wait, but at least it wasn't expensive.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Wildberry is one of my favorite brunch spots in the city, it never disappoints!

My travel buddy got the turkey sandwich with the egg (I'm not entirely sure sandwiches DON'T come with egg these days in Chicago...). I instead tried the skillet and asked for a side of hollandaise. Don't judge me. I wanted to see how they prepared it. They misunderstood and presented my side of their chipotle hollandaise in a ramekin with a soup spoon, as if I was going to eat it like a thick clam chowder. I almost did it was so good.

The Benedict however was slightly underwhelming as the English muffin was a bit rough, and the ham was over cooked in my opinion. Lastly the pancakes were tasty but as a future consideration, they could try integrating the fruits into the pancakes instead of having fruit sauces and several pieces of fruit on the side.

My family and I paid a visit to the Wildberry location within Prudential Tower in Chicago. We checked in, waited for our table and eventually we were seated. For starters, we had to wait at the table for at least 10-15 minutes before our waiter, Jeremy, even came over to ask if we wanted anything to drink. We sat down to a table still being cleaned and the check from the previous patrons still being on the table. When Jeremy finally came over to the table, he was extremely rude and came off with an attitude because of how my mother addressed how we were waiting for so long without receiving a simple \"I will be right with you guys\" from him, which is just common courtesy from a waiter to his/her customer. <br><br>Jeremy's response to my mother was extremely condescending to her, saying \"well the quicker that we start talking about what y'all want to eat, the faster this process can go so what you want\". At that point we were wanting to just leave the restaurant, because how dare you speak that condescending and rudely to customers who have waited over two and a half hours to be seated to have breakfast at your establishment, which gives us NOTHING for free - while laughing and carrying on so politely with other families and customers at other tables throughout the restaurant. <br><br>We placed our drinks order and once Jeremy returned with the drinks, we placed our food orders - which he rushed us through while ordering. At this point, I believe that he could see that we were unsatisfied with the service and tried to tone down the manner in which he was speaking to us, but we were already annoyed and unpleased with him as a waiter. Our meals came and the food was great, as it usually is when we visit the resturaunt - however if I am paying for a service and am a customer within an establishment I expect to be treated a certain way and have waiters and waitresses who knows how to give customer service to their patrons. <br><br>We have also been frequent customers to this Wildberry location, until February of last year, 2017, where we had another run in with a rude worker named Kevin, who spoke to my family again in a very disrespecting and rude manner due to an issue with seatings and reservations. My sister wrote in to the company again was offered a free meal to us; however we were so disgusted with the service that we received then that we haven't returned until today and never bothered to take up the offer from you, which shows how the service has not improved at all from a lot of the waiters and waitresses that are working for Wildberry.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Great crepes and pancakes!

Once our no wait app told us our table was ready, we notified the hosts.  The host took us to our table! Just kidding they didn't, they took us to the building connected to the restaurant and made us wait, again. It was pretty odd and we had to wait an additional 20-30 minutes. <br>After the wait, our server came and got us and placed us on a booth. He was very friendly and sweet. He definitely made our experience more enjoyable. The atmosphere of the restaurant was okay, it was very busy, but I liked that it was spacious. <br>We came with a large group, in total we ordered the Berry Bliss pancakes, Short Rib Hash, Southern Benedict, Mexican Skillet, Oatmeal, Buttermilk pancakes and 2 simple breakfast dishes (Eggs, bacon, and toast). Of all the dishes, the Berry Bliss pancakes was the highlight. The Berry Bliss pancakes had a large array of flavors. It was not overwhelming sweet and the fresh fruits gave the creamy berry sauce a refreshing bite. The pancakes were the perfect texture and were very flavorful. <br>However, as for the rest of the dishes, they were okay. The Mexican Skillet seemed like it had so much to offer on menu, but when it came out of the kitchen, it was extremely bland. I had to add so much salt, pepper, and ketchup to make it taste like anything. The short rib hash lacked flavor as well and the meat was dry. The Southern Benedict was okay, there was nothing bad or special about it, but it was better than the other dishes. <br><br>On the bright side the pancakes I ordered were very good!

The eggs were the perfect balance between fluffy and firm and the salsa they gave for it was delicious. I also ordered a hazelnut latte with soymilk which was excellent as well. One thing I feel that is extremely underrated are their fries. My sister had ordered a veggie burger which was incredible too but the fries are some of the best fries I've had in my life. They were so crispy on the outside but so soft on the inside. Ask for their chipotle ranch as well. You will not regret it.

The lines are long so I recommend you grab one of the pager thingys and walk around the area instead of standing there and wait. So what's so good about this place besides everyone's hype? How many ways can we cook breakfast food that keeps us coming back for more? Well, I think their signature berry pancakes is really the reason to come to this place. I had pancakes with that smooth yet soft texture before, but never done so well like they do it. I think this has something to do with their pancake mix. My only complaint about their pancakes is the fruit that they randomly put in. How can I complain about fruits if it's out of their control to grow it? Well, since they called it berry pancakes they should think about the sweetness and quality of fruits and how it affects their pancakes which they did not do. Otherwise, this is an awesome pancake overall. If you are deciding whether or not to try this place and wondering their pancakes are really worth the 2 hour wait. My answer to you is no, unless you have nothing better to do in an awesome town like Chicago.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "We went to have breakfast at this place on our trip.

The veggie skillet was an incredibly large portion, loaded with hash plus broccoli, peppers, onions, asparagus and tomatoes topped with a heap of egg white. I was expecting more of a sizzling skillet with crisp hash and sauteed veggies but such was not the case. The skillet was baked(not a big deal really) but it wasn't seasoned whatsoever and totally bland. Boo. It had so much potential! I ended up loading on the ketchup to save it. <br><br>The pancakes were equally underwhelming. For a spot known for their pancakes, I expected them to incorporate the ingredients into the batter of the pancake. Instead, the ingredients were just nicely decorated on top. Soo, the kitchen basically makes a ton of standard pancakes and tops it off to order. CG's side of oreo pancakes came with just a sprinkle of crushed oreos. Such a let down!

This portion easily fed two for only $11.95; talk about a steal! For the price of each entree, the prices are ridiculously cheap (i.e. their pancake entrees come with 5 pancakes for $11-$12) compared to breakfast/brunch in New York. For the pancake raves, I expected to be blown away by the Signature Berry Bliss. Although they were good, they weren't fluffy like everyone claimed them to be. To both my friend and I, they were just your standard pancakes, fluffiness wise, but the berry bliss sauce made them better. Surprisingly, it wasn't as sweet as it looked as it was drowned in berry sauce; it was sweet with hints of acidity from the berries. The Mexicana skillet was more unique to us. It came in a huge skillet pan filled with hash browns, chorizo sausage, avocado, jalapeño peppers, onions, cheddar and jack cheese, along with 2 sunny side eggs. It sounds like a lot of ingredients, but everything was perfectly balanced and worked perfectly. Definitely recommend ordering this and upgrading to a speciality pancake! <br><br>My friend and I also had the iced honey toffee nut latte, which was delicious.

Once we arrive, the line is out the door but we manage to skip to the front to check in and amazingly we were sitting ready to order 5 minutes in. <br><br>The menu consists of so many delicious options it was just hard to choose anything really. I started with a cafe mocha, topped with whipped cream of course, and boy was it good ! I ended up going with the Butcher Skillet, 4 different meats with melted cheese and 2 fried eggs on top with a layer of hash browns underneath. I sub'd out my normal pancakes for the Oreo S'more pancakes. The skillet was just absolutely delicious ! And the pancakes really ended up hitting the spot, I always finish my food but I had to throw in the towel with a few bites left because I was going to need a wheelchair out of here.

Obviously they specialize in breakfast, and pancakes in particular.<br><br>The Corned Beef Benny ($10.75) is a take on an Eggs Benedict. The corned beef hash is house made. While good, I would have preferred the corned beef hash to be a little crisper. The eggs were poached well, with a nice runny yolk. A chipotle hollandaise finished the dish, but was lacking in any spice.<br><br>The Crème Brulee French Toast was a thick slice of bread drizzled with a vanilla crème anglaise. I prefer my French toast super soggy, and this one did not fit the bill. I have found that most restaurants will not make French toast super soggy since it takes extra time for the longer soak. I understand that the kitchen needs to turn over food as quickly as possible, but accommodating the probably infrequent request does not seem like a huge ordeal.<br><br>The Red Velvet French Toast ($10.75) was a nice, thick slice of red velvet cake with an insane amount of cream cheese stuffed inside. Once again topped with a vanilla crème anglaise, this was a sure winner.<br><br>The Banana Cream Pie Pancakes ($10.75) were two large pancakes topped with freshly sliced bananas smothered in a mountain of whipped cream. The pancakes were light, but somewhat dense at the same time if that makes any sense. Crumbled brown sugar added a slight textural contrast.<br><br>The Chocolate Chip Pancakes (9.25) were drizzled in chocolate syrup. Chocolate chips were imbedded in the pancakes. These were okay and nothing special.<br><br>One of the specials was Duck Hash, which contained a very generous portion of large pieces of duck intermingled with hash browns. It was topped by 2 eggs. This was a very good dish.<br><br>Although Wildberry specializes in pancakes, I found that they missed the mark on that end.

Of course after they called us we still had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated, but that was ok. They have a nice system going that seems to work for them. If anything about our experience was bad, it was the crammed waiting area. Once you step inside, it feels very claustrophobic and I think opening up the area a little will do it some good. However, you have to work with what you got and they do that nicely. <br><br>Once we sat down we were greeted by a very nice waiter. He took the time to explain specials and answered our questions. He was in such a good mood even though they were swamped and really brightened our experience. Even the busboys were prompt, refilling our waters and taking away empty plates within seconds of us finishing. <br><br>All that aside, when you come to a restaurant you come for the food, so on to the important part. I ordered the berry bliss pancakes and it was a little slice of heaven in my mouth. The berry mascarpone was sweet and tart making a great addition to the vanilla anglaise. The pancakes were fluffy, but still decadent so I only ended up eating half of the breakfast. My boyfriend got the corned beef benedict and that was very good too.

Tigah usually avoids biscuits and gravy for breakfast because most places, the biscuits are dry and dense and use lots of gravy to mask it.  At Wildberry, the biscuits were light, moist and fluffy.

The fig, walnut, and multigrain pancakes are light and fluffy despite the multigrain pancake. <br><br>I have yet to try their Benedict as an entree but I sampled off a friends and the standard Benedict was delightful. The hollandais didn't shine but didn't offend. <br><br>A few words of caution:<br><br>1) if you go on the weekend, expect a wait. If you go after 9 on a weekend, expect a long wait.

EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING. <br><br>All the french toast and pancakes were soft and fluffy with loads of flavor and not overwhelmingly sweet. The red velvet french toast had a nice cream cheese filling between the slices of french toast making it just like red velvet. The banana cream pie and a nice banana cream filling between the pancakes giving it more banana flavor in addition to the fresh slices of bananas. The cinnamon sugar sprinkles were also a nice touch. The HIGHLIGHT was the berry bliss french toast with a nice berry yogurt glaze between the toasts with loads of berry flavor and the vanilla anglaise was superb. <br><br>The skillets came out piping hot! The corn beef was very good, chopped to fine pieces. The only thing they could have improved on was pan fry the corn beef a bit to crisp some of the pieces adding a texture like bacon bits to it, but I was a very happy camper with the corned beef hash skillet. I thought they did an amazing job. The butchers block was also very good with a good variety of meats that were juicy and packed with loads of flavor. Both skillets came with perfectly cooked sunnyside up eggs.<br><br>These 3 dishes stuffed 5 people. And our bill came out to be $9-9.50 per person including tax and tip.

They also made sure our waters were never left empty.

I felt like every Uber driver of mine knew about this place when we would make small talk about my plans while I was in Chicago. It is pretty easy to locate - and since pretty much every one knows about it my Uber driver did not have any problem in regards to dropping me off here. It is located next to Millennium park - so it is a pretty crowded place. When we called in to make reservation they said that they don't take reservations and we ended up waiting for over 2 hours to get seated (there were 12 of us in total). It is in the heart of the city so while we were waiting we had our own photo-shoot and walked around a bit. It has indoor and outdoor seating. For parking, one needs to go around the block and do the street parking. <br><br>The decor is pretty decent, there is couch seating as well as the regular chairs inside.. Our table was right next to to kitchen so there was lot of commotion around us. Our server was really nice and very patient - especially since there were 12 of us. She gave us her suggestions and the most ordered dishes from their menu. She was always smiling and had a great energy. I ended up ordering:<br><br>-- Hot White Chocolate Mocha: it came in a nice big mug, it was pretty good but I feel like since I am used to the Hot White Chocolate Mocha from Starbucks the one from here was little blend according to my taste. <br><br>-- Espanola: It was delicious! It was by far the best omelette I have ever had. The chorizo was well cooked and it was in the right quantity which blended pretty well with the veggies. It comes avocados as well - one can never go wrong with avocados. Jalapenos  in it doesn't make it extremely spicy - it just adds that perfect touch of spiciness to the omelette. The proportions here are huge and I couldn't even finish it. It comes with Hash browns, Toast or a Pancake. You can get their specialty Pancakes with an additional dollar and I opted for that option.<br><br>-- Tiramisu Pancake: IT WAS HEAVENLY! I don't think any words can describe how amazing it was. It is seriously to die for and it made the 2 hour wait worthwhile. For a side plate it is a pretty big proportion.<br><br>Despite the waiting part, food was great and the service was amazing. It is not that pricey. I ended up ordering too much food or could be that their proportions are huge.

By 8:00 however, it was completely packed and there was not one empty table in the place (or on the patio).<br><br>I ordered the Butcher's Block skillet and upgraded the pancakes to the specialty Oreo S'mores pancakes for only a dollar. The skillet was full of meat: pork sausage, turkey sausage, bacon and ham on a bed of hashbrowns and topped with cheese and scrambled eggs. This should have been good, however it was not. There was way too much hashbrowns in there and the hashbrowns were burnt and dry. There was also not that much cheese in there at all and the most disappointing thing was that the meat tasted of low quality and didn't have much seasoning. Overall, the skillet was very dry and bland. Ketchup couldn't even help it.<br><br>The pancakes were much better, They pretty much were the same as IHOP's: thin and very rich. At first I thought it only came with one pancake but was happy to learn that it actually came with two and it was topped with oreos, chocolate syrup and marshmallow creme.

There were also fruit smoothies. <br><br>My party of three opted to order three different menu items: the Mexicana sizzling skillet, which came with a side of buttermilk pancakes sprinkled with powdered sugar; the Fresca eggs-quisite omelette, with a side of signature berry bliss pancakes; and the Rutherford omelette with another side of signature berry bliss pancakes. The pancakes come with two smaller-than-the-average stack-size pancakes, drizzled in vanilla sauce, blackberry sauce, and fresh berries (strawberries, blueberries, blackberries). <br><br>The signature berry bliss pancakes are the most expensive of the specialty pancakes, but the fresh berries and special sauces/drizzles make it worth every bite. <br><br>There is great value for the money to be had here.

This place will make you happy because it's filled with people sharing a happy moment in their lives: tourists with their partners and families. The comfort food will make you happy, too. <br><br>Recommendations:<br><br>Order an entree that comes with pancakes on the side. DO UPGRADE to specialty pancakes at the bargain surcharge of $1.00.

My boyfriend ordered the meat lovers skillet with an over easy egg and a side of Chocolate chip pancakes. We expected to wait for our food, but it was ready within 5-8 minutes. It was so fast! The food was great too. The skillets were amazing. The meat lovers skillet did look smaller than mine though, just FYI. I only finished half of mine because I wanted to make room for the Tiramisu pancakes. Those were heavenly. I was afraid they'd be way too sweet, but they weren't. It was the perfect amount of sweetness. My boyfriend even liked it and he doesn't usually like Tiramisu. The chocolate chip pancakes were good, but they were too chocolately. They put a lot of chocolate chips on the pancakes and it ends up encasing the pancakes in a chocolate coat.

Why are these places filled with people who consider them to be outstanding when all I can muster is a \"Meh\"? I've been a couple of times and both times were rather forgettable.

To state my case as nicely as possible, while trying to refrain from even an ounce of snark, I will say this: If you are a big city, popular, breakfast spot with \"Pancake\" in your name, you'd better have great pancakes. --You cannot rest on your toppings alone. They say that they are \"buttermilk\" pancakes, but if they are, they are assuredly from a mix OR their buttermilk is actually powdered buttermilk. They are missing that airy spongy flavorful goodness that real buttermilk pancakes have. --The very kind that come out of my kitchen. Wildberry can top them with every delicious concoction known to man, but they can't disguise what's on the bottom. --a not so perfect pancake. I want a pancake that is so delicious, you don't need to saturate it with sugars or cover it in whipping cream. It should stand on its own. These are not those. <br><br>While the pancakes are disappointing to me, their omelettes here have always been perfect. Light and fluffy without any signs of being overcooked --such as browning or a rubbery texture. And likewise, the service has always been good. --My waitress even kept her cool and remained polite when the man seated next to me had a coronary over his perceived \"onions\". I felt so bad for her, I tipped her extra well.... because who wants to start their day with such a buffoon??<br><br>I don't flat out dislike Wildberry; I just don't get overly excited about it. If you don't care as much about pancake quality or you're satisfied with Denny's, you might really love this place. I mean, the toppings are good.

After lurking through a lot of places in Chicago on Yelp for Breakfast I had decided that this is where my boyfriend and I would go for our last day in Chicago. We went around 9:00 on a Monday morning and I was worried we were going to have to wait like all the reviews stated. We actually didn't wait at all even though they were still decently busy, a lot of people sitting outside, and it was pretty packed inside. <br><br>Our server was extremely nice and friendly. Helpful and didn't rush us at all. <br>I ordered a vanilla and caramel latte from Intelligentsia Coffee bar and my boyfriend ordered the fresh squeezed orange juice.  Both my latte and his orange juice were really delicious. I still can't get over looking around the room and seeing two women sitting at a table with their Starbucks cups. Why are you drinking nasty burnt tasting coffee when you could be enjoying the amazing coffee here? Crazy. <br><br>Food wise, I ordered the \"Signature Berry Bliss\" Pancakes with a side of hashbrowns, and they were to die for. The pancakes were easily the best pancakes I've ever had in my life. No need for syrup because they are covered in Vanilla Anglaise, Blackberry Coulis, Berry Mascarpone and has a side of berries. It also has blueberries cooked into the batter. The hash browns were also really good. I'm glad our server asked me if I wanted them extra crispy, because I did. I also feel like everyone should just automatically cook hash browns extra crispy. It's the only way to go. <br><br>My boyfriend ordered the \"Denver Skillet.\" The \"Denver Skillet\" has Hash Browns, Cheddar & Jack Cheese, 2 Eggs, Ham, Bell Peppers & Onions. He loved it. I took a bite without Ham (I don't like ham. ew.) and it was really tasty. <br><br>I think the prices are more than fair. You get really large food portions, and we walked out of there feeling like you could have or should have rolled us out in a wheelbarrow. That's how full we felt. <br><br>The only complaint I have about this place is that the seating is really crowded. Once you're sitting at the table you can't really get up.

It's a meat lover's dream. It comes with 2 scrambled eggs, ham, sausage, turkey sausage, chicken sausage, bacon, cheddar jack cheese, and hash browns!  As delectably wonderful as this dish sounds, I felt it lacked a punch of salt as the hash browns and eggs were a little bland.  Maybe, Wildberry was depending on the cured meats to compensate, but if that's the case, it didn't fulfill the job well.<br><br>Corned Beef Hash ($4.25)- Love the texture as it wasn't mushy like most places, but could use more seasoning/salt.<br>----<br>Conclusion: Based on the high reviews, I guess it's fair to say my time at Wildberry fell short of expectations, but I still enjoyed it...even with the one hour wait-time! Wild berry's extensive and creative brunch menu is deserving of praise and a visit when you're in town.  A convenient spot since it's next to Millennium Park where you can check out Cloud Gate while you wait for your table.  <br><br>Extra Notes:<br>-Accepts credit card<br>-Wait times can be a pain--ranging from 30min-1.5 hours.

Whatever it was, the combination of everything was so good. I honestly hate fig newtons but I like to order quirky menu items so I took a chance. Glad I did!! I also ordered the signature berry pancakes for a dollar extra. The pancakes were SOOOO GOOD! Holy crap, still dreaming about the pancakes. They also have them in waffle and crepe version. <br><br>The service was great. I didn't have any problems.

What threw me off was the rules they had. So I generally like my waffles to come out a few mins after my breakfast because I generally don't eat it till the end. This won't take me longer to eat as I would let it sit there regardless. When I asked if I could get it a little later just a few mins she was so hesitating to even ask. But she asked because I was like please and they said no. That is a first as normally I always request this and never had an issue. <br><br>Second my fiancee ordered a lemonade and he said \" try it, this lemonade is strangely warm.\" So I said ok, I tried it than I said oo just ask for more ice. They probably just don't ice the lemonade. So when the waitress asked me if I needed anything. I said \" yes could I please get some hot sauce and ice please?\" So the waitress says \" we don't allowed sharing of drinks\". I said ok but can he get some ice? she repeated it 3 times and kept looking at me and saying we don't allow sharing of drinks. It made me really uncomfortable. I never been to a restaurant that needed to remind me 3 times that we cant share a drink. We didn't have any intention to share drinks. I simply wanted to get him ice because the lemonade was really warm. It really threw me off because I felt like it was extremely rude. If we were sitting there sharing the drink and you had to refill the drink 3-4 times than ok. That is fine. I think she refilled it once and I felt like it was something so small that she made into a big deal. If it wasn't for this experience I would have given them better stars but I thought that was really unprofessional and unnecessary. So remember people DONT SHARE A DRINK unless you want to be insulted. <br><br>As for the food, I enjoyed the berry waffle. I thought it would be more crispy. It is more of a soft waffle. <br><br>We got the southern Benedict and I thought it was ok. The biscuit was a little soft for me and the sauce was ok. I would suggest not getting this. <br><br>We also got the corn beef skillet and that was the best thing we had. It was really good. It taste like corn beef hash mix with hash browns.

The festive environment was a huge contrast to the previous weekday visit where the place was virtually empty. Fortunately, they have an Intelligentsia stand by the door where my friend got a morning drink to keep her company. <br><br>The Corn Beef Benny ($9.50) was amazing. The large plate was stacked with two English muffins, homemade hash, perfectly poached eggs, gooey chipotle hollandaise and hash browns on the side. The corn beef was tender, flavorful, and out of this world. It was sinful to know that the savory flavors would soon join runny egg yolks and chipotle hollandaise sauce as second and third layers of complex flavors. The hash browns were deliciously added to pick up the rest of the hollandaise to make sure nothing was left behind. I highly recommended. <br><br>The Red Velvet French Toast ($8.95) arrived egg battered with cream cheese frosting, warm syrup, and fresh strawberries. The two-piece French Toast had a soft, cake-like muffin consistency, mild buttermilk surge, and a lowdown of cream cheese drizzles. Decent option, but more a novelty than something I would order again.<br><br>Service during this second visit was much improved from the previous.

I didn't think I could do a whole entrée of pancakes this day so I opted for them as a side. My main dish was their Slow Roast Brisket hash with eggs on top. It was great. The potatoes came in good sized pieces and had a decent amount of crispy ones. The brisket  was nice and moist with a small sear on some of the pieces. The gravy on this was freaking great and really blended well with the potatoes (and balanced well too when you added ketchup). The pancakes on the side were good and they were  mabye just a bit overly sweet. The pancake texture was alright, with a bit of fluff (I love fluffy pancakes) and this had a decent amount. I'd definitely recommend if you were pancake person or just likes (or is even just okay) with pancakes.<br>Service: 7/10<br> Their service was pretty normal here IMO for such a packed and popular place.

Ten minutes later, the server was walking by and I stopped him asking about the cappuccino as well as informing him we were ready to order. He said it would be \"any moment\" so we still waited. Finally, the drink came, after fifteen minutes of waiting...for food, I ordered their combo that included two pancakes, two eggs, your choice of meat, and hash browns. You could substitute regular pancakes for their speciality ones, which included chocolate chip, cinnamon roll, cranberry pecan, and many more. My boyfriend ordered the brioche french toast.

It made the wait go by a lot quicker! <br><br>We were seated after about an hour wait and were ready to order immediately (at this point we were starving!). Our waitress was very friendly and played along with how hungry we were by acknowledging our sense of urgency for ordering. My friend order the vanilla berry latte which had a strong, berry taste - very unique and satisfying. I ordered the omelet with the signature pancakes. The omelet was the size of a baby football and was amazing. And i understood why the signature pancakes are a signature dish....so yummy!!! You don't even need syrup with all the berry drizzles on there.

Definitely one of the handiest apps I've seen, I told another group of friends who were in town about the app and it worked out perfectly for them.<br><br>The service is excellent, everyone is really nice and they are quick if you have any questions or requests. Although the only problem I had was that there are a lotttttttt of people who are in the front, waiting to be seated and the employees did not do much about it. It was pretty hard for me to make my snowball clothed self all the way to the front to put my name down for the table. It was even harder for me to pull myself and my friends to the table to be seated. I wish their waiting area had more room, if anything people can always walk around the area while they wait for their name to be called. Other than that the service was great!<br><br>Now to the best part! The FOOOOOD!!! If you order any egg item, either the skillet or the omelette, you can add a Specialty Pancake for $1 more, DEFINITELY choose from the SPECIALTY PANCAKES option! You won't regret it! I decided to order the Venetian Skillet and the Berry Pancake and it was delicious. For the skillet, you can request your eggs to be however you want them to be! I requested for my eggs to be poached because I saw the lady at the table next to me with perfectly poached eggs and I kept scanning the menu for that item, turns out, all you have to do is request for them. The pancakes were not too sweet but like it had the perfect amount of pancake fluffliness paired with the precise amount of syrup. Just typing this is making my mouth water and me miss Chicago. My friend ordered the Mexican Omelette and the Banana Cream Pancakes, which is a MUST!!! It was not overbearingly sweet at all like the dessert, it had the right amount of richness and sweetness to it. I can definitely eat another plateful or two of it! We also ordered the Berry Waffles which were yummlicious as well! Our total including tip came out to ONLY $42!!! Which is a steal and the best part is that you are full to your satisfaction but you aren't full to the point where you can't walk out the door. It was definitely a happiness full. <br><br>I am definitely returning here in the future, hands down it is one of the best brunch/breakfast spots I've been to in my life! If you are in town or you live in Chicago, you DEFINITELY HAVE TO GO!!!! Remember to download the app NoWait, you will be grateful for it later, as it not only comes in handy for Wildberry, but many other restaurants!!! Don't forget to order an egg item and pay an extra $1 for the SPECIALTY PANCAKE!!!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Great breakfast.  Be prepared to wait in line but worth it.  We had a large party of 8 and were treated well.  Service was great as was the food.  Generous portions and quick coffee refills.<br><br>All in all, a great breakfast in Chicago!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Came here on a Friday at 9:30am this place is busy!!

Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe. <br><br>Was in town for a conference, and 3 Chicagoans recommended this spot for brunch, so we gave it a try. PRO TIP- Yelp lets you get on the waitlist from the app, and you'll want to do that since the wait on weekends is about 1.5 hours. But it's soooo worth it. We weren't going to chance it, so I signed up on the Yelp waitlist and we also went to the restaurant to sign up in person, and confirmed the wait time. As visitors, we took the time to walk around the city, visit Millennium Park, and do other basic girl Chicago things, and that really helped pass the time. And finally, we received the text that sent us sprinting towards the restaurant for our table. <br><br>Atmosphere: <br>Instantly greeted by the sweet smell of pancakes. Huuuuge restaurant, but definitely packed, although not to the point where it feels cramped. They have a variety of seating options, from booths to tables and etc. The decor is super cute and unique; I remember commenting on it while salivating over the menu. The wait staff is super friendly and informative, and the wait for the food is probably proportional to your hanger level. Still, every patron has the moment when the tray of piping hot breakfast foods stops at your table, and you know you've reached the stairway to heaven. <br><br>Food:<br>Seriously, if I'm dying and randomly happen to be in Chicago, take me here and let me enjoy my last blissful moments surrounded by my friends formerly known as the Signature Wildberry Pancakes and the Butcher Block Skillet. If I find out you took me to a hospital instead, I will be unspeakably upset. I cannot believe how much quality food you get for the price (maybe totaled $12 before tax). I was going to go for pancakes for sweet and bacon for savory until I saw the skillet options. The Butcher Block skillet offers a huge serving of hashbrowns, endless turkey ( or was it ham), sausage, and BACON, onions and other worthy vegetables, and is topped off with 2 eggs any way you like them ( the correct answer is over medium so the yolk comes crying down the heap of breakfast). I was beyond thrilled  to find out the skillet comes with either toast or pancakes, so obviously I added $1.5 and got the signature Wildberry Pancakes to find out if the namesake was any good. Oh my goodness. Each bite of pillowy goodness contained more berries than I could count, a wildberry syrup of sorts that wasn't too sweet but still made a perfect binding, and the lightest marscapone I've ever had. Holy cow. Still unsure if it's pancake or just cake. My friends ordered other skillets with the pancakes and were also very satisfied with their meals.  Under normal circumstances, I would absolutely advocate for making this two meals ( maybe three if you're a good person). But my hunger level +the fact I was leaving the city in an hour + the fact that I was in heaven = I ate every single decadent bite of the skillet and the pancakes. No berry left behind. No regrets, just love. <br><br>Maybe it's the happy tourist speaking, but this was hands down my favorite meal of the trip, and I cannot wait to come back to Chicago for another bite (or several bites) here.

I did not like it that much. Maybe 2 - 3 stars. It was a bit on the dry side and the duck was a bit chewy.

Wildberry almost didn't happen because it's a bit hard to find. <br><br>DIRECTIONS: Heading west, it's on Randolph St but before Michigan Ave. It's located in a business-like complex on the right side of the street. There is a small but obscure banner that says Wildberry in an almost illegible font. Your best bet if driving is to head east on Lake St, turn right on Stetson Ave, and walk around by turning the right corner to Randolph since it's a busy street. There is street parking on Stetson Ave. <br><br>FIRST IMPRESSIONS: My party and I were excited that we finally found the place and could try a brunch place unique to Illinois with 4.5 stars and thousands of reviews. Much to our surprise, Wildberry was already hoppin' on a Tuesday morning. What surprised me most was that for such a touristy area, I expected more patrons who were tourists. Instead, there was a decent number of locals in business attire, having sit down brunch on a weekday morning. <br><br>FOOD: We ordered to-go for our party of 12. We ordered: 1 omelette (the Napa Valley Fig); 1 skillet (the Garden), with a side of Fig & Walnut Multi-Grain Pancakes; and 1 French toast (the Wildberry). Food was amazing, even when as take-out. Savory food hit the spot, though Tabasco would have taken it off the charts. Loved seeing asparagus as an ingredient on the Garden, as I feel it's not a common brunch ingredient. Sweets were not too sweet and didn't require syrup to aid in taste or texture. People in our party raved about both the French toast and pancakes. Addition of fresh berries in the Wildberry French toast was absolutely delightful. Overall, we all agreed the food was a good choice.  <br><br>10/10 would come here again or at least recommend Wildberry as brunch spot for anyone in downtown Chicago.

I loved the combinations of toppings. Whether it be pecans, apples, or cinnamon. The best thing might actually be their skillets. Everything is fresh and hot, with the cheese melted into the skillet. Served on top of perfect hash browns. One skillet is easily good for two people. They also serve Intelligentsia coffee inside, which is genius. <br><br>Lastly, price: Very good. Not over-priced at all. Just depends on what you ordered, but overall very fair. 2 people can feast under $35.<br><br>The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I left feeling like, \"I could have made all of that at home.\" If you're used to cooking, which I am, you may feel the same.

The eggs were nice and runny and you could really taste the delicious chorizo. The avocado gave the dish a nice creamy flavor and the salsa added a nice kick to it. The Jalapeños were present with another kick but did not overpower the dish (a common problem with jalapeños). Best skillet I've ever had. It was a little greasy but not too bad for a skillet. The corned beef Benny was good. The English muffin was nice and fluffy but I wish I had tasted more corned beef. The berry bliss pancakes were heavenly! There was some nice fresh berries on the side. The craime anglaise was deliciously sweet with a nice vanilla flavor. The berry mascarpone sauce between the pancakes was rich and warm and made the pancakes even better.

Either way, it's definitely worth the trip! <br><br>Came with friends pretty early in the morning to avoid the lines. Luckily, our plan worked and we were seated immediately. My friends started off with lattes made with Intelligentsia coffee, which Wildberry serves and I chose to go with a flavored lemonade which are bottomless (score!) I tried pretty much all the flavors, but passionfruit and kiwi stood out. <br><br>We ordered the butcher block, garden and venetian sizzlin skillets which come with 2 eggs of your choice as well as pancakes or toast as sides. I'm all about that runny egg yolk action so I got mine poached. Instead of getting the ordinary toast or pancakes, we all upgraded our pancakes to the berry bliss pancakes which is about a dollar more (do it!!). Despite all the food that we were about to receive, we were a bit overzealous and ordered chicken sausage links and stuffed strawberry cheesecake french toast as well. <br><br>The skillets were all equally tasty, but I still prefer the butcher block skillet which has ham, sausage and bacon. I took a bite of my friend's garden skillet, which was good, but too many veggies for my taste, haha. The berry bliss pancakes were stuffed with blueberries and mascarpone and topped with fresh blackberries, strawberries, vanilla creme anglaise and blackberry coulis. At first I thought there were waay too many things going on, but everything worked. The pancakes are light and fluffy; the mascarpone is creamy and creme anglais rich, but the tartness from the coulis and fresh fruit keep the dish from being cloyingly sweet. I loved the chicken sausage -- flavorful with a nice sear on the outside. Although I enjoyed the stuffed french toast, I could only take a couple bites because I was A) full and B) combo of brioche + cheesecake filling made for a super rich dish<br><br>Our server was great at clearing our plates and making sure we were taken care of.

Beware though because if you are getting the pancakes then this is just too much sweetness. I got the berry bliss pancakes and I guess a full order is 5, a short is 3 but you can get a side with 2. Even two was too much but I had to try it. There is sauce between the pancakes too so it was all so sweet jeez. I thought it was a solid pancake. We got the Mexican savory plate and that was completely necessary to balance out the sweetness. You get stuff on the side so we upgraded the pancake to the smore oreo one. Jeez do not get that.

What stood out for me was a subtle taste of fresh (yes, you heard it right, fresh) olive oil that made the omlette all the more enjoyable. The hash browns were crispy (I ordered it crispy) and delicious. Seasonal specials are a must-have. Somehow, the ingredients for all the items we ordered tasted very fresh.

It comes with a side sauce but I personally haven't tried it, since I didn't really need any more flavor. The berry bliss mix is just wonderful, it's a mix of vanilla anglaise, blackberry coulis, and berry mascarpone with fresh berries. I didn't know what an anglaise or coulis is and I didn't care, because it tastes amazing. <br><br>Another great berry bliss option is the crepes, which I actually prefer to the pancakes.

The stone work is amazing, it's a really large location with great decor vaulted ceilings, big windows providing natural-lighting, and I've only seen a small portion of it. The booths are nice and roomy, too. <br><br>The food is amazing! I rarely venture to the lunch menu when here but the items I've tried, like the turkey cranberry sandwich on a pretzel roll, was really yummy. But it's truly all about the breakfast here, at least for me. The skillets are full of flavor and extremely hearty- my fave is the Mexicana, oh baby! Omelettes are consistently cooked light and fluffy, just perfectly, and they don't skimp on ingredients or sides- or portions for that matter. Pancakes are delicious, especially if you get it smothered in something fruity and sweet, or decadently chocolatey- kids love the ooey, gooey chocolatey s'mores pancakes EVERY TIME- or if you tend as I do toward the crepes instead, they will let you upgrade your pancake side to that and they are delicious.<br><br>Another nice option is all the healthy options they offer, like using EVOO instead of butter, or egg whites or beaters instead of regular eggs. They make it easy to cut calorie corners if that's your goal, albeit you'd have to be quite disciplined in a place like this, but it can be done. :) They are great about switching out ingredients, too, even if you can be high maintenance like me. <br><br>Intelligentsia is always a welcome sight for my coffee here. And they make a mighty fine cup. Also noteworthy are the hash browns. They give them a great crispy sear and still soft on the insides, plus I have them add onion to mine.

I didn't want the temptation that day, but I did want the value. :) Yup, told you- high maintenance! Oh, you'll make points with your dad and MIL for the Dutch apple pancake, I know I did. Yummy, and insanely huge, sweet and decadent. <br><br>I've always had fantastic service at either Wildberry I've been to, even when busy, which boy-oh-boy, this one was swamped last visit.

Well, all I can say is that Wildberry GETS THE JOB DONE!!

These pancakes are delicious made with marscapone and fresh berries along with vanilla anglause and garnished with blackberry coulis along with blueberries.  They were light and fluffy--everything and more that you want your pancakes to be.  It's a good thing that you're only given two because they are so rich that you would not be able to eat more.  So, because it was a shoutout from the Hamilton actor, Chris Lee, who got me to try this place, I'll end with a special shoutout to the Wildberry staff who made the visit special, some of whom resembled the Hamilton cast, Jeremy and G, and my girl, AhTian who posed with me.  I will definitely visit, again, on my next trip to Chicago and will, once again, use the No Wait App!  It cut our actual waiting at the site time to less than 15 minutes!!'

We decided to hit it up since the ratings seemed pretty solid.<br><br>What's nice is that Wildberry is a fairly large breakfast spot and both times we came here we were seated immediately with no wait time despite it looking pretty busy when we arrived. This surprised me considering how much of a following this place has. <br><br>The menu is redic! It's huge and there is a big selection of pancakes, skillets, omelettes, French toast, etc.  There were about ten different flavors of pancakes and French toast!  I knew just from the menu that this place was going to rock.  It took me a while to decide but I decided to go with buttermilk pancakes and a side of applewood smoked bacon. <br><br>Our waitress was on it, she brought my friend and I a whole plate of syrup and butter (my friend ordered French toast). I always like having extra syrup just in case I need more and there was plenty to go around between the two of us. <br><br>Now for the food itself. I'll admit, when I ordered the pancakes I was expecting one or two, but instead I was brought FIVE! Wow, FIVE pancakes for $7?! Amazing! Not to mention they were super fluffy and sweet, just the way I like them. I dowsed them in syrup and I was in pancake bliss. I was brought three large and thick slices of bacon on the side. The bacon was great - not too chewy and not too crispy. Perfectly cooked and savory. <br><br>As I said, I came here twice and had the same thing both times (seriously, the pancakes were just that good). The service is amazing and the servers are very friendly and on the ball. I wish there could be a breakfast spot like this where I live, I would hit it up regularly. Wildberry is a great breakfast/brunch place. One of my favorite dining experiences while visiting Chicago. Hope to be back someday!  <br><br>Oh yeah, my breakfast totaled out to about $15 (I also ordered a strawberry lemonade), not bad at all for the portions and quality of food.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/suPhTOz2nAED6-7AyF5IZA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Applewood smoked bacon and a plate of syrup and butter!"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QPdiFwCGvEJguxUJD4Ae2A/168s.jpg", "caption": "Buttermilk pancakes (five stack)"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "The food is good but not great.

The hostess insisted on seating me in a direct line of traffic even though I had 3 pieces of awkward luggage; I had to ask her more than once for a seat that would accommodate all of my luggage and not trip the employees serving food (again, plenty of empty spots all over the restaurant).

Then again, it's enough time to walk a block over to Toni Patisserie and have a macaroon \"amuse bouche\" or take a stroll through Millennium Park while you're waiting. We waited 1.5 hours on a Sunday and 45 minutes on the MLK holiday (though it turned out to be only 25 minutes--luckily we were back in time).  <br><br>The first time I went with the ham and eggs, with a side of cinnamon roll pancakes--they have a number of \"specialty pancakes\" that are delicious, and you can get them on the side for a small upcharge. Crispy string-potato-style hash browns, just like I like them. Intelligentsia coffee--you have to respect a breakfast place with good coffee.<br><br>Monday I had the corned beef hash, which I didn't like as well; though it might just be my personal preference. The corned beef was ground even finer than ground beef, and the potatoes were the same as in the hash browns. Granted, it makes sense linguistically for \"hash\" brown potatoes to be in hash, but my lengua prefers the taste and texture of other varieties. It was still tasty enough. My friend had the Rutherford, with spinach, caramelized onions, goat cheese. Yum, what's not to like about that? <br><br>Very friendly service, and the food comes quickly and hot. And whipped butter? You shouldn't have!

There isn't really that much that is too special about the breakfast items offered, but they do do them well. Their hash browns are perfectly cooked - moist and yet crispy. Their pancakes are just the right consistency, and the whipped butter and maple syrup they provide are perfect accompaniments. I love that they offer fruit as a substitute to hash browns even if no one at the table wanted to go the healthy route.<br><br>But in the end, service is pretty important to me. My first time there, the hosts and hostesses were gracious and friendly. They obviously knew what they were doing and had seated guests before in a hectic environment. The wait staff also knew what they were doing but that apparently doesn't mean they don't rush people out the door. We had barely finished eating when our check arrived and our plates were cleared.

Although one person may take your order we've always had others serving the food or filling water, each one friendly. Now the food. I'm still full 5 hours later so save your appetite so you can enjoy all you can. My favorites are the cinnamon roll pancakes- so so good. Today I ordered the Fresca omelette which comes with hash browns or fruit and pancakes or ( I think there's another choice but for crying out loud order the pancakes! The omelette was delicious and so big- stuffed with sun dried tomatoes, fresh basil, avocado and tons of provolone cheese. Oh. So. Good. You can choose either crispy or soft hash browns which is I why I choose them- I usually order and they are soft which is not my style so loved that I could get them crispy.
