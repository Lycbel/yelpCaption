The Signature Berry Bliss pancakes (fresh berries, jam, and marscapone cheese) was so worth it! \nWe weren't too thrilled with the brisket hash, but the skillet was really, really good.\n\nFor coffee, we got the Honey Toffee Nut Latte and Vanilla Berry Latte.

Overall, the pancakes were delicious but the skillets left much to be desired. We ordered the Barbacoa Chilaquiles skillet, the Garden skillet, and a side of wildberry and blueberry pancakes. The Barbacoa was flavorful, but some bites were EXTREMELY spicy. They may have unevenly spread the spices and it became a bit unbearable to eat without taking water breaks. The Garden skillet, however, was entirely opposite. I'm talking NO spices what so ever. It left me extremely confused... they were saut\u00e9ed veggies with an egg on top. That's quite literally it. It was as bland as you could get. Do not recommend!\n\nAs far as pancakes, they were both rich, creamy, and not overpoweringly sweet. Great choices.

They close at 2:30pm and we barely made it just before 2pm. I ordered the Wild Mushroom Omelette which was really good. I upgrade my pancakes for just $2 to the Signature Berry Bliss pancakes. I don't usually get pancakes at brunch but this was a good decision ! My boyfriend got the Homemade Corned Beef Hash Skillet which he really liked. He upgraded the pancakes for the Chocolate Banana Bread French Toast. We both really liked this as well. It's definitely on the sweeter side but since it was just half an order, it wasn't too overwhelming. I also tried a little bit of the Oreo S'mores Pancakes and that was way too sweet for me. \n\nThe service was phenomenal here. Our waiter constantly checked up on us and refilled our drinks.

Simply incredible. \n\nFirst things first, hop in line on the Yelp app and make your way there around that time. And then wait a little longer..You can even wait in a building adjacent to them to stay warm/dry during inclement days. They have four friendly faces to greet you inside the door and then shoot you a text when you should come inside to wait and then holler your name when its time to be seated. We were shown to our table ana greeted by our waitress promptly. She took our drink order and quickly re-appeared with some of the best coffee I have had at a breakfast restaurant. \n\nI inquired with her about which pancake they were most known for and she immediately retorted with the wild berry and cinnamon roll.  With that knowledge in mind I ordered the Mexican Skillet and the Wild Berry Pancake on the side. My sister ordered an omelette with the cinnamon roll pancakes so we could all try each others. \n\nMy skillet was to die for. I ordered it without jalapenos and it was incredible. The chorizo was so flavorful and everything was mixed just perfectly. The melted the cheese, the avocado...YUM! And not to mention it fed me breakfast for TWO days because it was massive. And I am happy to report it is equally as good on day two. My mom and sister both really enjoyed their omelettes and the fruit that came with my moms was very obviously fresh which is a nice change. And none of us could decide which pancake we liked more. So all in all we got to try so many things and everything was hot, fresh, and delicious.

We signed up to get on their wait list and were seated in 45 minutes on a Saturday late morning. Instead of waiting outside and getting hangry, we decided to spend that time hanging around the bean, which was very close - so I suggest doing that if you have a long wait!\n\nI shared the Mexicana skillet served with a side of\"signature berry bliss\" pancakes! I absolutely loved the Mexicana skillet - the saltiness of the chorizo and spicy/freshness of jalape\u00f1os were really good with the hash browns, which were on the blander side. Having the eggs cooked over easy was the right move because the yolk running through all the components in the skillet really made this dish! \n\nThe berry bliss pancakes on the other hand, were a little disappointing. I thought the pancakes were a bit tough and I didn't like the drizzle on top. It tasted too tangy for me. \n\nOverall, my friends had a great experience at Wildberry.

Across the street from Millennium Park on Randolph is tough to beat. This place is always jammed packed with tourist. \n\nI worked in the same building as Wildberry for 6 years and was a regular because of the convenience. I've tried just about every item on the menu. To avoid the long wait, we'd often place to-go orders.\n\nWhile I'd never had a bad meal, I think Wildberry is on par with just about any slightly above average breakfast restaurant. I guess it depends on what you like. I'm not a big fan of Yolk or The Bongo Room. Wildberry is on the same plane.\n\nI actually prefer the lunch options over breakfast. The burger is seraphic when not overcooked. The havarti cheese and onion jam are the perfect accompaniment. \n\nLong story short. ..

Oh no, that's always the beginning of some angry Yelpers review. I am not angry though, I am just kind of......meh, for lack of a better term of what I feel for Wildberry. \n\nI read all the raving reviews and saw the waitlist and I knew I had to check this place out. Kudos, to my fellow Yelpers for letting me know about the waitlist. I literally put myself on it from the comfort of my hotel and went there when only 30 people were ahead of me (I started the waitlist at 145 people ahead of me). When we arrived we waited about five minutes before we were seated! That was awesome, because the line to get in this place was insane! I felt like VIP cutting the line. \"Move out the way, the Queen is here\" is something I may or may not have thought while being seated.\n\nOnce we were seated I was immediately disappointed. This is a no frills diner. Equivalent to IHOP or Denny's. I was expecting a little more but whatever, I figured the food is why the people are lined up to get in this place. \n\nThe food arrives and while it looked good, it was just....meh! Actually I take that back, the pancakes were amazing! However, the rest of the breakfast left no real impression. \n\nI suppose that is the downside of being a Yelper.

Actually, take my previous five, add my current five and make it a ten. \n\nI went back the following day like I said I would and was greeted by the lovely hostesses with \"you're back!\" Of course, I can't get enough. \n\nSo this time I wanted both breakfast and lunch. I ordered the turkey pepper jack panini with sweet potato fries and a \"little berry\" order of the berry bliss pancakes. \n\nThe berry bliss pancakes will change your life and have you second guessing if you should order any other type of pancake. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure all of them are great. But this was is extra extra great. And so was my turkey panini! I was stuffed and couldn't finish it all. \n\nJust wishing I could pack up Wildberry and bring it back to Baltimore with it. \n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nCurrently kicking myself for ordering the most basic item on the menu: egg white omelet with pepper jack cheese, plain pancakes and turkey bacon. Don't get me wrong, everything tasted great. Actually more than great. Actually so good, I'm planning my visit back before I leave Chicago. \n\nI got there a little bit before closing and the restaurant was packed but I was still seated within 15 minutes. \n\nMy server was great as well. Can't wait to come back!", "author": "Bell A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-11-09", "description": "Lets me start off my saying this place was all the reviews raved about!\n\nFrom good service to amazing food, I would not second guess myself on giving this place 5 stars. My only tip to people planning on visiting this place for breakfast is to get there early or put yourself on the waiting list before you leave your hotel. \n\nMy girlfriend and I got there at around 7:30. Upon arriving, we made our way through the revolving door and was welcomed by a huge amount of people waiting by the entrance to escape the cold, brisk morning air. After putting my girlfriend and I on the waiting list, I received a text confirming that we were added to the list and would be notified when to come back to the restaurant. Considering this place was across from Millennium Park, we walked over to kill time -which in my opinion was great because there was no one at The Cloud so it was a great time to take pictures.\n\nAbout 40 minutes later, my girlfriend received a text to make our way back to the restaurant. Once we checked in with the hostess, we waited another 5 minutes. Once we were seated, we were greeted by a very nice waitress who asked us what we would like to drink as we also asked what she would recommend. She was very knowledgable in terms of product knowledge. \n\nOkay- lets get on to the food. All you need to do is look at the picture attached. It says it all. The food looked as good as it tasted. \n\nHighly recommend upgrading your side to the speciality pancakes! They are delicious!  Everything about this place was great from the service, to the food, to the turn over time (the waiters are so quick to clean tables and take away your empty plates).\n\nThank you Wildberry for an amazing breakfast experience in Chicago.", "author": "Jason A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-11-25", "description": "Despite the inevitable wait (due to its location downtown) you'll have here, DO IT. You won't be disappointed. I recommend you get on their text check-in in advance. This establishment serves breakfast, brunch, and lunch, closing at 3pm. The portions are VERY filling/hearty, and considering the location, the prices are excellent. Very attentive and friendly staff. Great pancakes!", "author": "Simone T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-10-29", "description": "Well worth the wait and hype! ***GET ON THE WAITING LIST VIA YELP before arriving.*** normal lunch wait for two is 1.5 hrs!\n\nOk with that out of the way, the bf and I came here for lunch. On our way over we joined the wait list via Yelp, wait time? 1 hr 45 minutes, holy...\n\nTook us 20 minutes to get there, squeezed past the crowds to check in, and the hostess told us they will text when ready. Luckily, you have the beautiful Millennium Park across the street to sight see, play tourist, work up an appetite, and kill time.\n\nText came in which gave me 5 minutes to get to the front. Little did they know, I was already there. LOL Checked in once again and stood there waiting to be seated- 3 more parties ahead but all got seated quickly.\n\nService is fast, there are many servers, bus boys, and hostess. Workers are very efficient and good at their job, which keeps the patrons flowing.\n\nNow to the juicy part, the FOOD:\n\n1) Corned Beef Hash Skillet- 5 stars! The corned beef is homemade. Comes with hash browns or fruit, toast or pancakes (but sub with the Berry Bliss Waffle +$5 but well worth it bc a seperate waffle order will cost you $13).  The corned beef hash was so deliciously flavored, tender, minced, and yet still had a little crunch factor from the mixed in hash.\n\n2) Berry Bliss Waffle- 5+ stars, this dish beats most waffles I've ever eaten. I was very full after finishing my benedicts, but knew I needed to try this beautiful waffle. I ended up eating half the waffle and wanted to order more regardless of how full I was. My boyfriend talked some sense into me and I sadly agreed.\n\n2. Florence Benedict- 5 stars, loaded with spinach and bacon bites, topped with a perfectly poached egg, and dressed with a very nice, creamy hollandaise sauce with a hint of lemon.\n\nDouble espresso-strong and flavorful\n\nOrange juice- freshly squeezed!", "author": "Nhi H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-11-06", "description": "Bottom line: great breakfast/ lunch spot, go\n\nLong line: had a great time here. The lines are long for good reason. The food is absolutely delicious. I forget the name of my dish, but as pictured it was huge and had hashbrowns, eggs, the works. My friend got their special pancakes and they too were amazing. Service was quick and friendly. I would definitely return.", "author": "Diego M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-11-30", "description": "Wait Time Review \n\nThe breakfast is exceptional but the wait time on a weekend is outrageous. The downtown location does not allow customers to stand in the commercial building the restaurant is connected to. With that being said, customers are supposed to wait outside if there is no room in the restaurant. Waiting for food in cold weather is not fun at all. So imagine standing in the commercial building being yelled at by security to stand outside. Not fun, not fun at all. \n\nHowever, once you get a seat the food and service is great.", "author": "A.

I think it's going to be a regular spot for me whenever I'm in town. \nI unfortunately can't remember our waitress's name but she was really good, quirky and attentive without being annoying. \nOn to my favorite, the food!\nI ordered the corned beef hash, made in house along with two over easy eggs and a berry bliss crepe. It was so good I'm actually thinking about driving back to Chicago right now as I write this review. \nI could eat like this everyday! It was a perfect meal, savory and crunchy from the corned beef; sweet and fluffy from the crepe.

It was truly difficult to squeeze by people on a rainy Chicago Saturday and we had to catch a flight. Can't recall the wait time, but it was significant and we knew heading to another establishment would result in waiting plus travel time any way.Nevertheless, we made it in. Grabbed the regular two eggs any style breakfast with eggs overeasy and Applewood bacon. I wanted those specialty pancakes, but not just on its own. So chose the signature berry bliss.When it came, I was pretty sure I wouldn't finish the whole meal. The bacon was crisp and the eggs done as ordered. Then the indulgent magic of the berry bliss. Wow. Jam-packed with flavor. I had to bow out after eating barely half of it. So good. Would come here when I'm in town again.<p>    </div>            <div itemprop="review" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">        <meta itemprop="author" content="Onvara A.">        <div itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating">            <meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="4.0">        </div>        <meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-12-05">        <p itemprop="description">I think Wildberry gets a lot of hype because of its central location near Millenium Park. While the food was good, I'm not sure if it was worth the 45 minute wait.We got the Slow Roast Brisket Hash (brisket, roasted red peppers, onions, and sausage gravy served with two eggs on a bed of potatoes and a side of toast) and the Mexicana Sizzlin' Skillet (hashbrowns, cheddar & peppejack cheese, two eggs, chorizo sausage, roasted jalapenos, avocado, cilantro, and onions). The skillet came with a side of pancakes, so we substituted for a specialty pancake for an extra $2. The Signature Berry Bliss pancakes (fresh berries, jam, and marscapone cheese) was so worth it! We weren't too thrilled with the brisket hash, but the skillet was really, really good.For coffee, we got the Honey Toffee Nut Latte and Vanilla Berry Latte. Both were too sweet for our liking, and they served them to us in paper cups so there was no latte art. I'd recommend skipping the fancy lattes and just going for regular drip coffee here.<p>    </div>            <div itemprop="review" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">        <meta itemprop="author" content="Anna M.">        <div itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating">            <meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="4.0">        </div>        <meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-12-02">        <p itemprop="description">Came here for a Sunday brunch and waited for nearly 2 hours before we were able to be seated, as do most people! Overall, the pancakes were delicious but the skillets left much to be desired. We ordered the Barbacoa Chilaquiles skillet, the Garden skillet, and a side of wildberry and blueberry pancakes. The Barbacoa was flavorful, but some bites were EXTREMELY spicy. They may have unevenly spread the spices and it became a bit unbearable to eat without taking water breaks. The Garden skillet, however, was entirely opposite. I'm talking NO spices what so ever. It left me extremely confused... they were sautéed veggies with an egg on top. That's quite literally it. It was as bland as you could get. Do not recommend!As far as pancakes, they were both rich, creamy, and not overpoweringly sweet. Great choices. There's a reason the restaurants name isn't Wildberry Skillets, so choose accordingly...<p>    </div>            <div itemprop="review" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">        <meta itemprop="author" content="Valerie T.">        <div itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating">            <meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="5.0">        </div>        <meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-11-26">        <p itemprop="description">Wildberry's has several locations in Chicago and this was super close to Millennium Park. Definitely a place for diabeetus overload ;) I ordered the Red Velvet French Toast and it was an absolute dream. Very sugary and has cream cheese frosting drizzled all over. Don't come here if you already had your sugar intake of the day. It did feel more like a cake roll than French toast though. It's also rather sweet enough already without the extra syrup.<p>    </div>            <div itemprop="review" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">        <meta itemprop="author" content="Annie T.">        <div itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating">            <meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="5.0">        </div>        <meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-11-27">        <p itemprop="description">I finally tried this brunch spot on Sunday. They close at 2:30pm and we barely made it just before 2pm. I ordered the Wild Mushroom Omelette which was really good. I upgrade my pancakes for just $2 to the Signature Berry Bliss pancakes. I don't usually get pancakes at brunch but this was a good decision ! My boyfriend got the Homemade Corned Beef Hash Skillet which he really liked. He upgraded the pancakes for the Chocolate Banana Bread French Toast. We both really liked this as well. It's definitely on the sweeter side but since it was just half an order, it wasn't too overwhelming. I also tried a little bit of the Oreo S'mores Pancakes and that was way too sweet for me. The service was phenomenal here. Our waiter constantly checked up on us and refilled our drinks. He was very energetic and friendly towards us which I appreciate. I will definitely come back here for brunch!<p>    </div>            <div itemprop="review" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">        <meta itemprop="author" content="Caitlin K.">        <div itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating">            <meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="5.0">        </div>        <meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-11-26">        <p itemprop="description">Incredible. Simply incredible. First things first, hop in line on the Yelp app and make your way there around that time. And then wait a little longer..You can even wait in a building adjacent to them to stay warm/dry during inclement days. They have four friendly faces to greet you inside the door and then shoot you a text when you should come inside to wait and then holler your name when its time to be seated. We were shown to our table ana greeted by our waitress promptly. She took our drink order and quickly re-appeared with some of the best coffee I have had at a breakfast restaurant. I inquired with her about which pancake they were most known for and she immediately retorted with the wild berry and cinnamon roll.  With that knowledge in mind I ordered the Mexican Skillet and the Wild Berry Pancake on the side. My sister ordered an omelette with the cinnamon roll pancakes so we could all try each others. My skillet was to die for. I ordered it without jalapenos and it was incredible. The chorizo was so flavorful and everything was mixed just perfectly. The melted the cheese, the avocado...YUM! And not to mention it fed me breakfast for TWO days because it was massive. And I am happy to report it is equally as good on day two. My mom and sister both really enjoyed their omelettes and the fruit that came with my moms was very obviously fresh which is a nice change. And none of us could decide which pancake we liked more. So all in all we got to try so many things and everything was hot, fresh, and delicious. I cannot wait to get back and try even more!<p>    </div>            <div itemprop="review" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">        <meta itemprop="author" content="Hannah K.">        <div itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating">            <meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="5.0">        </div>        <meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-11-21">        <p itemprop="description">Wildberry Pancakes was recommended to me by multiple people so I knew I had to try! We signed up to get on their wait list and were seated in 45 minutes on a Saturday late morning. Instead of waiting outside and getting hangry, we decided to spend that time hanging around the bean, which was very close - so I suggest doing that if you have a long wait!I shared the Mexicana skillet served with a side of"signature berry bliss" pancakes! I absolutely loved the Mexicana skillet - the saltiness of the chorizo and spicy/freshness of jalapeños were really good with the hash browns, which were on the blander side. Having the eggs cooked over easy was the right move because the yolk running through all the components in the skillet really made this dish! The berry bliss pancakes on the other hand, were a little disappointing. I thought the pancakes were a bit tough and I didn't like the drizzle on top. It tasted too tangy for me. Overall, my friends had a great experience at Wildberry. The staff was very friendly, food was great, and portions were HUGE.

Across the street from Millennium Park on Randolph is tough to beat. This place is always jammed packed with tourist. I worked in the same building as Wildberry for 6 years and was a regular because of the convenience. I've tried just about every item on the menu. To avoid the long wait, we'd often place to-go orders.While I'd never had a bad meal, I think Wildberry is on par with just about any slightly above average breakfast restaurant. I guess it depends on what you like. I'm not a big fan of Yolk or The Bongo Room. Wildberry is on the same plane.I actually prefer the lunch options over breakfast. The burger is seraphic when not overcooked. The havarti cheese and onion jam are the perfect accompaniment. Long story short. .. Wildberry is fine, but there are better options in the area and countless more if you explore other neighborhoods.<p>    </div>            <div itemprop="review" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">        <meta itemprop="author" content="Pousy M.">        <div itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating">            <meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="3.0">        </div>        <meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-11-18">        <p itemprop="description">Sometimes Yelp reviews should be taken with a grain of salt! Oh no, that's always the beginning of some angry Yelpers review. I am not angry though, I am just kind of......meh, for lack of a better term of what I feel for Wildberry. I read all the raving reviews and saw the waitlist and I knew I had to check this place out. Kudos, to my fellow Yelpers for letting me know about the waitlist. I literally put myself on it from the comfort of my hotel and went there when only 30 people were ahead of me (I started the waitlist at 145 people ahead of me). When we arrived we waited about five minutes before we were seated! That was awesome, because the line to get in this place was insane! I felt like VIP cutting the line. "Move out the way, the Queen is here" is something I may or may not have thought while being seated.Once we were seated I was immediately disappointed. This is a no frills diner. Equivalent to IHOP or Denny's. I was expecting a little more but whatever, I figured the food is why the people are lined up to get in this place. The food arrives and while it looked good, it was just....meh! Actually I take that back, the pancakes were amazing! However, the rest of the breakfast left no real impression. I suppose that is the downside of being a Yelper. You read all these amazing reviews and set high expectations only to be disappointed. I think this place is overrated. I wouldn't bat an eyelash at the thought of coming back here.<p>    </div>            <div itemprop="review" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">        <meta itemprop="author" content="Mai L.">        <div itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating">            <meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="4.0">        </div>        <meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-11-14">        <p itemprop="description">Tried the butchers block, which was full of meatthis was okended up taking leftovers home i feel like it tasted better laterwe added a side of specialty pancakes for +$2 or somethingI'm not the biggest fan of pancakes (I usually prefer savory breakfast foods)but they were damn good hereThe signature berry bliss pancakes were SO GOOD!I don't normally like pancakes but these were y u m mI'm sure the waffles would be amazing as wellit's a plus that you can add yourself to the waitlist on yelp to minimize your wait time too!<p>    </div>            <div itemprop="review" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">        <meta itemprop="author" content="Wanchen V.">        <div itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating">            <meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="5.0">        </div>        <meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-11-18">        <p itemprop="description">This is my new favorite brunch place! My all time favorite has been tre kronor but I think Wildberry is getting up there. We came on a Sunday morning and it was 30 mins wait by 8 am. Glad we used yelp to be on the waitlist. It's worth the wait! They have amazing pancakes with creative topping/cream. The skillets and eggs are done well. Oh of course, they serve the intelligentsia coffee! I'm glad they have a few locations that we can go to. Otherwise, I'm going to dream about these amazing pancakes every weekend.<p>    </div>            <div itemprop="review" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">        <meta itemprop="author" content="Joanna W.">        <div itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating">            <meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="5.0">        </div>        <meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-11-16">        <p itemprop="description">A good breakfast place isn't just about the great food, but also about the great variety. I loved coming here because there was something for everyone with such a large menu. More importantly, everything was superb regardless of what we ordered!I was told to try the berries pancake and it did not disappoint. Look at that sauce! It was decadent and filling - and oh so pretty :)I also tried the eggs benedict and for the first time in a while, i got two perfectly poached eggs. The hollandaise sauce was great as well - honestly the large portion of everything also meant i was stuffed and still wasn't able to finish my plate.We also tried the smoothies, juices, and latte. All of which were up to standards for my friends and I.If you're looking for a great breakfast spot to hit before checking out cloud gate (right across the street!), this is definitely it. Might even have a bit of a wait, but it was worth it for a great way to start the day!<p>    </div>            <div itemprop="review" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">        <meta itemprop="author" content="Dominique R.">        <div itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating">            <meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="4.0">        </div>        <meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-12-01">        <p itemprop="description">There are many locations throughout Chicago but this one was the closest to me. I ordered the Red Velvet French Toast and it was definitely for a sugar rush. The French toast was amazing with cream cheese frosting that was drizzled all over them. I poured a little syrup over the toast because they were already sweet for me. In order to speed up the process of waiting in line, I would check into line on the Yelp app which will give you an exact time of how long it will take for you to get a table. Just be ready to wait on the weekends since this place gets packed.<p>    </div>            <div itemprop="review" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">        <meta itemprop="author" content="Bell A.">        <div itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating">            <meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="5.0">        </div>        <meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-10-30">        <p itemprop="description">Update: you know how you update your review and either raise or lower your score? Well I'm going to leave Wildberry at a five because that's how awesome it is. Actually, take my previous five, add my current five and make it a ten. I went back the following day like I said I would and was greeted by the lovely hostesses with "you're back!" Of course, I can't get enough. So this time I wanted both breakfast and lunch. I ordered the turkey pepper jack panini with sweet potato fries and a "little berry" order of the berry bliss pancakes. The berry bliss pancakes will change your life and have you second guessing if you should order any other type of pancake. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure all of them are great. But this was is extra extra great. And so was my turkey panini! I was stuffed and couldn't finish it all. Just wishing I could pack up Wildberry and bring it back to Baltimore with it. ------------------------------------------------Currently kicking myself for ordering the most basic item on the menu: egg white omelet with pepper jack cheese, plain pancakes and turkey bacon. Don't get me wrong, everything tasted great. Actually more than great. Actually so good, I'm planning my visit back before I leave Chicago. I got there a little bit before closing and the restaurant was packed but I was still seated within 15 minutes. My server was great as well. Can't wait to come back!<p>    </div>            <div itemprop="review" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">        <meta itemprop="author" content="Jason A.">        <div itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating">            <meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="5.0">        </div>        <meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-11-09">        <p itemprop="description">Lets me start off my saying this place was all the reviews raved about!From good service to amazing food, I would not second guess myself on giving this place 5 stars. My only tip to people planning on visiting this place for breakfast is to get there early or put yourself on the waiting list before you leave your hotel. My girlfriend and I got there at around 7:30. Upon arriving, we made our way through the revolving door and was welcomed by a huge amount of people waiting by the entrance to escape the cold, brisk morning air. After putting my girlfriend and I on the waiting list, I received a text confirming that we were added to the list and would be notified when to come back to the restaurant. Considering this place was across from Millennium Park, we walked over to kill time -which in my opinion was great because there was no one at The Cloud so it was a great time to take pictures.About 40 minutes later, my girlfriend received a text to make our way back to the restaurant. Once we checked in with the hostess, we waited another 5 minutes. Once we were seated, we were greeted by a very nice waitress who asked us what we would like to drink as we also asked what she would recommend. She was very knowledgable in terms of product knowledge. Okay- lets get on to the food. All you need to do is look at the picture attached. It says it all. The food looked as good as it tasted. Highly recommend upgrading your side to the speciality pancakes! They are delicious!  Everything about this place was great from the service, to the food, to the turn over time (the waiters are so quick to clean tables and take away your empty plates).Thank you Wildberry for an amazing breakfast experience in Chicago.<p>    </div>            <div itemprop="review" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">        <meta itemprop="author" content="Simone T.">        <div itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating">            <meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="4.0">        </div>        <meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-11-25">        <p itemprop="description">Despite the inevitable wait (due to its location downtown) you'll have here, DO IT.

On our way over we joined the wait list via Yelp, wait time? 1 hr 45 minutes, holy...Took us 20 minutes to get there, squeezed past the crowds to check in, and the hostess told us they will text when ready. Luckily, you have the beautiful Millennium Park across the street to sight see, play tourist, work up an appetite, and kill time.Text came in which gave me 5 minutes to get to the front. Little did they know, I was already there. LOL Checked in once again and stood there waiting to be seated- 3 more parties ahead but all got seated quickly.Service is fast, there are many servers, bus boys, and hostess. Workers are very efficient and good at their job, which keeps the patrons flowing.Now to the juicy part, the FOOD:1) Corned Beef Hash Skillet- 5 stars! The corned beef is homemade. Comes with hash browns or fruit, toast or pancakes (but sub with the Berry Bliss Waffle +$5 but well worth it bc a seperate waffle order will cost you $13).  The corned beef hash was so deliciously flavored, tender, minced, and yet still had a little crunch factor from the mixed in hash.2) Berry Bliss Waffle- 5+ stars, this dish beats most waffles I've ever eaten. I was very full after finishing my benedicts, but knew I needed to try this beautiful waffle. I ended up eating half the waffle and wanted to order more regardless of how full I was. My boyfriend talked some sense into me and I sadly agreed.2. Florence Benedict- 5 stars, loaded with spinach and bacon bites, topped with a perfectly poached egg, and dressed with a very nice, creamy hollandaise sauce with a hint of lemon.Double espresso-strong and flavorfulOrange juice- freshly squeezed!<p>    </div>            <div itemprop="review" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">        <meta itemprop="author" content="Diego M.">        <div itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating">            <meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="5.0">        </div>        <meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-11-06">        <p itemprop="description">Bottom line: great breakfast/ lunch spot, goLong line: had a great time here.

The downtown location does not allow customers to stand in the commercial building the restaurant is connected to. With that being said, customers are supposed to wait outside if there is no room in the restaurant. Waiting for food in cold weather is not fun at all. So imagine standing in the commercial building being yelled at by security to stand outside. Not fun, not fun at all. However, once you get a seat the food and service is great.<p>    </div>            <div itemprop="review" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review">        <meta itemprop="author" content="Darla E.">        <div itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating">            <meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="5.0">        </div>        <meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-10-21">        <p itemprop="description">I went here for an early breakfast while visiting Chicago. I think it's going to be a regular spot for me whenever I'm in town. I unfortunately can't remember our waitress's name but she was really good, quirky and attentive without being annoying. On to my favorite, the food!I ordered the corned beef hash, made in house along with two over easy eggs and a berry bliss crepe. It was so good I'm actually thinking about driving back to Chicago right now as I write this review. I could eat like this everyday! It was a perfect meal, savory and crunchy from the corned beef; sweet and fluffy from the crepe.

It was truly difficult to squeeze by people on a rainy Chicago Saturday and we had to catch a flight. Can't recall the wait time, but it was significant and we knew heading to another establishment would result in waiting plus travel time any way.<br><br>Nevertheless, we made it in. Grabbed the regular two eggs any style breakfast with eggs overeasy and Applewood bacon. I wanted those specialty pancakes, but not just on its own. So chose the signature berry bliss.<br><br>When it came, I was pretty sure I wouldn't finish the whole meal. The bacon was crisp and the eggs done as ordered. Then the indulgent magic of the berry bliss. Wow. Jam-packed with flavor. I had to bow out after eating barely half of it. So good.

While the food was good, I'm not sure if it was worth the 45 minute wait.<br><br>We got the Slow Roast Brisket Hash (brisket, roasted red peppers, onions, and sausage gravy served with two eggs on a bed of potatoes and a side of toast) and the Mexicana Sizzlin' Skillet (hashbrowns, cheddar & peppejack cheese, two eggs, chorizo sausage, roasted jalapenos, avocado, cilantro, and onions). <br>The skillet came with a side of pancakes, so we substituted for a specialty pancake for an extra $2. The Signature Berry Bliss pancakes (fresh berries, jam, and marscapone cheese) was so worth it! <br>We weren't too thrilled with the brisket hash, but the skillet was really, really good.<br><br>For coffee, we got the Honey Toffee Nut Latte and Vanilla Berry Latte. Both were too sweet for our liking, and they served them to us in paper cups so there was no latte art. I'd recommend skipping the fancy lattes and just going for regular drip coffee here.</p>                                 <ul class="photo-box-grid clearfix js-content-expandable lightbox-media-parent" data-ad-logging-csrf="e36bba8d399fc83fb801eb3de024f7d89c4a9e94d559365dd4c12c951a1555f3" data-ad-logging-uri="/ad_acknowledgment" data-ga-path="media_lightbox/servlet:biz_details/type:biz" data-logging-csrf="4e3a479671cea01b2f54047a9039d6c95a5f4fdab71d30377968d296b4c974a0" data-logging-uri="/biz_photos/cKZNbMvoqJaUe7n6lf6i7w/log_views" data-media-count="4" data-media-url="/biz_photos/get_media_slice/cKZNbMvoqJaUe7n6lf6i7w?reviewid=Xz2zvkRZ1_4Qzpe6jp7Efw" data-starting-index="0">                <li style="width: 348px; height: 348px;">                        <div class="photo-box photo-box--interactive is-loading" data-photo-id=WNM_V9pDhDV9AVMasmcQEQ>                        <img data-async-src=https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WNM_V9pDhDV9AVMasmcQEQ/348s.jpg alt="Photo of Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe - Chicago, IL, United States.

Overall, the pancakes were delicious but the skillets left much to be desired. We ordered the Barbacoa Chilaquiles skillet, the Garden skillet, and a side of wildberry and blueberry pancakes. The Barbacoa was flavorful, but some bites were EXTREMELY spicy. They may have unevenly spread the spices and it became a bit unbearable to eat without taking water breaks. The Garden skillet, however, was entirely opposite. I'm talking NO spices what so ever. It left me extremely confused... they were sautéed veggies with an egg on top. That's quite literally it. It was as bland as you could get. Do not recommend!<br><br>As far as pancakes, they were both rich, creamy, and not overpoweringly sweet. Great choices. There's a reason the restaurants name isn't Wildberry Skillets, so choose accordingly...</p>                                 <ul class="photo-box-grid clearfix js-content-expandable lightbox-media-parent" data-ad-logging-csrf="e36bba8d399fc83fb801eb3de024f7d89c4a9e94d559365dd4c12c951a1555f3" data-ad-logging-uri="/ad_acknowledgment" data-ga-path="media_lightbox/servlet:biz_details/type:biz" data-logging-csrf="4e3a479671cea01b2f54047a9039d6c95a5f4fdab71d30377968d296b4c974a0" data-logging-uri="/biz_photos/cKZNbMvoqJaUe7n6lf6i7w/log_views" data-media-count="4" data-media-url="/biz_photos/get_media_slice/cKZNbMvoqJaUe7n6lf6i7w?reviewid=glNO9qcZVpIW2fQyNXT2HQ" data-starting-index="0">                <li style="width: 348px; height: 348px;">                        <div class="photo-box photo-box--interactive is-loading" data-photo-id=DIjJp4cwQaV_ISwW_GeVaQ>                        <img data-async-src=https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DIjJp4cwQaV_ISwW_GeVaQ/348s.jpg alt="Photo of Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe - Chicago, IL, United States.

They close at 2:30pm and we barely made it just before 2pm. I ordered the Wild Mushroom Omelette which was really good. I upgrade my pancakes for just $2 to the Signature Berry Bliss pancakes. I don't usually get pancakes at brunch but this was a good decision ! My boyfriend got the Homemade Corned Beef Hash Skillet which he really liked. He upgraded the pancakes for the Chocolate Banana Bread French Toast. We both really liked this as well. It's definitely on the sweeter side but since it was just half an order, it wasn't too overwhelming. I also tried a little bit of the Oreo S'mores Pancakes and that was way too sweet for me. <br><br>The service was phenomenal here. Our waiter constantly checked up on us and refilled our drinks. He was very energetic and friendly towards us which I appreciate. I will definitely come back here for brunch!</p>                                 <ul class="photo-box-grid clearfix js-content-expandable lightbox-media-parent" data-ad-logging-csrf="e36bba8d399fc83fb801eb3de024f7d89c4a9e94d559365dd4c12c951a1555f3" data-ad-logging-uri="/ad_acknowledgment" data-ga-path="media_lightbox/servlet:biz_details/type:biz" data-logging-csrf="4e3a479671cea01b2f54047a9039d6c95a5f4fdab71d30377968d296b4c974a0" data-logging-uri="/biz_photos/cKZNbMvoqJaUe7n6lf6i7w/log_views" data-media-count="9" data-media-url="/biz_photos/get_media_slice/cKZNbMvoqJaUe7n6lf6i7w?reviewid=wCAxrHvJRWVMGpuIoesM4w" data-starting-index="0">                <li style="width: 348px; height: 348px;">                        <div class="photo-box photo-box--interactive is-loading" data-photo-id=MIFRNlpc-EiWzRokSi694w>                        <img data-async-src=https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MIFRNlpc-EiWzRokSi694w/348s.jpg alt="Photo of Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe - Chicago, IL, United States" class="photo-box-img no-js-hidden" height="348" src="https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/978c1bee49d7/assets/img/1x1.png" width="348">            <noscript>                    <img alt="Photo of Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe - Chicago, IL, United States" class="photo-box-img" height="348" src="https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MIFRNlpc-EiWzRokSi694w/348s.jpg" srcset="https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MIFRNlpc-EiWzRokSi694w/1000s.jpg 2.87x" width="348">            </noscript>                    <a class="biz-shim js-lightbox-media-link js-analytics-click" data-analytics-label="biz-photo"  href="/biz_photos/wildberry-pancakes-and-cafe-chicago-2?reviewid=wCAxrHvJRWVMGpuIoesM4w&select=MIFRNlpc-EiWzRokSi694w">            <span class="offscreen"></span>    </a>    </div>                </li>                <li style="width: 168px; height: 168px;">                        <div class="photo-box photo-box--interactive is-loading" data-photo-id=wdLuURKXPhkUUnFkJP00fg>                        <img data-async-src=https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wdLuURKXPhkUUnFkJP00fg/168s.jpg alt="Photo of Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe - Chicago, IL, United States.

Simply incredible. <br><br>First things first, hop in line on the Yelp app and make your way there around that time. And then wait a little longer..You can even wait in a building adjacent to them to stay warm/dry during inclement days. They have four friendly faces to greet you inside the door and then shoot you a text when you should come inside to wait and then holler your name when its time to be seated. We were shown to our table ana greeted by our waitress promptly. She took our drink order and quickly re-appeared with some of the best coffee I have had at a breakfast restaurant. <br><br>I inquired with her about which pancake they were most known for and she immediately retorted with the wild berry and cinnamon roll.  With that knowledge in mind I ordered the Mexican Skillet and the Wild Berry Pancake on the side. My sister ordered an omelette with the cinnamon roll pancakes so we could all try each others. <br><br>My skillet was to die for. I ordered it without jalapenos and it was incredible. The chorizo was so flavorful and everything was mixed just perfectly. The melted the cheese, the avocado...YUM! And not to mention it fed me breakfast for TWO days because it was massive. And I am happy to report it is equally as good on day two. My mom and sister both really enjoyed their omelettes and the fruit that came with my moms was very obviously fresh which is a nice change. And none of us could decide which pancake we liked more. So all in all we got to try so many things and everything was hot, fresh, and delicious. I cannot wait to get back and try even more!</p>                                 <ul class="photo-box-grid clearfix js-content-expandable lightbox-media-parent" data-ad-logging-csrf="e36bba8d399fc83fb801eb3de024f7d89c4a9e94d559365dd4c12c951a1555f3" data-ad-logging-uri="/ad_acknowledgment" data-ga-path="media_lightbox/servlet:biz_details/type:biz" data-logging-csrf="4e3a479671cea01b2f54047a9039d6c95a5f4fdab71d30377968d296b4c974a0" data-logging-uri="/biz_photos/cKZNbMvoqJaUe7n6lf6i7w/log_views" data-media-count="3" data-media-url="/biz_photos/get_media_slice/cKZNbMvoqJaUe7n6lf6i7w?reviewid=xaOnET0jYkO7A1GL6768hw" data-starting-index="0">                <li style="width: 348px;

We signed up to get on their wait list and were seated in 45 minutes on a Saturday late morning. Instead of waiting outside and getting hangry, we decided to spend that time hanging around the bean, which was very close - so I suggest doing that if you have a long wait!<br><br>I shared the Mexicana skillet served with a side of"signature berry bliss" pancakes! I absolutely loved the Mexicana skillet - the saltiness of the chorizo and spicy/freshness of jalapeños were really good with the hash browns, which were on the blander side. Having the eggs cooked over easy was the right move because the yolk running through all the components in the skillet really made this dish! <br><br>The berry bliss pancakes on the other hand, were a little disappointing. I thought the pancakes were a bit tough and I didn't like the drizzle on top. It tasted too tangy for me. <br><br>Overall, my friends had a great experience at Wildberry. The staff was very friendly, food was great, and portions were HUGE. Come hungry!</p>                                 <ul class="photo-box-grid clearfix js-content-expandable lightbox-media-parent" data-ad-logging-csrf="e36bba8d399fc83fb801eb3de024f7d89c4a9e94d559365dd4c12c951a1555f3" data-ad-logging-uri="/ad_acknowledgment" data-ga-path="media_lightbox/servlet:biz_details/type:biz" data-logging-csrf="4e3a479671cea01b2f54047a9039d6c95a5f4fdab71d30377968d296b4c974a0" data-logging-uri="/biz_photos/cKZNbMvoqJaUe7n6lf6i7w/log_views" data-media-count="3" data-media-url="/biz_photos/get_media_slice/cKZNbMvoqJaUe7n6lf6i7w?reviewid=qKZpqq74YC9EzAYYabeMgg" data-starting-index="0">                <li style="width: 348px; height: 348px;">                        <div class="photo-box photo-box--interactive is-loading" data-photo-id=AONyQ_oXs5Xwl4yhdGvs3Q>                        <img data-async-src=https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AONyQ_oXs5Xwl4yhdGvs3Q/348s.jpg alt="Photo of Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe - Chicago, IL, United States.

Across the street from Millennium Park on Randolph is tough to beat. This place is always jammed packed with tourist. <br><br>I worked in the same building as Wildberry for 6 years and was a regular because of the convenience. I've tried just about every item on the menu. To avoid the long wait, we'd often place to-go orders.<br><br>While I'd never had a bad meal, I think Wildberry is on par with just about any slightly above average breakfast restaurant. I guess it depends on what you like. I'm not a big fan of Yolk or The Bongo Room. Wildberry is on the same plane.<br><br>I actually prefer the lunch options over breakfast. The burger is seraphic when not overcooked. The havarti cheese and onion jam are the perfect accompaniment. <br><br>Long story short. .. Wildberry is fine, but there are better options in the area and countless more if you explore other neighborhoods.</p>                                 <ul class="photo-box-grid clearfix js-content-expandable lightbox-media-parent" data-ad-logging-csrf="e36bba8d399fc83fb801eb3de024f7d89c4a9e94d559365dd4c12c951a1555f3" data-ad-logging-uri="/ad_acknowledgment" data-ga-path="media_lightbox/servlet:biz_details/type:biz" data-logging-csrf="4e3a479671cea01b2f54047a9039d6c95a5f4fdab71d30377968d296b4c974a0" data-logging-uri="/biz_photos/cKZNbMvoqJaUe7n6lf6i7w/log_views" data-media-count="7" data-media-url="/biz_photos/get_media_slice/cKZNbMvoqJaUe7n6lf6i7w?reviewid=H0JHaICmS0dhgH9OUSPDng" data-starting-index="0">                <li style="width: 348px; height: 348px;">                        <div class="photo-box photo-box--interactive is-loading" data-photo-id=VfwHCD26_qaUzFxD-5KNUg>                        <img data-async-src=https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VfwHCD26_qaUzFxD-5KNUg/348s.jpg alt="Photo of Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe - Chicago, IL, United States.

Oh no, that's always the beginning of some angry Yelpers review. I am not angry though, I am just kind of......meh, for lack of a better term of what I feel for Wildberry. <br><br>I read all the raving reviews and saw the waitlist and I knew I had to check this place out. Kudos, to my fellow Yelpers for letting me know about the waitlist. I literally put myself on it from the comfort of my hotel and went there when only 30 people were ahead of me (I started the waitlist at 145 people ahead of me). When we arrived we waited about five minutes before we were seated! That was awesome, because the line to get in this place was insane! I felt like VIP cutting the line. "Move out the way, the Queen is here" is something I may or may not have thought while being seated.<br><br>Once we were seated I was immediately disappointed. This is a no frills diner. Equivalent to IHOP or Denny's. I was expecting a little more but whatever, I figured the food is why the people are lined up to get in this place. <br><br>The food arrives and while it looked good, it was just....meh! Actually I take that back, the pancakes were amazing! However, the rest of the breakfast left no real impression. <br><br>I suppose that is the downside of being a Yelper. You read all these amazing reviews and set high expectations only to be disappointed. I think this place is overrated. I wouldn't bat an eyelash at the thought of coming back here.</p>                                 <ul class="photo-box-grid clearfix js-content-expandable lightbox-media-parent" data-ad-logging-csrf="e36bba8d399fc83fb801eb3de024f7d89c4a9e94d559365dd4c12c951a1555f3" data-ad-logging-uri="/ad_acknowledgment" data-ga-path="media_lightbox/servlet:biz_details/type:biz" data-logging-csrf="4e3a479671cea01b2f54047a9039d6c95a5f4fdab71d30377968d296b4c974a0" data-logging-uri="/biz_photos/cKZNbMvoqJaUe7n6lf6i7w/log_views" data-media-count="4" data-media-url="/biz_photos/get_media_slice/cKZNbMvoqJaUe7n6lf6i7w?reviewid=i5IaUe65QE8bUWrKQj9bkA" data-starting-index="0">                <li style="width: 348px; height: 348px;">                        <div class="photo-box photo-box--interactive is-loading" data-photo-id=f66FBAxVd69k9zMu0sIUwg>                        <img data-async-src=https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/f66FBAxVd69k9zMu0sIUwg/348s.jpg alt="Photo of Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe - Chicago, IL, United States.

I loved coming here because there was something for everyone with such a large menu. More importantly, everything was superb regardless of what we ordered!<br><br>I was told to try the berries pancake and it did not disappoint. Look at that sauce! It was decadent and filling - and oh so pretty :)<br><br>I also tried the eggs benedict and for the first time in a while, i got two perfectly poached eggs. The hollandaise sauce was great as well - honestly the large portion of everything also meant i was stuffed and still wasn't able to finish my plate.<br><br>We also tried the smoothies, juices, and latte. All of which were up to standards for my friends and I.<br><br>If you're looking for a great breakfast spot to hit before checking out cloud gate (right across the street!), this is definitely it.

Well I'm going to leave Wildberry at a five because that's how awesome it is. Actually, take my previous five, add my current five and make it a ten. <br><br>I went back the following day like I said I would and was greeted by the lovely hostesses with "you're back!" Of course, I can't get enough. <br><br>So this time I wanted both breakfast and lunch. I ordered the turkey pepper jack panini with sweet potato fries and a "little berry" order of the berry bliss pancakes. <br><br>The berry bliss pancakes will change your life and have you second guessing if you should order any other type of pancake. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure all of them are great. But this was is extra extra great. And so was my turkey panini! I was stuffed and couldn't finish it all. <br><br>Just wishing I could pack up Wildberry and bring it back to Baltimore with it. <br><br>------------------------------------------------<br><br>Currently kicking myself for ordering the most basic item on the menu: egg white omelet with pepper jack cheese, plain pancakes and turkey bacon. Don't get me wrong, everything tasted great. Actually more than great. Actually so good, I'm planning my visit back before I leave Chicago. <br><br>I got there a little bit before closing and the restaurant was packed but I was still seated within 15 minutes. <br><br>My server was great as well. Can't wait to come back!</p>                                 <ul class="photo-box-grid clearfix js-content-expandable lightbox-media-parent" data-ad-logging-csrf="e36bba8d399fc83fb801eb3de024f7d89c4a9e94d559365dd4c12c951a1555f3" data-ad-logging-uri="/ad_acknowledgment" data-ga-path="media_lightbox/servlet:biz_details/type:biz" data-logging-csrf="4e3a479671cea01b2f54047a9039d6c95a5f4fdab71d30377968d296b4c974a0" data-logging-uri="/biz_photos/cKZNbMvoqJaUe7n6lf6i7w/log_views" data-media-count="3" data-media-url="/biz_photos/get_media_slice/cKZNbMvoqJaUe7n6lf6i7w?reviewid=3tQkRwBi8h-LOz0EMKshkQ" data-starting-index="0">                <li style="width: 348px;

My only tip to people planning on visiting this place for breakfast is to get there early or put yourself on the waiting list before you leave your hotel. <br><br>My girlfriend and I got there at around 7:30. Upon arriving, we made our way through the revolving door and was welcomed by a huge amount of people waiting by the entrance to escape the cold, brisk morning air. After putting my girlfriend and I on the waiting list, I received a text confirming that we were added to the list and would be notified when to come back to the restaurant. Considering this place was across from Millennium Park, we walked over to kill time -which in my opinion was great because there was no one at The Cloud so it was a great time to take pictures.<br><br>About 40 minutes later, my girlfriend received a text to make our way back to the restaurant. Once we checked in with the hostess, we waited another 5 minutes. Once we were seated, we were greeted by a very nice waitress who asked us what we would like to drink as we also asked what she would recommend. She was very knowledgable in terms of product knowledge. <br><br>Okay- lets get on to the food. All you need to do is look at the picture attached. It says it all. The food looked as good as it tasted. <br><br>Highly recommend upgrading your side to the speciality pancakes! They are delicious!  Everything about this place was great from the service, to the food, to the turn over time (the waiters are so quick to clean tables and take away your empty plates).<br><br>Thank you Wildberry for an amazing breakfast experience in Chicago.</p>                                 <ul class="photo-box-grid clearfix js-content-expandable lightbox-media-parent" data-ad-logging-csrf="e36bba8d399fc83fb801eb3de024f7d89c4a9e94d559365dd4c12c951a1555f3" data-ad-logging-uri="/ad_acknowledgment" data-ga-path="media_lightbox/servlet:biz_details/type:biz" data-logging-csrf="4e3a479671cea01b2f54047a9039d6c95a5f4fdab71d30377968d296b4c974a0" data-logging-uri="/biz_photos/cKZNbMvoqJaUe7n6lf6i7w/log_views" data-media-count="1" data-media-url="/biz_photos/get_media_slice/cKZNbMvoqJaUe7n6lf6i7w?reviewid=w9OyQw34_QI9ouJf-94dTw" data-starting-index="0">                <li style="width: 348px; height: 348px;">                        <div class="photo-box photo-box--interactive is-loading" data-photo-id=X0iWtjjDNKHQgVTbUpfuvw>                        <img data-async-src=https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/X0iWtjjDNKHQgVTbUpfuvw/348s.jpg alt="Photo of Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe - Chicago, IL, United States" class="photo-box-img no-js-hidden" height="348" src="https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/978c1bee49d7/assets/img/1x1.png" width="348">            <noscript>                    <img alt="Photo of Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe - Chicago, IL, United States" class="photo-box-img" height="348" src="https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/X0iWtjjDNKHQgVTbUpfuvw/348s.jpg" srcset="https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/X0iWtjjDNKHQgVTbUpfuvw/1000s.jpg 2.87x" width="348">            </noscript>                    <a class="biz-shim js-lightbox-media-link js-analytics-click" data-analytics-label="biz-photo"  href="/biz_photos/wildberry-pancakes-and-cafe-chicago-2?reviewid=w9OyQw34_QI9ouJf-94dTw&select=X0iWtjjDNKHQgVTbUpfuvw">            <span class="offscreen"></span>    </a>    </div>                </li>        </ul>    </div>        <div class="review-footer clearfix">                    <div class="rateReview voting-feedback" data-review-id="w9OyQw34_QI9ouJf-94dTw" data-origin="biz_details_review_feed">                    <p class="voting-intro voting-prompt">            Was this review …?    </p>    <ul class="voting-buttons" data-csrf-token="a7b1f2d4ad68d5552c66cc490cc1b05cc1cd0e08a58abb505fd9076378090da9">                <li class="vote-item inline-block">    <a class="ybtn ybtn--small useful js-analytics-click" data-analytics-label="ufc" href="javascript:;" rel="useful">            <span aria-hidden="true" style="width: 18px; height: 18px;" class="icon icon--18-useful-outline icon--size-18 icon--currentColor button-content u-space-r-half">    <svg role="img" class="icon_svg">        <use xlink:href="#18x18_useful_outline" />    </svg></span>    <span class="vote-type">Useful</span>    <span class="count"></span>    </a>    </li>                <li class="vote-item inline-block">    <a class="ybtn ybtn--small funny js-analytics-click" data-analytics-label="ufc" href="javascript:;" rel="funny">            <span aria-hidden="true" style="width: 18px; height: 18px;" class="icon icon--18-funny-outline icon--size-18 icon--currentColor button-content u-space-r-half">    <svg role="img" class="icon_svg">        <use xlink:href="#18x18_funny_outline" />    </svg></span>    <span class="vote-type">Funny</span>    <span class="count"></span>    </a>    </li>                <li class="vote-item inline-block">    <a class="ybtn ybtn--small cool js-analytics-click" data-analytics-label="ufc" href="javascript:;" rel="cool">            <span aria-hidden="true" style="width: 18px; height: 18px;" class="icon icon--18-cool-outline icon--size-18 icon--currentColor button-content u-space-r-half">    <svg role="img" class="icon_svg">        <use xlink:href="#18x18_cool_outline" />    </svg></span>    <span class="vote-type">Cool</span>    <span class="count"></span>    </a>    </li>    </ul>    <div class="js-deanon-modal-container">            <div class="js-deanon-modal u-hidden">    <div class="modal_body">            <div class="u-text-centered u-space-t6 u-space-b6">                <h3 class="u-space-b3">Others will see how you vote!</h3>                <div class="u-space-b3">                    <img src="https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png">                </div>                <div class="u-space-b2" style="width:76%;margin:auto;">                    Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

You won't be disappointed. I recommend you get on their text check-in in advance. This establishment serves breakfast, brunch, and lunch, closing at 3pm. The portions are VERY filling/hearty, and considering the location, the prices are excellent. Very attentive and friendly staff. Great pancakes!</p>                                 <ul class="photo-box-grid clearfix js-content-expandable lightbox-media-parent" data-ad-logging-csrf="e36bba8d399fc83fb801eb3de024f7d89c4a9e94d559365dd4c12c951a1555f3" data-ad-logging-uri="/ad_acknowledgment" data-ga-path="media_lightbox/servlet:biz_details/type:biz" data-logging-csrf="4e3a479671cea01b2f54047a9039d6c95a5f4fdab71d30377968d296b4c974a0" data-logging-uri="/biz_photos/cKZNbMvoqJaUe7n6lf6i7w/log_views" data-media-count="3" data-media-url="/biz_photos/get_media_slice/cKZNbMvoqJaUe7n6lf6i7w?reviewid=r52IWjVOLhldFItH3KWwXA" data-starting-index="0">                <li style="width: 348px;

On our way over we joined the wait list via Yelp, wait time? 1 hr 45 minutes, holy...<br><br>Took us 20 minutes to get there, squeezed past the crowds to check in, and the hostess told us they will text when ready. Luckily, you have the beautiful Millennium Park across the street to sight see, play tourist, work up an appetite, and kill time.<br><br>Text came in which gave me 5 minutes to get to the front. Little did they know, I was already there. LOL Checked in once again and stood there waiting to be seated- 3 more parties ahead but all got seated quickly.<br><br>Service is fast, there are many servers, bus boys, and hostess. Workers are very efficient and good at their job, which keeps the patrons flowing.<br><br>Now to the juicy part, the FOOD:<br><br>1) Corned Beef Hash Skillet- 5 stars! The corned beef is homemade. Comes with hash browns or fruit, toast or pancakes (but sub with the Berry Bliss Waffle +$5 but well worth it bc a seperate waffle order will cost you $13).  The corned beef hash was so deliciously flavored, tender, minced, and yet still had a little crunch factor from the mixed in hash.<br><br>2) Berry Bliss Waffle- 5+ stars, this dish beats most waffles I've ever eaten. I was very full after finishing my benedicts, but knew I needed to try this beautiful waffle. I ended up eating half the waffle and wanted to order more regardless of how full I was. My boyfriend talked some sense into me and I sadly agreed.<br><br>2. Florence Benedict- 5 stars, loaded with spinach and bacon bites, topped with a perfectly poached egg, and dressed with a very nice, creamy hollandaise sauce with a hint of lemon.<br><br>Double espresso-strong and flavorful<br><br>Orange juice- freshly squeezed!</p>                                 <ul class="photo-box-grid clearfix js-content-expandable lightbox-media-parent" data-ad-logging-csrf="e36bba8d399fc83fb801eb3de024f7d89c4a9e94d559365dd4c12c951a1555f3" data-ad-logging-uri="/ad_acknowledgment" data-ga-path="media_lightbox/servlet:biz_details/type:biz" data-logging-csrf="4e3a479671cea01b2f54047a9039d6c95a5f4fdab71d30377968d296b4c974a0" data-logging-uri="/biz_photos/cKZNbMvoqJaUe7n6lf6i7w/log_views" data-media-count="6" data-media-url="/biz_photos/get_media_slice/cKZNbMvoqJaUe7n6lf6i7w?reviewid=gz6asKrXc2xxDkqmlk6B3Q" data-starting-index="0">                <li style="width: 348px; height: 348px;">                        <div class="photo-box photo-box--interactive is-loading" data-photo-id=Pnkk5VWLIAouFU0YcdvoJA>                        <img data-async-src=https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Pnkk5VWLIAouFU0YcdvoJA/348s.jpg alt="Photo of Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe - Chicago, IL, United States.

The downtown location does not allow customers to stand in the commercial building the restaurant is connected to. With that being said, customers are supposed to wait outside if there is no room in the restaurant. Waiting for food in cold weather is not fun at all. So imagine standing in the commercial building being yelled at by security to stand outside. Not fun, not fun at all. <br><br>However, once you get a seat the food and service is great.</p>                 </div>        <div class="review-footer clearfix">                    <div class="rateReview voting-feedback" data-review-id="HdVdzJZbyLItF9mRRWWGng" data-origin="biz_details_review_feed">                    <p class="voting-intro voting-prompt">            Was this review …?    </p>    <ul class="voting-buttons" data-csrf-token="a7b1f2d4ad68d5552c66cc490cc1b05cc1cd0e08a58abb505fd9076378090da9">                <li class="vote-item inline-block">    <a class="ybtn ybtn--small useful js-analytics-click" data-analytics-label="ufc" href="javascript:;" rel="useful">            <span aria-hidden="true" style="width: 18px; height: 18px;" class="icon icon--18-useful-outline icon--size-18 icon--currentColor button-content u-space-r-half">    <svg role="img" class="icon_svg">        <use xlink:href="#18x18_useful_outline" />    </svg></span>    <span class="vote-type">Useful</span>    <span class="count"></span>    </a>    </li>                <li class="vote-item inline-block">    <a class="ybtn ybtn--small funny js-analytics-click" data-analytics-label="ufc" href="javascript:;" rel="funny">            <span aria-hidden="true" style="width: 18px; height: 18px;" class="icon icon--18-funny-outline icon--size-18 icon--currentColor button-content u-space-r-half">    <svg role="img" class="icon_svg">        <use xlink:href="#18x18_funny_outline" />    </svg></span>    <span class="vote-type">Funny</span>    <span class="count"></span>    </a>    </li>                <li class="vote-item inline-block">    <a class="ybtn ybtn--small cool js-analytics-click" data-analytics-label="ufc" href="javascript:;" rel="cool">            <span aria-hidden="true" style="width: 18px; height: 18px;" class="icon icon--18-cool-outline icon--size-18 icon--currentColor button-content u-space-r-half">    <svg role="img" class="icon_svg">        <use xlink:href="#18x18_cool_outline" />    </svg></span>    <span class="vote-type">Cool</span>    <span class="count"></span>    </a>    </li>    </ul>    <div class="js-deanon-modal-container">            <div class="js-deanon-modal u-hidden">    <div class="modal_body">            <div class="u-text-centered u-space-t6 u-space-b6">                <h3 class="u-space-b3">Others will see how you vote!</h3>                <div class="u-space-b3">                    <img src="https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png">                </div>                <div class="u-space-b2" style="width:76%;margin:auto;">                    Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I think it's going to be a regular spot for me whenever I'm in town. <br>I unfortunately can't remember our waitress's name but she was really good, quirky and attentive without being annoying. <br>On to my favorite, the food!<br>I ordered the corned beef hash, made in house along with two over easy eggs and a berry bliss crepe. It was so good I'm actually thinking about driving back to Chicago right now as I write this review. <br>I could eat like this everyday! It was a perfect meal, savory and crunchy from the corned beef; sweet and fluffy from the crepe. I left happy and can't wait to return.</p>                                 <ul class="photo-box-grid clearfix js-content-expandable lightbox-media-parent" data-ad-logging-csrf="e36bba8d399fc83fb801eb3de024f7d89c4a9e94d559365dd4c12c951a1555f3" data-ad-logging-uri="/ad_acknowledgment" data-ga-path="media_lightbox/servlet:biz_details/type:biz" data-logging-csrf="4e3a479671cea01b2f54047a9039d6c95a5f4fdab71d30377968d296b4c974a0" data-logging-uri="/biz_photos/cKZNbMvoqJaUe7n6lf6i7w/log_views" data-media-count="3" data-media-url="/biz_photos/get_media_slice/cKZNbMvoqJaUe7n6lf6i7w?reviewid=x6ZCxdd95CnTmPoOE0Peag" data-starting-index="0">                <li style="width: 348px; height: 348px;">                        <div class="photo-box photo-box--interactive is-loading" data-photo-id=PNDPREFMHU-ELMS-SPbS3A>                        <img data-async-src=https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PNDPREFMHU-ELMS-SPbS3A/348s.jpg alt="Photo of Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe - Chicago, IL, United States" class="photo-box-img no-js-hidden" height="348" src="https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/978c1bee49d7/assets/img/1x1.png" width="348">            <noscript>                    <img alt="Photo of Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe - Chicago, IL, United States" class="photo-box-img" height="348" src="https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PNDPREFMHU-ELMS-SPbS3A/348s.jpg" srcset="https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PNDPREFMHU-ELMS-SPbS3A/1000s.jpg 2.87x" width="348">            </noscript>                    <a class="biz-shim js-lightbox-media-link js-analytics-click" data-analytics-label="biz-photo"  href="/biz_photos/wildberry-pancakes-and-cafe-chicago-2?reviewid=x6ZCxdd95CnTmPoOE0Peag&select=PNDPREFMHU-ELMS-SPbS3A">            <span class="offscreen"></span>    </a>    </div>                </li>                <li style="width: 168px; height: 168px;">                        <div class="photo-box photo-box--interactive is-loading" data-photo-id=7GavSOSnew31IZDrqTpWaA>                        <img data-async-src=https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7GavSOSnew31IZDrqTpWaA/168s.jpg alt="Photo of Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe - Chicago, IL, United States.
