Â I always thought they were good but honestly event food isn't the same as eating the food fresh at a restaurant. We walked in and noticed the menu board had some items missing from the online menu. The guy taking our order said he could make anything for us even if it's missing. That's called customer service. I wanted the Mack Diddy Burger which has two parties along with cheese, shredded lettuce, pickle and thousand island sauce. The girls both ordered tacos. My wife wanted to carry out but I insisted that we dine in because fries and fish tacos don't travel well. <br><br>As we were waiting I noticed that several people who had ordered food after us were all getting their food. It seemed weird that people ordering burgers and the same tacos were passing us. I sent my wife up to the counter to ask if someone had taken our food. They apologized to my wife and informed her that the owner was having my burger remade because it wasn't right and he didn't want to send it out. Unfortunately our trufffle fries, samurai taco and el pastor taco were sitting under the heat lamp baking. They decided to give her the food that was already done. If she didn't go up there then her poor food would have still been sitting under the heating element. The truffle fries were not totally fresh and that's because they were sitting. I'm a fry snob and never order them for delivery. I need them hot and fresh out of the fryer. Part of me wanted to say something but I hate wasting food and understand the costs of running a restaurant. <br><br>The girls started to eat their tacos while I waited for my burger. My burger was finally done and when I went up to get it they apologized for the delay. Again great customer service. The burger looked amazing. It was simply beautiful. All I could think is what did it look like before the owner made the chef recook it. I took one bite and I was in love. This burger reminded me of going over to a friends backyard party and your buddy was grilling burgers. Then you tell your friend that he needs to quit his job and open up a restaurant. That's the metaphor that flew through my head after my first bite. These moments don't always happen to me but when they do they are a magical moment. The patties were clearly hand packed and the char on the edge of the meat was just fantastic. The bun was perfectly grilled too. The shredded lettuce, pickle and thousand island rounded out this perfection on a bun. This is one of those burgers that will stay in my head forever. I'm afraid to ever order it again because I'm scared it won't taste this good. I'm going to need the owner to be here every time before I order this burger to make sure it's always this amazing. <br><br>While we were eating our food they sent over two tacos for us to try. They wanted to apologize for the screwed up on the burger and our order not coming out together. I can never get mad at great customer service. Things happen in a restaurant and when the staff recognizes it and apologizes then it makes the dinning experience incredible. This might have been a four star review but I have total respect for this place and they deserve five stars. We are all human and saying I'm sorry goes a long way. It makes everything taste better. <br><br>We had a great dinner. What a perfect way to end a long work week. Thanks to the staff and owner for having great customer service. Also thanks for making me a burger that will be dancing in my dreams for weeks. I almost thought I made a mistake by not ordering tacos but now I may never have another taco here again.

I wish I had a bottomless stomach to keep eating. I could only eat half, but I loved having the leftovers. The porkbelly was tasty with great consistency because they finish off by frying, so you get the crispy in your mouth. <br><br>Salmon poke taco-mine came out room temperature. I don't know if that's normal, but room temperature raw fish isn't completely comforting. I ate it, it was delicious, and I didn't get sick.
