I recommend the smoked salmon, hand cut fries with garlic aioli, and the lobster roll.<br><br>The lobster roll is one of the best. It's stuffed with chunks of lump and claw meat that's been cooked to perfection and then chilled. It comes with drawn butter, mayonnaise, some old bay seasoning, and finished off with a liberal sprinkling of chopped chives. The roll itself is toasted to a magnificent golden brown, slightly crispy on the outside, while rich, soft and buttery on the inside. It comes with a side of fries, but I opted for their mixed greens salad tossed in a vinaigrette.<br><br>The smoked salmon is an interactive dish. You get slices of smoked salmon, Texas toast, sliced cucumber, pickled onions, Â chopped parsley, and a handful of capers. You build your own bite based off your own personal preference. I recommend you layer each item on top of the toast, starting with the salmon, then some cucumbers and onions, and finish off with some capers. The salmon is fresh, buttery and has a velvety texture. The sharp saltiness of the capers pairs really well with the rich and buttery flavors of everything else.<br><br>The hand cut fries are fresh, piping hot and crispy. You have to get it with the truffle aioli. Unlike other places that use truffle oil, you get real pieces of black truffle here. The aroma of fresh truffle combined with the aioli is absolutely divine.<br><br>Service is fairly good here. They're attentive without being intrusive. The main draw of this place is the decor and overall ambiance of the atrium. You have a large central fountain flanked by large Heritage olive trees. There are also some gorgeous chandeliers to provide some extra light in addition to the copious amounts of natural light that floods the space courtesy of the clear roof. There are some 2 seat tables surrounding the fountain and large communal couches for larger parties.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I felt that the food was priced steeply for what it was, but there is absolutely no denying that this is one of the most beautiful restaurants in Chicago.<br><br>3 Arts has an indoor decor that is unmatched through the city and if you're looking for a place to catch up with someone over a cup of coffee or a light bite to eat, this is a great place.<br><br>The restaurant defines the word ambience.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "One of my favorite places in Chicago!!! <br>Do not skip out on going here if you have the opportunity. Unfortunately, they do not take reservations which could make for a long wait on the weekends.

The atrium is gorgeous and you're surrounded by exposed brick, beautiful plants, a giant sparkling chandelier and a water fountain in the center of it all.<br>We were seated in two plush arm chairs with a perfect view of all the decor and immediately knew we had to order some champagne. I mean really, this place makes you feel like royalty.<br>Our server was very sweet and friendly as she asked if we'd been there before and offered to explain the menu to us. We started with the delice de bourgogne cheese plate with crusty warm bread, sweet preserves and candied pecans. If this was all I ate while I was here... I would have been more than satisfied. The portion is so worth the price and it was some of the creamiest cheese that's ever crossed my lips. I've been dreaming of this cheese since I left, seriously.<br>For an entree I ordered the turkey club with hand cut fries. This isn't just your ordinary turkey club... it is an exceptional turkey club. You can actually taste the thick cuts of bacon and the quality of the turkey is excellent. Easily became one of my favorite sandwiches. And as if it couldn't get any better, the fries are amazing. I've read a few reviews that said the food is mediocre but I thought it was all very very good. <br><br>And of course part of the experience here is being able to walk around and explore all the different floors of Restoration Hardware full of furniture and decor. It's SO much fun.

The cafe itself is located within a Restoration Hardware, which has picturesque showrooms on each floor, including a rooftop garden. <br><br>Once we were seated, it was almost too distracting to order since we were all just in awe of the natural lighting and the centerpiece, restored water fountain that sat below a beautiful chandelier. The menu is pricey, but part of that is paying for the ambiance.<br><br>We started off with a smoked salmon platter to share with the table. For $25, you get 4 pieces of Texas toast, which replaces bagels for a spread of cucumber, pickled onions, capers, and cream cheese to be served with smoked salmon. The plate was as delicious as it was beautifully presented. For our meals, we tried the RH scramble and the RH granola and yogurt. I was surprised by how good the scramble was, and realized it was mixed well with creme fraiche for a slightly runny, but creamy texture. The granola and yogurt combo was very well-made and tasty. The $10 side of bacon comes with about 5 slices of thick-cut and caramelized bacon.<br><br>Overall, the meal was good, but the ambiance was what made it worth going to.

It was not the usual thick hoagie style bread but a slice of bread buttered and toasted. It helped make it easier to eat and was less filling. The prime rib sandwich was also very good. The prime rib was thinly sliced and well cooked. When I first looked at the menu, I thought it was limited however all their food was awesome.

Food was excellent but what pushes this place over the top is the atmosphere. Sunlight penetrates the glass ceiling to fill the room.

Large trees add a splash of natural green to the surrounding brick walls. Crystal chandeliers adorned with hundreds of lights make you wonder whether this is all a dream... That's certainly what I thought when I first saw photos on Yelp, but I can tell you that it's all very real.<br><br>We ordered the Artisanal Prosciutto to start, complete with parmesan cheese, grapes, and a small, warm baguette - a perfect combination.

It's a restaurant that also serves as an urban oasis; blending nature with modern elegance. Make sure to bring a camera because the interior is gorgeous. 3 Arts club is nestled within Restoration Hardware (RH). Enter from the RH entrance then make a left to the hostess table for seating. Â <br><br>I was accompanied by a friend for a weekend lunch around 3pm and we placed ourselves in queue for a table. Our hostess then gave us a buzzer and told us our wait time would be approximately 50 minutes. It would've been convenient to make a reservation prior to our visit but I was told they only accept walk-ins. <br><br>Despite the lengthy wait, we decided to stay. We had traveled a ways to get here and canceling plans would be a fruitless disappointment. Plus, I had my heart set on visiting this place, so we were going to wait. During our wait, we wandered around the cavernous 4 story confines of Restoration Hardware. Â I will post a separate review for the store at a later date as this review solely focuses on the 3 Arts Club experience.<br><br>Once our table opened up, the hostess led us into the restaurant. As I stepped foot into the restaurant, two words came to mind, exquisite and stunning.<br><br>The first thing you'll notice from above is the chandelier. The brilliant crystal tiers hung from the glass ceiling supported by steel beams. The natural light shining through the ceiling illuminated the space; contrasting the dark and dreary afternoon we experienced outdoors. Massive planters with live trees towering upwards toward the ceiling lined all 4 corners of the space giving it an earthy feel. Plush contemporary dining furniture complemented the look giving it a cozy vibe. Top it all with a patina fountain in the center and you've got the components for a beautiful event space.<br><br>This restaurant makes for a great meet-up spot and the ambiance is amazing; however the food leaves much to be desired. A burger and fries cost nearly $20 (which doesn't include your drink and tip.) Reflecting back on my meal, I wasn't over the moon with it. My burger patty was thick, bland, and dry. It was a far cry from burgers I've had elsewhere and I'll never order this again. In fact, I've had better hot dogs (and didn't have to wait an hour) coming out of a Home Depot compared to the standard casual fare offered here. <br><br>In addition to my subpar lunch, I can't say much for our server either. I could see she was obviously overwhelmed by the tables she had. At the end of our meal, when I wanted to split our check, she didn't like the idea and her displeasure showed in her body language. The minute I requested a split check, I was met with an eye roll and a no. That didn't sit right with me at all. A split check is a common ask and at a place where a subpar burger and fries cost over $20, such a simple thing should be automatic. It's bad enough the burger was a disappointment but I didn't need it served with a side of attitude. <br><br>It's pretty obvious by the clientele that the dress code commands a step above casual. It isn't necessary to be dressed in cocktail attire but I did see a couple or two dressed like that here. I had to chuckle a bit for their pretentiousness but when in Rome... <br><br>Overall, I thought it was a beautiful space but it was nothing more than that. Unless you live near the area or are staying in a nearby hotel, expect your commute to be terrible. Â It will cost an extra $15ish for valet if you drive in. The Gold Coast area is prime real estate and because of it, parking is a nightmare. For the budget conscious, your best bet is to take public transport.

They don't get a full 5 stars because the food was very expensive for things I can get elsewhere, i.e. salad, burger, grilled cheese (which doesn't come with tomato soup, nor do they make tomato soup...how do you eat there grilled cheese then??

There was much less of a wait and the atmosphere seemed very relaxed, rather than frantic. Our server, Anthony, was incredible! He was perfect- funny, attentive, and just overall wonderful. The food for dinner was better than brunch. I got the French dip and my friend got the garlic roasted chicken. While both were very tasty, I still think it was a bit overpriced. However, when you factor in the atmosphere, the price makes sense. <br><br>Overall, this is a fantastic place for a special occasion. Take my word for it and go for lunch/dinner instead of weekend brunch. You'll get a much better experience!<br><br>No thanks. This is clearly a gimmick restaurant that relies on the fact that people wait in line so long to get in to continue to get people in. <br><br>This is a GORGEOUS restaurant. Absolutely beautiful atmosphere, both in the atrium and adjoining \"wine bar\". I can see why this was on my friend's list of \"must go\" atmosphere restaurants in Chicago. However, this is a rip-off tourist/gimmick trap that is a nightmare on all counts that don't involve the beautiful atrium. <br><br>They do not take reservations. So my friend and I got in line at 10:45 in the massive line for opening at 11. We got to the host stand at 11:15 and we're sat at 11:45. The seating is comfy. The service is sub-standard for the prices they are charging. Everyone who came to our table was CLEARLY inexperienced in the service industry and I am shocked that a high end restaurant had service like this. We barely saw our server and she was awkward at best. <br><br>Now let's talk about how these people want to charge completely ridiculous prices for mediocre at best food. My friend ordered a side of fruit- which had halved grapes, bananas, and a couple pieces of cantaloupe for $6. I ordered a \"ham and cheese\" croissant which had about one ounce of ham and if it had cheese I couldn't taste it for another $6. I did not like it. We split a side of bacon- $10, and this one was good. 4 thick slices of well seasoned bacon. <br><br>The people around us ordered more robust meals, and it was clear that their French fries ($8 for a side) are nothing special. <br><br>So maybe come and visit the pretty interior and then walk out. The service was mediocre at best, the food was not at all worth the price.

We got there really early to get a spot in line and I'm so glad we did! By the time it opened, the line was so long that they had to cut it off- forcing those at the end of the line to wait an extra hour or two. <br><br>The menu pretty simple and everything (food and drink) we tried was delicious! My favorites were the truffles grilled cheese and the smoked salmon board. Our server was great- he provided some recommendations, was attentive and very patient as well. <br><br>After brunch, we spent a good amount of time just wandering around restoration hardware, admiring the beautiful furniture and room designs on each floor. <br><br>5 stars, easily!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jHcboPqR2wOGZIy99YKMPQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "Burrata"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uGztqobgr9BmBFPvT3oAqw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Truffled grilled cheese- amazing!"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tkHqReeLM7h4EZHuIOmHTQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "lobster roll"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "We stumbled upon this place while exploring the Gold Coast.

There was already a huge line wrapping inside and outside the building, and we still ended up having to wait 15 minutes before being seated. Perhaps the weekdays aren't as busy.<br><br>Service was decent. Prices aren't super expensive either, for the bougieness level. I ordered the RH Scramble which comes with scrambled eggs (perfectly cooked), half an avocado (which you can use to make your own avo toast), and Texas toast (delicious but quite buttery and heavy after a while).<br><br>I would definitely come back if I'm in the area!

I'll be honest and tell you that I came for the sole purpose of pictures. I did not have high expectations in regards to the food because pretty places tend not to have amazing food. <br><br>I ordered the RH Scramble with a side of bacon for a grand total of $22 pretax. I was pleasantly surprised to have nothing bad to say about the food itself! The flavors were all very good. The avocado was fresh, bread was good, eggs were cooked to my liking. The bacon was also the boujeeist bacon I have ever had! A very thick cut with amazing maple flavor. Was it worth $25+? Probably not but I felt like I was paying for the entire experience as a whole as opposed to just the food. <br><br>Things to note: this place does not take reservations so if you come on a busier day (i.e. the weekends), be prepared to wait at least an hour before being seated. This is normally not a problem because it gives you ample time to explore the rest of the building (which is a must!). So many great Insta opportunities!

Don't know what we did to deserve that but I don't even like fries and I ate more than my fair share! I was fighting a cold so I loved that I could get a fresh juice while the husband opted for wine. <br><br>We then moved on to the Burrata which was one of the most amazing treats we had in Chicago. Fresh tomatoes, delicious olive oil. So amazing. We then split the lobster roll which was killer. I normally find those super mayo-heavy and blah but this was by far the best I've had. Thick and juicy chunks of lobster, light on the mayo, and with perfectly buttered and crisped bread.

This is a historic building that is exquisitely decorated through and through --and no surprises since this restaurant sits inside Restoration Hardware's flagship store in Chicago.<br><br>There are 4 floors here, and this Cafe sits on the first floor in a gorgeous domed patio with a fountain in the middle. Look at the pictures, but they do no justice until you're there. Amazing natural light everywhere.<br><br>There are sitting areas that are meticulously decorated, like living rooms, with couches and chairs, center tables. There are bistro-like tables and chairs which are quite comfy. Nice ambient music as well.<br><br>We ordered the RH Scramble + Bacon. I asked for my eggs a little firmer since we were told the way they prepare them are a little runny --related note: the other day I saw Chef Ramsey saying that runny was the way scrambled eggs should be... No thanks, Chef.<br><br>Eggs were really good! Very savory and with half an avocado sitting on the side, salt and cracked pepper on top. Their toast with strawberry marmalade was absolutely fantastic. Bread was super fluffy and the homemade marmalade amazing. The bacon was this thick-cut side order of amazing bacon cooked to perfection --about 5 slices. Coffee was good, too.<br><br>Service was very attentive and prompt, from the hostess to the server (shout out to Erin!).
