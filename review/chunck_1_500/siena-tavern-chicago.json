The grilled octopus is some of the best in the city. All of it was tender, not just the smaller pieces. The flavor was great and I wish we had some bread for the spicy juice. <br>The farro risotto with rock shrimp was a killer. A must order. <br><br>Finally had dinner and it was a winner. Of course we had to start with the octopus. We need to get bread for the juice!<br>For entrees we had the pappardelle with a meat sauce and the tortellini with butternut squash. <br>The peanut butter gelato was a hit with me and my wife liked the strawberry sorbet. <br>In the evening the room is loud and we had to lean in to talk. <br>Our server, Andrew, was very attentive.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The food was amazing as well as the service.

He was awesome. We sat back at the bar the second time just so we could order from him again. Great service and really nice guy.

Okay no problem.<br><br>We ordered the burrata and another app they're known for. I thought the burrata was delicious.

We had the waitress tell us about her suggestions and the most popular items, but that just made it even harder to decide!! I ordered the scallops and my friends got the squid ink linguine, spaghetti, and brick chicken diavolo. We also got the cocoli as an appetizer. <br><br>I got a taste of all three my friends got. I'd say my favorite out the three was the chicken. It seems basic, but the chicken was just perfect - so juicy, moist, tender, and flavorful. The linguine came with lobster and the spaghetti with crab - both absolutely delicious. With all that being said, the scallops were perfection. The bottom of the plate was smothered in what I believe to be squash puree, topped with the scallops and cauliflower. The scallops were large and seared just right. To be the cauliflower were a tad bland and could have used a touch more of flavor. <br><br>Service 5/5<br>Our waitress was beyond patient - she checked in on us three times before we were ready to order, she went through the entire menu giving us one or two favorites from each section, and answered our many questions. Our waters were never empty and she was quick without making us feel rushed. <br><br>Ambiance 4.5/5<br>The lights are dim here giving it a romantic vibe, but it's also casual.

Just typing this makes me want it all over again!

Plus the wine list is not your average - they seem to carefully select reasonably priced Italian Coastal wines that pair well with their main meals. <br><br>I will say when it comes to Italian food, I am extra fussy because I grew up on the real deal homemade from scratch Italian but Sienna Tavern has this Savory Holy Heaven 12oz (no, that's not a typo) Wagu Meatball ($19) that's worth all the indulgence! It's considered an appetizer but if not shared, it can easily become your only dish! Go ahead, you deserve it!! <br><br>Also while it's not a \"Chicago style pizza\" contender, it's a lovely light doughy crust with pretty much any topping you could desire and not too cheesy. Pretty much can't go wrong and the kitchen serves pizza til midnight y'all! <br><br>The bartenders and waitstaff are the epitome of Midwestern Hospitality and have clearly consumed if not all, definitely most of the menu so you can count on their recommendations if you are unsure.<br><br>Know that no matter when you go, it's likely to be buzzing with River North's young professionals and a smattering of tourists sent over by wise hotel concierges. Good chance you will have to wait a bit to be seated. Having said that, on a nice sunny day, brunch on the patio is super chill vibe but feels disconnected from the energy inside... however a seat at the bar near the pizza oven is actually my preference because it puts you in a great spot for watching all the scrumptious dishes being prepped to tease your tastebuds! <br><br>My reviews are all about the ENTIRE experience. Only downside is sitting at either bar (they have two) equates to thirsty patrons hovering over your food like vultures (I like my personal space bubble when I'm eating lol) and possibly stealing your bread baskets or taking an elbow as they attempt to hail down bar service! No joke! Scram kids. This is the 3rd time this has happened to me here. At least the bread is free right?<br><br>Kinda not what you want when you are spending $50+ to treat yourself and you gotta put up with that ish!

I don't often travel with my dog but when I do I like to take him out and about with me. I called a head to make sure that their patio was open and informed them that I had my pooch with me. When I arrived there was some miscommunication between the hostess and the person who spoke on the phone with me but after waiting a few minutes they were able to set a table for me and asked if I was interested in their doggie menu for my pooch. We opted for the skirt steak for the little one. It was simply grilled with olive oil.<br><br>I opted for their Margherita Pizza which had a great sauce, which had the right balance of sweetness. The crust was flavourful, chewy but crispy on the outside just the way I like it. The cheese wasn't too over powering. It was a great pizza but nothing mind blowing. <br>My husband opted for their lobster roll. This was the cold roll variation with citrus poached lobster lightly tossed with an herb mayo. This was a light dish perfect for a light lunch. The citrus poached lobster gives it a light vibrant feel to its traditional heavily drenched mayo cold lobster roll. The plus was the accompaniment of Parmesan fries, they were delicious. I also had their beet juice to quench my thirst, nothing really special to this just a simple ordinary glass of beer juice. <br><br>I will definitely have to give this restaurant another visit without the pooch and try out everything else on their lunch, dinner and BRUNCH menu! I would love to enjoy the dining experience in their dining room as it had an amazing decor especially when lit up in the evening. <br><br>I would like to thank the servers and staff who made my trip with my pooch so memorable.

And lastly, anything with a \"puppy patio\" serving \"woof-cream\" (dairy-free) has my vote!

The freshness of the cherry tomatoes and artichokes in the omelet blew us away, and the potatoes it came with were to die for. The potatoes were garnished with lots of fresh Parmesan.

It was divine, but only when shmeared with a ton of the cream that came on the side with it. The French toast itself didn't taste like it had been soaked in espresso, as they claimed.

I liked their caramel cookie jar was tasty but i'm not a huge caramel fan so it is just based on preference.<br><br>Drinks: I have loved every single drink I have ever ordered here but my absolute favorite is their No. 29 Â (belvedere, prosecco, grapefruit, lemon, mint, strawberry). They have a cool selection of craft beers as well.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Thanks to Yelp, another solid pick for great Italian food in a modern groovy setting! Â The space is half bar to the left, half restaurant to the right. Â The bar area has a dance floor so it is not a place for a quiet cocktail.....it's a place to elbow your way to the bar, get your drink on, and people watch.<br><br>The restaurant is an upscale dining experience, the food is solid (I had the brick chicken). Â The meatball appetizer was great - the sauce delicious. Â There is a solid wine list. Â The tables are cozy...the noise level is a bit high but it will keep your energy up as you head out to your post dinner partying!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Amazing meal - fun atmosphere - great service!

Came here on a Saturday night for some drinks with a friend. The whole place was super crowded but we luckily grabbed two bar stools at the mini bar by the pizza oven. Â Our bartender was amazing! Very attentive and nice even though he was swamped. We each got three drinks. Two from the menu of cocktails and then our bartender was kind enough to make us custom pomegranate martinis for our last round! We weren't very hungry but we kept seeing the amazing pizzas being made right in front of us so we had to try one. We ordered the margarita pizza which was amazing! <br><br>Overall it's a great environment with great gooand yummy drinks! I will definitely come back!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I can't begin to say enough good things about this place. Â This place is great for date nights, girls nights or after work happy hour. Â I have been here multiple times and am never disappointed with the service or the meals. <br><br>Starting with the appetizers, the meat and cheese platters are a bit pricey for my liking. Â The bruschetta is my favorite. Light and easy. <br><br>Pizzas: The cinque formaggi pizza and the margarita are great. Â Can be enough for one person, or split. <br><br>Pastas: Hands down the pappardelle pasta is the best. The gnocchi with added pancetta, so great. I would choose one of these two over the orecchiette pasta. <br><br>Dessert: The MONKEY BREAD!<br><br>Drinks: I have loved every single drink I have ever ordered here but my absolute favorite is their No. 29 Â (belvedere, prosecco, grapefruit, lemon, mint, strawberry). They have a very unique selection of drinks and craft beers!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Visited last night with a girlfriend and scored a pair of bar seats around 7:30 which I must applaud myself for as the place was packed on a Friday night. My friend and I had a great time and split the meatball, which was huge, a side of brussel sprouts, and a kale salad. They split the salad for us in the back, which was nice. This was the perfect amount of food for us. Â The meatball was seriously amazing and comes with a side of toasted bread for dipping in the marinara sauce which was tart and sweet at the same time. I had the No. 2 cocktail which was good and my friend had the No. 12 which she loved. The service was fast and attentive and they have TVs. Only downside is it is a bit loud.", "pics": null}}]}
