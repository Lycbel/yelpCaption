However, Wildberry deserves the praise in my opinion. I used the waitlist feature on Yelp on a Saturday morning. About 38 parties were ahead of me, and it would take about 45 minutes. I found that to be quite accurate. I also checked the other (original) Wildberry location out of curiosity, and it notified me that over 100 parties were ahead of me. Yikes, no thanks, I'll stick to this newer location!<br><br>When I arrived, they were still setting up the table and I waited only about 7 minutes. The restaurant was packed but kudos to them because the service was still somehow attentive and sufficient.<br><br>I tried the following: <br>1. Garden Skillet - Bland and needed more salt, but decent otherwise.<br>2. Banana Coconut Cream pancake - Recommended by the server. They were fluffy and delicious, having just enough cream to balance the flavor.<br>3. Fresca Omelet - Nice golden color and very tasty. All of the items mixed into the omelet complimented it. I especially enjoyed the bites of avocado in the omelet.<br>4. Blueberry Danish Crepe - My favorite sweet breakfast item! Nice presentation, not too sweet, good texture from the crumbly bits, and surrounded with fresh blueberries.<br>5. Vegan Breakfast Hash (with corned beef instead of vegan patty): Possibly my favorite savory breakfast item. Loved the crispy bits of hash browns, good vegetable assortment, and this was seasoned well.<br>6.

The place is super big and was packed to the brim when we arrived, but we put our names in online about 30 min before and had no problem getting checked in and seated.<br><br>Between the three of us, we got the butchers block skillet (shredded hash browns, sausage, ham, bacon, eggs, topped with melted cheese), a burger, and the BLT. The butchers block was my favorite- the hash browns had a nice texture and weren't too soft or chewy, and the ratio of meats to cheese to potato was spot and every bite was just delicious. It came with a side of pancakes which were also spot on, fluffy and warm. Although I didn't try it, the burger looked good, really big but still juicy. The blt was also pretty tasty, my one complaint was the bacon could've been cooked a little less because the strips were a bit on the tougher side.<br><br>Overall, Wildberry does a great job with all sorts of classic breakfast/brunch stuff. The menu is pretty wide and covers omelette, hash brown skillets, Benedict's, French toast/pancakes/crepes/waffles, as well as lunch options like sandwiches and wraps.

Brought us the hot sauce before we asked (I'm wondering whether all Asians ask for hot sauce... LOL... I noticed there were other tables without hot sauce on their tables.

I saw people coming in to just get the coffee to go. I asked if I could get their coffee while waiting for our table and have it put in our tab, and they said no. I don't think their coffee is any different from what we got at the table though. The price is the same.

If you aren't doing either of those things, you are waiting too long, my friend.<br><br>Another pro tip: Order a skillet/the chilaquiles/an omelette and pay the extra $2 for the specialty pancakes on the side. You'll get the best of both worlds. Sure, you could do the plain pancakes (they are just okay) or their fruit or toast.... but believe me, people line up for an hour for the pancakes. The food will last you two meals for a good price - heat up the leftover skillet in the oven and enjoy! Or show up extra hungry.

Today Daisy took care of our table and was absolutely super to us.<br><br>I've had a number of things on their menu, as I've been here a handful or two times. The BEST savory dish IMO are the chilaquiles. I don't know what they marinate the meat in, but it blows all their other skillets and omelettes out of the water. Not that the other things aren't delicious (they are pretty good), but the CHILAQUILES. The only iffy things I've had are the butcher block skillet and the breakfast burrito, which are better elsewhere. Also, you can't go wrong with any of their sweet options. Berry bliss is always a good flavor choice, but I am also partial to the lemon blackberry and cinnamon roll. Today I got the french toast lemon blackberry and it was a delicious cakey delicacy. Not french toast per se, it was literally a spiral cake sliced into pieces and covered in sweet cream sauce.

So simple, but not many places can make it right. I tried the pancakes, skillets and omelets here and nothing got stuck in my memory. All were just very big portions and more like sustenance. Pancakes can be fluffier and more golden brown vibrant. Skillets arrived late so they were coldish and lacking the kicky perkiness. The staff are very nice in both locations.
