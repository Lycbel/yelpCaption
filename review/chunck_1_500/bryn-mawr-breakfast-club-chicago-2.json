The waiting area was small and tight, but the line moved pretty quickly. I could see the cafe counter where espresso drinks were prepared, which added a nice vibe. After about 15-20 minutes of waiting for a three person table, we were called. <br>I ordered the Pajun pancake. I had no idea what Pajun meant (maybe a mix of Cajun and some other culture that begins with P?), but the description sounded good. Scallion pancake with pork belly, brussel sprouts, potatoes, eggs, and toast. When it was served and I tasted it: HOLY COW I was not expecting such deliciousness!! Fwhat? After eating it I realized the pancake was very similar to a Korean pancake, and there was a little kimchi on it so I guess Pajun is a Korean word I'd never heard of. <br>The others at my table ordered the Mayan Benedict which I was told was EXCELLLENT (really cool thing is that it's served on a bean cake and it had a Mayan salsa on top instead of hollandaise) and I think the other dish was a carnitas skillet which was also good. <br>The service was kind, quick, and constant. They made sure our water was full, we had all the condiments we needed, and that everything was going well. <br>Despite the tight space, this restaurant was a pleasant surprise with wonderful food and a comfy, cozy atmosphere. Next time I visit Chicago, I want to come back and eat here again!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/R3JZ32PUyq9qeVwu5i51pQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Pajun pancake"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oRAWOOFm72LQB4PN5VLNsQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Mayan Benedict"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "UPDATE: <br><br>Revisited and had the smoked salmon omelette and it was pretty tasty! Salmon was a bit more done than I would have liked but that's only because the eggs were well done and steaming hot!

It wasn't my favorite, but it was still delightful. <br><br>Ordered a stuffed guava French toast. Amazing, so good, not overly sweet and there were cute of peach and guava fruit leather! This was astounding. <br><br>Preciously... <br>They moved a few stores away! I didn't know until I arrived and thought perhaps the business closed. <br><br>Anyways, their new space is larger and decorated with the same rustic feel. Love that they put out fresh flowers at every table. Staff is always friendly and attentive. <br><br>Onto the food. <br>Key lime cheesecake stuffed French toast: It was pretty amazing. Quite a large portion so I shared with a friend. It had the right acidity to cream ratio, wasn't overly sweet compared to one of their stuffed french toasts I had a couple years back. <br><br>Skirt steak skillet: was good! Full of steak, cheese, and topped with yolky eggs. <br><br>2 eggs with chicken sausage: my go-to here.

That's right, I paid $80 because while I was dining, I got a $60 ticket for street cleaning. I had no idea there was street cleaning as the signs were not posted where I could see them. I use the city parking app and it gave me no indication that I wasn't supposed to park where I did, only that there was no payment at the time I was there. <br><br>I was going to try to write a nice review of this place because the interior design is so quaint, dating the time when the restaurant probably opened. No one decorates that way anymore. Unfortunately, the food was just okay, and the coffee was the only food that stayed warm. I ate quickly so that I wasn't eating a cold breakfast, but my rye toast was too cold to melt the butter by the time I got to it. While I dined, the restaurant was freezing! They had just opened so they probably turn the heat off at night to save money.

The second reason was my order of the lox asparagus benedict and the breakfast potatoes that came with it. The potatoes were a bit hard and burnt and seemed like it wasn't freshly cooked.

The beautiful modern take on diner decor was so inviting and clean. You can tell the owners really love and cherish their business. The whole staff is working hard to provide fast, efficient and friendly service - literally every person was busting their tails and doing it with a smile!! i always believe that happy employees make yummier food!!<br><br>I tried the steak skillet, but swapped the steak for grilled chicken. Our server had no quarrels with the protein swap and was glad to accommodate. My wife had the chorizo skillet - both we're phenomenal. The perfect diner grub. My only critique was the Gorgonzola cheese in my skillet. I had never heard of it and I probably should have inquired about it. It was very pungent and perhaps too intense for my first meal of the day, but it didn't bother me much at all. Next time I'll probably just ask for cotija cheese or something more mellow not as overpowering maybe something just more complimentary to the rest of the dish. <br><br>I did also notice that they take their coffee program very serious. Aside from the barista doing a full line or espresso-based drinks they also have two different cold brews on tap.

It now has more seats, but there still can be a line for breakfast and brunch on the weekends. So DO NOT SLEEP IN for this one! The place still features a creative barn and farm theme with the rooster being its staple landmark. The breakfast club menu was also extended to offer more. I noticed there is a larger variety of dough-based breakfast items to choose from. However, the breakfast skillets are the specialities (personal opinion). If you are simple breakfast person and critique how you are eggs should be cooked, the Breakfast Club can serve up a mean and delicious classic gravy and biscuit, sausage, and egg combo.

Â I mean, who carries cash these days? <br> <br>I ordered the Sourdough French toast, which satisfied my sweet and savory cravings at the same time. Â I would order it again. Â Coffee was refilled regularly. Â One person's order was supposed to include scrambled eggs and came over-easy. Â She didn't make a fuss about it, but it would have been nice for her to get what she ordered. <br><br>Once we were finished eating, they really wanted to turn the table. Â  Sure, there were a lot of people waiting outside, but it's nice not to be rushed. Â We left almost immediately after having paid the bill. Â I think if circumstances were different, we may have hung back for another 10-15 minutes and finished off our coffee. I love great food, but enjoying the atmosphere and the company are just as important. Â  I'm not docking them for this, as I understand the need to turn the tables, but if you're looking for a place that will let you hang out for a bit drinking your coffee after the meal, this isn't it. <br><br>I would go back, but with 2 caveats: 1) Bring cash 2) perhaps with less people so sorting out the check is less of a hassle.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Cute Farmhouse themed restaurant!

The server was very pleasant and kind , he came right away with a water and the delicious house coffee followed next as I sat there going Uber the menu. They have a regular menu and a special menu. He walked me through both menus and told me his favourites ( Love it every single time when people from the business tell me their favourites ). <br><br>After some discussion I decided to order the spicy Jamaican omelette which has shrimp , cilantro , mango chutney and avocado as main ingredients and half an order of the their french toast with sour cherry and cream ( yes they do half order of the hot cakes and french toast - perfect dessert for breakfast / brunch ). <br><br>As I waited for the food to arrive the coffee cup was never half empty , the servers are great in making sure you've got coffee in your cup all the time. <br><br>The food arrived within 10 minutes and the rest is something that my taste buds will savour for sometime to come. The Jamaican omelette was just , to put it simple and Â make a statement - DELICIOUS. The mango chutney added the perfect flavour to the omelette , every bite was Â a mix of freshness with avocado and savoury with the spices. The potatoes on the side were crisp and fresh which adds to the flavour. <br><br>Dessert time started with the french toast. I'm a big french toast fan and I set very high standards ( bongo room weekend french toast is where I set the bar ) and this place definitely met those standards and surpassed it then. The toast was soft and fluffy and the fruit addition with sour cherry was the perfect combination of zesty and sweet. Half an order was all I needed and it was just perfect amount of satisfied and still wanting more with not stuffing myself. <br><br>I was a happy man by this time. As I paid my bill I stopped by the kitchen to thank all the people making this meal so delicious every single day for every single person. <br><br>This place is definitely worth the drive no matter what part of Chicago you are from.
