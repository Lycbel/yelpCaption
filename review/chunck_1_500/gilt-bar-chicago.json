Out of all the places I've dined at, Gilt Bar is the home of my favorite pasta in Chicago. It's just perfect. The atmosphere is what caught my attention before coming here for the first time. It's so dimly lit and romantic but still lively and inviting for larger groups. They even have a section in the middle with couches and low tables for groups. But I've only ever come here with my fianc√© and we can't get enough of this place. <br><br>I always, always, always order the truffle pasta, it's a no brainer. The homemade pasta is so delicate and tender covered in savory truffle sauce. It's truly orgasmic. This time we started out with the delice de bourgogne, which is a creamy spreadable cheese. Again, just out of this world. I've tried to find a cheese similar to this basically everywhere... And I can't. It's a creamy cheese lover's dream. <br><br>You definitely want to make a reservation especially on a weekend. And I would recommend making it a couple weeks in advance as well. I've been here 4 times and have had exceptional service each and every time, never any issues or complaints about that.<br><br>Also, be sure to take a trip downstairs!

I ordered the arugula salad, which I surprisingly loved despite typically not being a fan of sweet dressings. I also ordered the truffle pasta because I had heard good things, and it lived up to expectations. My only qualm about dinner was that the portion sizes were quite small.

A friend of mine decided to go out and celebrate my engagement. I absolutely fell in love with the portion of the restaurant called the library. I told my fianc√© I was going to dinner with a friend but he didn't ask me what restaurant I was going to until I was parking my car to walk into Gilt. He tells me that his uncle, Charlie, was responsible for the remodeling and part construction of Gilt and to say hello to the owner (R) on his behalf and since I loved the design of Gilt to inquire about the other restaurants owned by this family. Isn't it crazy how small the world is? I had no idea. Anyways, my friend had gotten to Gilt before me and she had put our names down on the wait list and one of the hostesses told her that it would be anywhere from a half an hot wait to an hour and fifteen but just to keep an eye out on her phone when she gets the text confirmation that her table is ready. Anyways, when I walked in, I guess the hostess didn't realize that I was with my friend Alex and so I said to her is the owner here and she said no unfortunately R isn't here tonight and then she said I'll see if I can get a table for you earlier and again took our names down. We decided to get a drink (me Non-alcoholic and my friend a gin and honey) while we waited for our glorious text. Once we figured out the library was downstairs, we asked the hostess, Keira, if we could be seated in the library and she said, \"oh it's a four hour wait for the library, not tonight ladies\".... not gonna lie, I was sad to hear it. <br><br>We finally got our text and approached Keira and even before we told her we got a text, she says, \"oh I'm not ready for you\" and my friend pulled out her phone and said, \"that's okay, someone else is because we got a text\" - Keira or Kyra with the headband looked dumbfounded how we got seated so quickly after being on the wait list for about 25 minutes. To make matters worse for Keira, IMAGINE OUR SHOCK when a super nice hostess says to my friend and me, \"follow me downstairs ladies\" and my friend and I look at each other and were like wait, \"downstairs?\" And she says, \"the library\". I wanted to bust out my happy dance. This super nice server had no idea that we had inquired about seating in the library!! <br><br>What a fiasco with the hostesses. The usually tell you a much longer wait time than how long you'll actually wait. So don't be scared away by the wait. Despite all the issues with getting a seat, my friend and I were besides ourselves from joy. After we were seated, we ordered the Burrata. It was my first time having Burrata so I didn't know what to expect. The waiter told us its a combo mozzarella and cream cheese. If you ask me, it could have used some salt because it tasted a bit bland. However, paired with the fire roasted tomatoes- Lord have MERCY!! It was absolutely incredible! I could have eaten the tomatoes all night long. First of all, they had that freshly picked tomato smell that I rarely come across in the US. Secondly, they were sweet and marinated so they really complimented the Burrata along with the bread so well. Gilt won me over the moment I saw the very well toasted bread- thank you Gilt!! <br><br>As for our main dish, I ordered the roasted salmon and my friend had the ricotta gnocchi and we had a side of the mashed potatoes. The salmon itself was melt in your mouth goodness, it was juicy yet really well cooked. It was slightly crispy on the outside which I didn't complain about because I love that. I really didn't like the capers served with the fish because it was too sour and salty for my liking!! Thank goodness for the mashed potatoes because they really complimented the fish. The mashed potatoes had chicken jus, roasted garlic and chives. The chicken jus was usual to see but really tasty. I'm not a mashed potato type of girl but these mashed potatoes were divine. Let's talk about the gnocchi. Wow. The waiter told us it was house made and let me just tell you, homie was not lying!! If you've ever made any type of bread or pasta at home, then you know how the dough of that feels on your hand... soft on texture, light on your skin and plump in size. Well, the gnocchi tasted like that and some. The ricotta cheese inside was sort of fluffy but not really but smooth. Paired with the butternut squash, this was fine dining at its best! It was soooo smooth to eat- I've never tasted anything like it! I highly recommend it!<br><br>Overall, service was okay. The food took a while to come out and the waiter wasn't as attentive as I would have liked him to be but I understand, happens on Friday's! The place is super clean but also really dimly lit so that you could barely read the menu without turning on your iPhone flash. ¬†This place has a certain ambiance that makes you feel like you stepped into the mobster scene back in the 1920's.

An incredible night celebrating our anniversary, such incredible service from the hostess to the manager. We were seated in the speakeasy downstairs, a true gem, and the music, cocktails and delicious food made the night complete. We'd recommend the gem salad, bone marrow and truffle pasta. We'll come back in a heartbeat!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago! I always make a point to come here when visiting Chicago. ¬†Incredible food,decor and ambiance. ¬†The downstairs library/ lounge is so cozy and beautiful.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I would have to agree with the previous reviews. This place is pretty epic. Definitely has the chill out type vibe. The decor inside is pretty cool. Solid spot for a romantic date night. They also have that photo booth in the basement which is just a nice touch to the overall theme. <br><br>We had reservations through open table for Friday night. Naturally, Chicago traffic was terrible so we were running late. We were able to adjust our reservation time and gilt was very accommodating to making sure we still had a table. So the customer service aspect was wonderful. <br><br>After we were seated, we were handed the menus and greeted by our waitress. It was my first time here and I was unsure of what to get, what was good. Her inability to really recommend anything or suggest something to try was disappointing. But she was friendly and polite. And we were able to figure it out. <br><br>We ordered the garlic bread which was delicious. The short rib pot roast which was by far the best thing we ordered. The flavors were just incredible! The pasta dish was pretty good. But that short rib stole the show. <br><br>All in all, I would definitely go back if I'm in the area. We had a great time there. I would just like better drink pairing recommendations.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/h_Y54RP3XphU7zTKJ6sRiA/348s.jpg", "caption": "Chopped salad and balsamic garlic bread   Soooo good!"}]}}]}
