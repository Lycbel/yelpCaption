I had tried to get reservations a few times in the past but hadn't been able to. Finally was able to get reservations for two on a Friday night. The ambiance here is nice, which is pretty standard for Italian restaurants. They seated us in this cute alcove like space. The restaurant was packed at this time.<br><br>Although I was excited to try this place I felt pretty let down by their food. Everything was soooo average. We started with mini veal meatballs ($11.95) and heirloom tomato caprese ($12.95) which is burrata cheese with tomatoes. I normally LOVE burrata but this one was disappointing. Usually when you cut burrata there's a delicious creamy interior which is so rich in flavor. This one didn't have that at all. It just didn't seem fresh and if anything it seemed a bit chewy. Â The meatballs was prob the best dish of the night but also kind of average. Portion of meatballs was quite large.<br><br>For drinks I tired the watermelon daiquiri which I didn't like (the taste was quite sour and unpleasant) so our waiter was nice enough to change it out for a white wine sangria which was pretty good.<br><br>For the main course, we ordered the hand rolled gnocchi ($17.95) and the pacheri ($18.95). The gnocchi was in my opinion below average - chewy and the entire dish was not that flavorful. The pacheri was recommended by our waiter. It had large pieces of pasta with pork. This dish was flavorful but really oily and for some reason didn't taste fresh. Both of these dishes were good sized portions. <br><br>We had come for a special occasion so for dessert they gave us a slice of brownie. The texture of this brownie was also chewy and it was a bit cold. We ate 2 bites and left the rest. <br><br>Overall in my opinion I think Osteria Via Stato is overrated. There are other much better Italian restaurants in Chicago. Service is good though and staff is nice. But it's not worth it for the food.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SrPiVSrI-adJg4dmE94q5w/348s.jpg", "caption": "Mini Mini Veal Meatballs"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uYeMVZScZtnV9TtBN9-dSQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Heirloom tomato caprese (burrata)"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FyYlqMimpeUSI0X9P8FuSw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Gnocchi (left) and pacheri (right)"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "I met up with friends for dinner here and it was absolutely fabulous!

We were warmly greeted upon arriving and decided to dine in the pizzeria side. The decor is so warm and inviting, it has an intimate Italian tavern feel to it. It's amazing how the vibe totally tunes out the hustle and bustle of State St. Their wine list is exceptional but I recommend trying their limoncello, which seems to be their specialty. Ask for recommendations from your waiter and you will not go wrong! <br><br>We started off with the antipasti board, prosciutto jam, house marinated olives, and grilled octopus. Everything was great but my favorite had to be the prosciutto jam. It was robust in flavor and complimented the goat cheese excellently. For the main course I went with the chicken Mario and was so pleased I did. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and cooked, with a juice interior, and pan seared in the end to give it a crispy exterior. It was simply delicious and served with greens and a lemon butter sauce. This easily became my favorite dish of the week. It was simple yet so flavorful and light. I definitely recommend it. <br><br>I can't wait to come back to try their specialty pizzas.

Both pizzas were delightfully crunchy, and not too greasy either. The prosciutto americano was the highlight of our meal - I've never had such a unique tasting pizza that's bursting with such contrasting flavors. The sourness of the vinegar, the saltiness of the cheese, the leafiness of the arugula, and the light prosciutto together produces a wonderful sensation in your mouth. The satisfying crunch after each and every bite is the finishing touch of the experience. I highly recommend others getting this dish when they come here. <br><br>The peppered bacon pizza was a nice complement to the prosciutto americano - it was much more different in taste in that it was a bit more greasy and resembled more of a traditional average pizza, but it was still incredibly delicious.

After a bite or two we started fantasizing about the seasoning and dipping sauces the come withe the calamari at cafe baba reeba. Also, this came with a single two inch piece of toasted bread...which was super confusing (I think it might have been accidentally added to the plate because it was so disproportionate to the volume of calamari served).<br><br>Salmon and Shrimp with lobster sauce (special): This dish was PERFECTION. The salmon was cooked perfectly; Â the lobster sauce was creamy and delicious; everything worked well together.<br><br>Scallops over sweet potato mash: The scallops were slightly overcooked (this is a pet peeve of mine). I think the issue was that the brown butter they were booked it was a tad too brown when they were seared. The sweet potato mash was over salted and had a weird combo of overbrowned root veggies and bacon on top...this were overpowering. I would probably rethink this dish entirely. Probably put the scallops over a nice risotto or something more mild that it's easy to taste them.<br><br>Black Old Fashioned: My husband thought this was excellent.<br><br>Ricotta cheese cheesecake: Italian fudge sauce is like an oxymoron. Fudge is not an italian thing (we asked for the fudge sauce on the side). The fudge sauce was good, as was the cheesecake itself, but the kitchen kind of ruined the dish by sprinkling a ton of powdered sugar over the dish/cake. This is a huge no no in my book...kind of like the dreaded mint leaf some places add to a dessert. It was an absolute turn off; not an attractive decoration...just don't do it!<br><br>Service issue: We asked our server for straws on two separate occasions.

They have $5 drink specials from 4-6 and free small plates. We came late so we can't speak to that.<br><br>We ordered three small pizzas to share. These are super thin pizzas and super yummy!

Â It also directly connects to the hotel next door, so good chance for a large group of patrons. Â Service is good (easy to get a server's attention as well).<br><br>The veal meatballs were a delicious appetizer, very savory and the tomato was well seasoned with a hint of smoked or charred tomatoes. Â Any extra sauce goes well with the free bread that they give you (and the sauce is better than just olive oil). Â One of the special pizzas had sausage, broccoli, and carmelized onions as toppings, sounded tasty and healthy. Â The sausage and caramelized onions were quite flavorful, but the broccoli just seemed a bit out of place.

Ended up here from a quick Google search on gluten free options. And it was history from there. No other venue could compare. We chose OVS for our wedding as we wanted great Italian food along with gluten free options. Look no further as Osteria Via Stato went above and beyond our expectations!<br><br>It is no easy task to find a wide variety of gluten free food for the bride and groom. But Osteria checked all the boxes for us down to dessert by making a crust-less cheesecake. And the arugula salad is addicting as well as the Parmesan crusted onions. Please keep in mind all our guests had all the gluten they wanted with the fresh baked bread and other food throughout dinner.<br><br>The staff knows their products and the chef takes great care preparing the food .It was a bonus in earning our Lettuce Entertain You points for our wedding. Allison, Michelle and Abby answered all my questions and accommodated our requests without any issues. It was wonderful to hear from the vendors I was working with that they had a long standing relationship with OVS. Not to worry your guests and vendors will all be fed well. The menu selections are amazing and the tasting was outstanding. The service is top notch as no glass was left empty for long. <br><br>The atmosphere was very inviting and the ceremony was beautiful in the intimate space. The staff set the mood with dozens of candles being lit for the night. Our guests couldn't rave enough about the food and how cozy and welcoming the space felt to them. This coming from Italians was confirmation for me that I selected the right place. It was outside the box and a long way from a traditional hall but it provided a truly unique experience for all. Without hesitation I would book any event at Osteria Via Stato. <br><br>Thank you Osteria Via Stato for making our wedding nothing short of spectacular!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9VwZDk_MBZSvQFbV7GjwVw/348s.jpg", "caption": "Late night snacks of tacos with all the toppings"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_9nL-zIRu5E8tccfbC7T8g/168s.jpg", "caption": "beautiful farmhouse tables"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dl01r134f7MbSsWk97BG_g/168s.jpg", "caption": "Favor boxes included with cookies for your guests"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Great little Italian restaurant.

For appetizers, we did a house salad, bruschetta, their famous onions, and meatballs. We were kind of skeptical about picking meatballs and onions, but both were full of flavor and impressive. For entrees, we had the option of short ribs, white fish, a chicken and a vegetarian pasta... clearly I don't remember the chicken and vegetarian options well because our party is a heavy meat and fish kinda group :) Short rib looked like a normal sized portion but turned out to be huge - very flavorful and moist.
