We had a party of four arrive on a Sunday afternoon with a 30 minute wait. For an asian restaurant, this place is very modern and chic. Even their napkins are made from cloth with the restaurant's name embroidered --very fancy. Despite that, QXY is a hole in a wall spot with yummy dumplings.<br><br>The menu consists of a variety of meat and veggie combinations for the dumpling. To be honest, it was really overwhelming. There must've been well over 50 types of dumplings with your choice between pork, beef, chicken, lamb, shrimp, fish, and veggies paired with an even larger selection of veggies. Thankfully, my local friends did the ordering, but most of the types of fillings tasted similar to me. The one thing that makes a difference is the way the dumplings are being made. You can choose from fried, steamed, and boiled and from an order of 12 or 18 in a range of $9-13 per plate. Even though I'm usually a fan of fried dumplings, the boiled ones were my favorites. All of the dumplings were so juicy, so be very careful when trying to pull them apart. Because of this, the boiled ones were also easier to split than the fried ones.<br><br>We also added the Hot and Spicy Bowl ($11.99) just to try since the skewers didn't seem quite worth it. This dish is essentially a bowl of meats and veggies soaked in mala sauce, which is a popular oily, spicy, and numbing Chinese sauce which consists of Sichuanese peppercorn, chili pepper and various spices simmered with oil. The dish was something interesting to try, but don't think I'd get it again though.<br><br>There's no surprise that the dumplings are amazing here as a restaurant that specializes in one item on the menu.

To add a further twist on things, you can mix and match the types of how the dumplings are made. Fried, boiled, or steamed? All are great in their own way.

I love the variety of stuffing you can get here and the method of cooking. I got the pork and cabbage option, boiled, 12 pieces. The filling was juicy and well seasoned. My friend got the 12 piece tomato and egg, steamed. Both were so delicious! Would definitely recommend both of these options. If you get the steamed option, I would eat them quickly!

This place is poppin, that's zero question. <br><br>We got seated fairly quickly. The chairs were ultra comfortable and the setting of the table was very cute and quaint. Their menu is a fucking IPAD on the table okay. Call me old fashion but I was like okay, this is when you know it's serious. We were seated right in front of the see thru kitchen where I watched in amazement how these ladies went in on hand rolling every roll. I was enchanted and intrigued as if I was watching an art exhibit. It was art. Beautiful, delectable and intricate I couldn't help but gaze how they perfectly folded and pocketed each dumpling. Reality hit and I felt really bad, that's a lot of fucking dumplings to roll every minute of every day and they probably never want to look at another fucking dumpling ever again. Still delightful and magical from a third party perspective ::heart emoji eyes:: <br><br>We couldn't decide how many we wanted because we feared if we got too much it would be well, too much. I was so excited hearing about how cheap the dumplings were for how much you get, that I forgot to even read the prices on the fancy IPAD menu. I was more focused on what type of dumpling we wanted because they have a HUGE wide array of options/selections. Let's face it, it wouldn't have stopped us, but still the bill was surprising.<br><br>So we requested the beef sticks as an appetizer. The bad news was they ran out of beef. The good news? They offered lamb instead. Say no more! The lamb sticks came out and they seemed over seasoned at first and for some, it might be. It tasted like a hint of overkill of Adobo and we all know with seasoning, less is more. Somehow, this worked for me and I thought they were succulent and delicious. Sometimes overkill is needed. <br><br>We decided to start with 2 orders of 12 rolls. We thought, okay, that'll FOR SURE be enough. We had to request the infamous lamb and coriander rolls. We couldn't decide if we wanted steamed or fried. So we also requested to shrimp, cucumber and egg dumplings. We decided for the meat we would request fried and for the veggie, steamed.<br><br>Holy fuck. Not disappointed. Each dumpling was worth the wait. Â Delicious, tender, perfectly chewy, soft, fluffy, perfectly doughy, I couldn't get enough. It was your quintessential dumpling. Simply divine and perfect. <br><br>We decided it wasn't enough and requested one last order of beef and green pepper dumplings fried. They were good but def would stick with your \"non-basic\" dumpling such as anything with coriander. <br><br>Service was good and attentive. Food was excellent. Price? It hurt a little but for what we got and the quality of it, I can't complain. If you're reading reviews that say 6-8 dollars a dumpling, it's no longer the truth. It's no secret this place has caught on to their own hype with their fancy dumpling view television in the waiting area and have more than likely amped their prices to date. <br><br>Can I blame them? <br><br>Nah, because in this case you are getting what you pay for in every perfectly fluffy crevasse of each deliciously rolled dumpling.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/64nMB9ZBEbk-9ynRSpkkPA/348s.jpg", "caption": "Fried lamb and coriander dumplings"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-ZUJ03nVn6n4GR_r9zo78A/168s.jpg", "caption": "Steamed shrimp dumplings"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZSruizng9nIKdQ6NVUKWhw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Steamed shrimp, cucumber and egg dumplings"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "I remember the days of Prosperity Dumpling in NYC's Chinatown with their 5 for $1 delicious handmade dumplings until they unfortunately shut down due to the horrific discovery that their dumpling ladies were making them in the dirty alley outside the building, with the rats...trash...and polluted city air. I'll admit this really wouldn't have deterred me from visiting again for delicious, cheap dumplings. I'm disgusting, I know. It's the same reason I keep going back to Sun Wah despite their many, many shutdowns by the health department. Their Peking duck is just such a good deal.<br><br>QXY offers quality dumplings at a higher price (12 for $9) in a much cleaner, family-friendly environment. The elegant Asian decor (beautiful chairs but clunky), handpainted porcelain tableware, fluorescent lights that reveal any imperfection, the diverse crowd, and the iPad menu (which is nice in theory but you know those aren't wiped down as much as they should be) all contribute to some reassurance that you're eating in an establishment where you can simply enjoy your food. There are so many options for dumpling fillings here, proteins include shrimp, pork, beef, lamb, or chicken. Pair your protein with a vegetable/herb like Napa cabbage, zucchini, mushroom, leek, dill, or coriander, just to name a few. I enjoy the beef and coriander, or classic pork and cabbage, boiled over steamed. It keeps the homemade dumpling skin al dente. The potato salad appetizer is also really tasty, shredded, crunchy, vinegared, and spiced, get it!<br><br>Oh and they offer dumpling making classes! Not sure how much it costs though. But you can register on their website. Dumplings are near and dear to my heart. It reminds me of family gatherings around the dinner table folding hundreds of dumplings together and then boiling and devouring them. I also love that every culture seems to have their own version of a dumpling... samosa, momo, mandoo, empanada, pierogi, ravioli...I love them all!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dTLr9DCE7Kdh2nw4PFzgQw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Fish and peanuts, Potato salad"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nSiN2agItp34o8T20zR3mw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Boiled dumplings"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "We ordered the pig ears, the Hot and Spicy and the 12 boiled Pork and Shrimp dumplings and also the Chrysanthemums tea. <br><br>The pig ears are ok.
