Always a great time!!<br>First time there for brunch, very pleased!<br>Avocado toast was very tasty!<br>And the pumpkin spice hot chocolate was perfect!<br>Wish they used the bigger cups like they use to and looks like they cut back on the marshmallow size too, unfortunately.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I was really looking forward to going to Mindy's. Most of our experience was just fantastic. Our server Brandi was excellent. My date and I were distracted from ordering at each turn and she came by just often enough and was understanding until we figured out what we wanted. I had a lovely glass of red and my date had a cocktail. The octopus with creamy polenta was delicious and even my date who doesn't like octopus all that much enjoyed it. The Mexican hot chocolate was decadent and beautifully spicy although I wish I had had more time to enjoy it. <br><br>Here comes the 4 star part. Let me preface this with: I have been in the service industry for near 17 years in all different kinds a of establishments. Mindy's closes at 10pm the night we were there. At 10pm sharp, with dessert in front of us, one of the staff came around and started clearing tables including our water glasses. By 10 15 he was flipping chairs. Never have I worked someplace where this is appropriate. Now, we were having the nicest time and isn't that what you want in your establishment? I looked around, concerned we were keeping staff from leaving but noticed that neither the front nor back of house looked close to being finished with closing things down so I thought it would be fine if we finished our very heavy hot chocolate (not something you just want to throw back). At 10 20 the aforementioned employee came the table next to us. The girls there each had half a glass of champagne and hot chocolate in front of them. He asked if he could clear anything. They said no and they were still working on things. He then asked if they needed a to go cup. I was shocked. I've never witnessed a more blatant gtfo except at 2am when you legally must leave a bar. <br><br>Like I said, I work in restaurants and this just seemed so incredibly rude. Of course no one wants to work after the sign says you're closed but that's the job. Let people leave high on the service and atmosphere they've enjoyed in your establishment rather than feeling forcibly pushed out and leaving before finishing what they've ordered. It wouldn't have taken much at all to say \"No rush (an acceptable industry lie), but just so you know we close at 10 o'clock.\" Would have given us all the nudge you intended and maybe we needed without being inconsiderate and pushy.

When you go to Mindy's Hot Chocolate and order the hot chocolate, you think, \"oh I like hot chocolate, I'll order that.\" But when you drink it, it becomes the memory of hot chocolate in your mind, forever.<br><br>What a cruel, cruel world this is.<br>At least we have Mindy's Hot Chocolate.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "My husband took me here for my birthday and it was a lovely time.

We went on a Sunday around 11am for brunch without reservations and the wait was 1.5 hours for a table and no wait for the bar. We of course sat at the bar but if you're with a larger party make reservations or try to avoid peak times. We had a simple order, medium hot chocolate and avocado toast. <br><br>The hot chocolate was good but not $8 worth. There as nothing about it that makes me want it again. I can get something similar somewhere else for a lot cheap. The marshmallow was probably the better part of the hot chocolate. It was very light and not overly sweet.<br><br>The avocado toast was also good but could use some adjustments. First of all, you get an entire avocado sliced on top of two very thin pieces of toast. The avocado to toast ratio didn't work. There was so much avocado on the toast that you barely felt like you were eating any toast. I had a really hard time even picking it up and taking a bite out of it. My toast was also slightly burnt so that make it hard to cut and/or bite. The honey ricotta and pistachios were the perfect amount and went so well with the avocado. I did wish I had a little more ricotta. My suggestions would be to have a thicker toast or have less avocado. <br><br>I wouldn't say we didn't' like this place but we also didn't love it. I would maybe try it again if I'm in the area.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ueMKl3S0J-eQ7Xwq5J_-oQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "Avocado Toast"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KeE-ftCkn9sT8dcevsf53A/168s.jpg", "caption": "Side Potatoes"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YfBnn516kkU94O2iWCp6Rg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Medium Hot Chocolate"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "James Beard Foundation Award for \"Outstanding Pastry Chef\" alert.

We ordered the:<br><br>-Old Fashioned Hot Chocolate- Iced! $11(paper straw-- yay, medium hot chocolate, whipped granache, sugary marshmallow) So glad we ordered this. The FANCIEST hot chocolate I have ever had! I don't care for chocolate, and I thought that this was a real treat! Creamy, thick, and a true comfort food (errr- drink).<br>-Ratatouille Hash $16 (Zucchini, Charred onions, cherry tomatoes, eggplant, bell peppers, potatoes, sunny side egg). Underwhelming tomato flavor with a soft, mushy texture. I wish I would have ordered the Southern Benedict or the quiche. <br>-Brioche French Toast $14. You can't really go wrong with french toast at an upscale restaurant. It was very sweet with a creamy texture. Comes with breakfast sausage that had a kick to it.

It took me a minute to get over this, but then there were cheese grits (one of my absolute favorite foods) in the dish and I got over it quickly. The octopus itself has a great flavor, and it's cooked in a way that really just give it the perfect texture. <br><br>Now for the burger. I came in being told that this was supposed to be one of the best burgers in the city, so I went the whole nine yards. Got bacon and egg on top of the cheddar cheese that comes with it, and the sesame seed bun.

A James Beard Awardee for pastries!? Count me in! The desserts changes seasonally, but every time there is always something on the menu that wows me. As of this review, the poached pear dessert I had is sweet but not overly, moist but balanced with crunch and topped with a bold, creamy cheese cake ice cream.

I've never had something so expensive. Personally I feel I would have rather they sold me a mini for $5 as we got the Mac and cheese and the hot cocoa was more money.

I was a little worried because there were so many people clamoring for tables, but when the rest of our party arrived a few minutes later, we were seated almost immediately. We lucked out because there was a wait for tables even when we left over an hour later. If you don't have a reservation for brunch (Good luck getting one, by the way.), you should probably queue up before the restaurant opens.<br><br>The restaurant is lovely, and the service we experienced was quite good. The prices, on the other hand, were elevated. I couldn't help but make references to the $5 milkshake in Pulp Fiction when looking at the $8 hot chocolate prices and the $3 charge for splitting on hot chocolate on the menu. The hot chocolate was exceptional, but wow. And no, there wasn't any bourbon in it. (Pulp Fiction reference, once again.) That's expensive hot chocolate! Also, I had avocado toast as a bit of a joke because it's a trendy item that many people in my 40+ age bracket just don't understand. I think it was $13 or $14, and it was seriously one slice of toast topped with a poached egg, mashed avocado, and some sprouts. There was nothing on the side. No fruit. Nothing.

We were already blown away by the donuts when the hot chocolate came out, piping hot, accompanied by one of their homemade marshmallows. The hot chocolate was so very good, exactly my kind of comfort food; super rich and creamy hot chocolate and the addition of the marshmallow melting in the mug only made it better. Even splitting the one mug of hot chocolate, we struggled to finish it after dinner and dessert because it was so rich and heavy.
