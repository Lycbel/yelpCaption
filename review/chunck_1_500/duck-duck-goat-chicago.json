{"name": "duck-duck-goat-chicago", "reviews": [{"review": {"des": "Duck Duck Goat is one of my favorite meals in Chicago. The food was incredible, the service is excellent, and the atmosphere is really fun. Â I brought my parents here, and despite the fact they are not adventurous eaters, they tried and loved everything we ordered. I have not one single negative thing to say about my experience, and it pains me that there are negative reviews here that focus on how it's hard to get in here. It's busy because it's amazing!! Definitely make reservations well in advance of when you'd like to go. <br>__<br><br>Here's what I ordered: <br><br>1 - The Fox & The Goat Pale Ale <br>I do not normally make comments about drinks, but this beer is seriously great. It's their house beer, and it's a very flavorful pale ale... not one of those that has a generic hop zing and nothing else. I really wish I could pick this up at the liquor store. <br><br>2 - CHAR SIU BAO (Steamed barbecue pork buns)<br>These buns were perfect. Pillowy outside, super tender and flavorful pork inside. The meat to bun ratio was good, the bun was not too thick. We had a party of 4, and got one order of these which comes with 2. They were big enough that even half of one is 3 or 4 bites.<br><br>3 - JIAOZI (Beef short rib and bone marrow potstickers)<br>Again, perfect. I don't need to be verbose on these. Just imagine the potential of short rib and bone marrow potstickers, and that is what you will get when you order these. They have an excellent sear on one side to make the texture great as well.<br><br>4 - XIAO LONG BAO (Shrimp and goat soup dumplings)<br>These were really good soup dumplings, but if you are only getting one order of dumplings I would go for the Jiaozi. My ULTIMATE recommendation though would be to order both. You can never have too many dumplings...<br><br>5 - GOAT AND DUCK SPRINGROLL<br>These were very basic, but tasty. They are skinny roles, fried, with two dipping sauces. There's probably not much inside the rolls besides the goat and duck. <br><br>6 - XI'AN GOAT SLAP NOODLES<br>This was the showstopper, the dish I have dreamed about since my visit. My wife and I were practically stabbing each other with our chopsticks over the second helping of this dish. If you like sichuan flavors you MUST order this. It's not super numbing, but it is spicy. The meat was tender and perfect, and the cumin spice + sichuan peppercorn was heavenly. The noodles were slathered in all of that flavor and were cooked perfectly.<br><br>7 - TWICE COOKED PORK<br>I enjoyed eating this, but it won't be at the top of my list to reorder. The pork is very delicious... fatty with a nice char... but the portion wasn't huge. It was mostly a pile of veggies on top of a couple small pork pieces. It all worked really well together, there were just other things I would repeat over this. <br><br>8 - GREEN BEANS IN BLACK BEAN SAUCE<br>The waiter recommended we get these to supplement all of our meat dishes. Vegetables... what a radical idea. If you don't generally like green beans don't let that prevent you from getting these. They are fried up with some crispy shallots and nuts, and are thoroughly delicious. <br><br>9 - PEKAN CHICKEN<br>The portion on this guy was huge. It was a platter full of crispy chicken, just topped with a few green onions and peppers. A lot of times sweet and sour sauce can be too sweet for me, but this one walked the line well. This is a great dish to order if you're sharing, because everyone will like it regardless of how picky they are, and again you get a lot of chicken.<br><br>10 - DUCK FRIED RICE<br>Before you start judging the amount of food we got, we didn't technically order this. We kept it in the single digits people!! The kitchen made an extra by accident, and we ended up with this as a little bonus. I'm not mad about it. I finished it off even though we had PLENTY of food between the four of us between the first 9 things we ordered. I may have rolled out of there but I regret nothing.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/d805wM5C_W2YUsnC82fJ3g/348s.jpg", "caption": "Green Beans in black bean sauce"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/X0sbipKURf3NCupAjrmhRA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Duck fried rice"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tzORE8-URJjF9XxLYJFkGA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Twice cooked pork.

And mind you that is w/ the crazy amount of seating they have. This place is decorated in a variety of ways, all of which reminded of being back in Asia all over again. When you step into this establishment if you're not in awe of it, check your pulse. <br><br>If you check out the menu online, it doesn't seem to reflect everything that they have in house. I say this as we ordered the duck hearts that were prepared perfectly. Hearts are like octopus, they can be messed up to be too chewy like rubber or the complete opposite. It's finding the happy place and boy did they find it. SO GOOD!<br><br>For our entrees, which mind you everything here is designed to be shared, we selected CHONGQING CHICKEN( Sichuan-style chicken with chilis) & XI'AN GOAT SLAP NOODLES (Cumin, sichuan peppercorn, finger hot chili, goat shoulder). <br><br>The chicken was like fried chicken, double fried, smothered in chilis. It was too crunchy for us. Although it was smothered in peppers they weren't too hot. Now the noodles and goat shoulder, OMG, flavor town as Guy would say. <br><br>Do yourself a favor and make a reservation here to give your tastebuds a pampering of flavors. I give this place a 4.5!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I had been here once prior where we were seated in a quaint lounge area in the back but that was prior to my active Yelping life:) so while this review is about my recent dinning Experience in the main restaurant I will start off by saying I noticed off the bat a few things had changed. For one, they did away with the cute lounge. The waitress said it was to make more table space since they had become so popular and reduce wait times. Second, the DimSum menu was like half as many items and was told it's because they decided to revamp the entire menu a few months ago to only their top best selling dishes and added in some new things for guests to try. Our waitress has been there a while so she obviously knew the scoop, and she was excellent with prompt service and suggesting some items to try. It was evident she enjoyed her job and was passionate about the menu. You go girl!<br><br>The ambiance is fantastic and each adjoining room of the restaurant revealed a well thought out eclectic interior style. We were seated in the back right by the Kitchen window so it was cool watching everything pass by but if I had to pick, the red front room with the umbrella shades is everything and more! Seems Asia-Meets-French Bisto inspired. <br><br>The one thing I major disliked is how cramped the tables are to each other!! Getting in or out of a wall bench was a delicate act of not getting your rump in the next tables face and not causing a table to wobble. Most guests are adults so a few more inches would feel more practical - please and thank you.<br><br>Everything is intended for \"Family Style\" dinning which means you order several dishes and share them across the table. That works but know that it may take a number of orders (or double up) because I didn't feel the portions were all that generous - all very tasty and fresh but not enough to share with more than one or two others IMO.<br><br>Duck Duck Goat (DDG) lives in the rising upbeat Fulton Market neighborhood and is best known for their Beef Slap Noodles ($17) so regardless of what else you decide upon, definitely do order those up!! More on the savory side but the shishito garnish gives it a kick! <br><br>Tried the Xiao Long Bao soup dumplings ($12) which come in a DimSum steam basket 5 to an order but they were only meh honestly. They were cold and stuck to the bottom of the basket so a light tug and all the warm soupey goodness drained out of the won ton before I could get it to my mouth... sad face, they were really tasty though. <br><br>The pork buns ($12) came 2 to an order and were gigantic but they had far too much dough for my liking and not much meat inside. Also I had asked the food runner dude (our waitress was taking another table's order) for some hot mustard but he said they didn't have any which I thought was wierd because the adjacent table had some. Thankfully our waitress came by to refill water glasses and see if we neeeded anything else and promptly brought the hot mustard. <br><br>We ordered the Pork Fried Rice ($15) but I totally failed to take a picture. I thought it was a tad too salty for my enjoyment so I didn't have much of it. <br><br>Otherwise, to me the little things like cute little bowls for sauces, ECO-conscious wooden mini-spoons, the cute DDG cartoon on the To-Go boxes made for a unique experience... and a sweet end to it all was having the almond cookies (sans the fortune) instead of a typical fortune cookie. I'd say the pricing was in line with most other Asian places in the area but I'd say less authentic, more trendy but still worth a Foodies try! <br><br>Oh and don't worry if you happen to over-order because leftovers will make you happy you did!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9oaLzqPCWrdbozeZL8TwHg/348s.jpg", "caption": "Asian art adorned these walls..."}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MewM78qA2z6xbH45gipbrg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Festive bar!!"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "So this amazing and famous chef creates her magic again with Asian mostly Chinese cuisine this time.

Definitely make a reservation before going to be safe cause it's pretty popular. We preferred the appetizers over our shared entree, and I wasn't a huge fan of the dessert (my hubby was though and it was his day). The appetizers were so yummy though, I really wouldn't mind just having appetizers here every freaking day. Shrimp Toast, Jiaozi, and spring rolls? Let me at em. I do wish that we had tried the Peking duck, but just for the two of us when we were going to be walking around afterward, just didn't make sense. The waiter was very attentive, which helped make my husbands birthday extra special. Can't wait to try more from here!!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "My experience at Duck Duck Goat can be described in one word- SALTY! And not in the well seasoned kind of salty. More of the so much salt it rubs your tongue raw and pinches your lips. Â <br><br>My husband and I decided to come here for dinner on a chilly but beautiful Wednesday around 6:30 without a reservation. The inside was packed but they had one of those heat lamps so naturally we opted to sit on their cute little sidewalk patio. Â <br><br>To start we both agreed to the beef wonton soup, Â it came in a large thick shareable pot. Â The soup was much heavier than your traditional wonton broth, it was dense and well seasoned. Â It reminded me more of a ramen broth. Â Although the wontons were a bit sparse, they were beautifully made with the most tender filling. Â Same for the gyoza!<br><br>We then decided to split the green beans, chicken fried rice, and chicken. Â Although the fried rice had cherry tomatoes it in, it was over salted and even the acidity of the tomatoes wasn't enough to brighten it. Â I did enjoy the texture though, some well cooked rice and some crunchy. Â <br><br>We hoped that the green beans would add some freshness to our meal, but they were heavily seasoned and all we could taste was salt. Â <br><br>The chongquing chicken was different from what we expected. Â We thought it would be coated in a sauce but instead it was dusted with seasoning. Â The sauces that came on the side were rather bland.<br><br>Over all, I thought the meal as a whole was one note and missing acidity and freshness. Â It was plenty of food that we ended up boxing up.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RYuA3nWlZqfKyO3OtM2BRA/348s.jpg", "caption": "Beef Wonton"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BatpGEiz8hiTustxN41cjg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Potstickers beef"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9pNmn-Zfapg0dIumVhlZDQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Chongqing Chicken"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Went on a Wednesday night and it was a long wait for a table but we were able to snag two seats at the bar right away and just ate there. Â The bar tender was nice and offered good suggestions. The tea I had was good. They do whole leaf or flower tea and brew it themselves. Â We got the goat and shrimp soup buns which were really good and served at a good temperature so we didn't burn our mouth. Â The spicy chicken has great flavor and was crispy on the outside but tender inside. Â I felt there should've either been half as many peppers or twice as much chicken as the ratio seemed a little off. Â I got about 5 pieces of chicken and ate 4 of each type of pepper and my husband did the same and there still a plate full of peppers. Â The shrimp toast was my absolute favorite just so many flavors and great texture, but for those of you who don't like cilantro it does have cilantro. Â We also got the green beans which we how I now think all green beans should be cooked. The black bean paste have a nice flavor to it and the cashews and crispy shallots rounded out the flavors and texture. Â We tried the pot stickers too which weren't really my thing but bone marrow and short ribs aren't really foods I care for to begin with. My husband thought they were good, not amazing but good. <br>All 5 dishes and 2 drinks were just over $100 and we left completely full.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Great place for a casual date night or dinner w friends.

Darn.<br><br>I'm going to start with I LOVE the decor. Each room that you want into has a slightly different theme than the one before it. There's a bar kind of in the middle, right in front of the kitchen that kind of reminds you of an outdoor restaurant in Southeast Asia. We were in the red room with a great view (great for people watching) of the sidewalk outside. Not that you should ever need to people watch, but my friend and I were just a little out of it from our 4 hours of sleep the night before. <br><br>The service is great. The server we had, Sarah, was awesome. She had some great recommendations. We got there about 1/2 an hour before the end of brunch and were able to order a few items off that menu and then also order off their regular dinner menu. Yay! We were even more excited. Food came out fairly quick. We were told that that it would come out in waves and that our table would never be void of food, but it actually came out faster than anticipated and we had too much food, at times, on the table. Maybe we were eating slower than their usual guest...we were hoping it would actually be a little more casual/slower though.<br><br>The food:<br>Jiazo - beef short rib and bone marrow potstickers (5 per order). These were delicious. It really did melt in your melt as our server said it would. The meat inside had great flavor and they were well filled. The sauce was awesome that came with it. <br><br>Beef Slap Noodles - short rib ragu, luobo radish. We were told by some friends and our server that these were a must get....so we got them. They are delicious. The noodles are big and wide and totally taste like their homemade. The ragu mixed and melted well with the noodles. The only downside was that ours came out quite salty. Because of that, I'm not sure I would order them again before I tried something else first. <br><br>Green Beans in Black Bean Sauce - our server said this was one dish she didn't let her customer leave without getting so we had to try it. We were not disappointed. The beans aren't necessarily crunchy like you might think...or like you may have had at Girl and Goat, but OMG the flavor is soo good. You get a very healthy portion and the sauce is amazing. The cashews were awesome, as was the crunch of the fried garlic/onions on top. These were a tad salty also, but not so much as the Beef Slap Noodles.<br><br>Taiwanese Pineapple Cakes (brunch only) - these were a sweet and delcious sweet treat. The cake itself was a little dry (kind of corn muffin dry), but the pineapple on the inside definitely helps and it was delicious. A little frosty or sauce would've been perfect...maybe a little whipped cream.<br><br>Taiwanese Fried Chicken (brunch only) - with char siu sauce and garlic aioli. These didn't seem like anything super special honestly, but they were one of the items that were on the brunch menu only. It's strips of fried chicken. Great with the char siu sauce. A healthy portion...and the left overs served cold on a salad is great or just great to snack on... kind of like popcorn chicken, but bigger pieces.

Make sure to eat these using your spoon and let them cool off a bit so you don't burn your tongue on the trapped steam!

The egg doesn't look as broken up flowery as the traditional one, but taste wise, it was great<br>- Ham sui gok: the goat dumpings. This was a pretty gamey dumping and it was an awesome surprise with the punch in flavor from the meat compared to the traditional ground pork<br>- Xiao long bao: again with the twist of goat, which made the broth within even more flavorful. Beware, the skin is thin, so unfortunately there were some breakage at our table<br>- Green beans: This is a favorite at any Chinese restaurant for me, but somehow Duck Duck Goat was able to elevate this dish where it doesn't taste quite as greasy, but still maintains some of the traditional and wonderful black bean sauce flavor<br>- Duck fried rice: So fun to break the duck egg over the rice! I will say that the consistency of the fried rice could have had a bit more of a bite, it was a bit one note in texture<br>- Beef slap noodles: I love the thick noodles that look hand pulled and short ribs over it was saucy and delicious<br>- Branzino special: This is a take of sorts on the ginger and scallions steamed fish. but with mushrooms, which made it earthy. The meat was moist and it was awesome to put that over the fried rice<br>- Jian dui donut holes: generally I am a sucker for jian dui and reading the menu where it said \"sesame whip\" I was even more excited, but really it was just little donut hole sized jian dui (sesame balls) that didn't have a filling, and really good whipped cream, but it was not sesame flavored.

Went there with 2 other friends. Ordered 2 appetizers, the bone marrow potstickers - Jiazo, very, very good and the Xiao Long Bao, steamed baos but filled with a soup, think little bags of soup. A 1st for me, but very tasty. We also ordered as an appetizer the Dan Dan noodles. Think noodles with a peanut flavored bolognese. Rich and flavorful. The appetizers were over $11 dollars each with $15 for the noodles. For main dish we shared a Peking Duck, that at $59 looked expensive, but it ended up being a deboned, nicely presented bird and a fairly large. Flavor was on point. Not greasy as this dish regularly is with a very crispy skin. <br><br>Service was really good with very knowledgefull waiters who really knew the menus and could explain them really well<br><br>This place is an interesting dining option that is pretty singular, at least it was for me. Be ready for an over $100 dollar bill. Our meal was around $165 with tip. My only issue is that I think you can find relatively similar food in chinatown for more than half.

This is the most ridiculous place to ever try and call itself fine dining. In short, reservations mean nothing here and the food is barely edible. Not worth the money, not even worth going for the experience.<br><br>We called over two hours in advance to reserve a table for two at 10:00pm on a Saturday night which was their earliest availability. We came in around 9 to see if they had any earlier tables or at least let them know we were in the area so we could be checked in. We went up the street to the arcade to wait for the reservation and went back at 9:45. At that point the hostess was telling us the people where we were supposed to be sat were done eating but were just sitting there. At that time another party of two walked in saying they had a reservation. They waited a while as well but chose to leave out of the place. Then another party of two came in with or without a reservation. Somehow both of these two parties were sat before us by another hostess that was clearly in contact with our hostess even though we were there and checked in first for 10:00pm. Keep in mind there is no way these people had a 9:30 or 9:45 reservation because when we called at 8:00 the only opening was for 10:00 and had the others had an earlier slot they would have arrived prior to 9:45 which they had not. I'm pretty sure reservations work by what tables are available not by, oh I want you to sit here so no matter what other tables we have open you have to sit at this one spot. So we were sat at a tabletop to keep us from waiting any longer which is right at the bar and I'm pretty sure it is bar seating until they put the reserved sign on it. If we wanted to sit at the tabletop we would have sat there when we came in at 9. So now we waited all this time for nothing. To add insult to injury the hostess then tries to sit someone at our tabletop as if it was not our reservation at this point. Furthermore, I saw several open tables where we could have been seated at.<br><br>The wait staff here is really nice, that's about the only positive thing I can say about this place. We ordered the beef and bone marrow wontons, chicken rice noodles, and duck fried rice. Everything was really overpriced for the portion and just overall quality of the food. Nothing was particularly hot, I would not be surprised if it was microwave food. It probably would have been better if we had gotten frozen Chinese from target, that's how bad and funky the food tasted. Nothing spectacular about any of the dishes, all of them had the same grease and smoke taste except some were sweet and some were salty. There was barely any duck in the fried rice and I'm not sure what kind of \"salted\" the egg was but there was no flavor to it besides grease and water. While I was eating the rice there was this huge chunk of some kind of minty seed in the food that was so hard and big that it hurt my mouth and I had to spit the entire bite of food out. That ruined any hope left for the dish. The only remotely interesting thing was that the rice noodles in the chicken had an good texture. The only worthwhile things we ordered were the drinks which came out of a can. While we were waiting for the waiter to come and pack our food and get the check the bartender took eaten food left at the bar and put it on our table as if she could not pick the plate up, wipe the counter, and put it back down. What part of fine dining is that?<br><br>If you just want to try a new place I suggest eating somewhere else and only come here for a small plate and drinks.

Â The ambience is romantic with nice decor. The food is pretty good and the service is excellent. <br><br>You should definitely get reservation because the place was packed when we went. My friend and I got the beef soup, the pecan chicken, and beef noodles. We also got some of their emperor pu'erh tea. <br><br>The beef soup was TERRIBLE. Seriously, I get that the broth is supposed to bed salty, but ours was inedible. There's was 0 flavor and just tasted like they'd poured a bottle of soy sauce over some beef and veggies and dumplings and called it a day. Skip this one at all costs. <br><br>The chicken was delicious! It was crispy and coated in a delicious sauce. The pecans were a nice addition. <br><br>My personal favorite dish was the beef noodles. The sauce was so good and the beef was nice and tender. <br><br>The portions sizes are deceptively small. My friend and I got 3 dishes but we were full after eating the chicken and the beef noodles (we couldn't finish the disgusting soup). <br><br>The tea was also super delicious.<br><br>Btw, the take next to us got the whole duck which looked incredible, but wasn't practical for my friend and i to get because there was only 2 of us. I wish they would make a smaller portion available for small parties.

Unfortunately, in an effort to branch out and order some different dishes, I ended up picking some options that weren't as good as we were hoping. Boys suck, don't they?<br><br>Anyway. We started off with the fermented veggies, which were just bad. They were really sour, and the vegetables they used were just so weird. Like pickled green beans and cauliflower? I was expecting a lighter, sweeter dish like the one at traditional Taiwanese/Chinese restaurants, but this was not it at all. The jiaozi, or beef short rib and bone marrow potstickers, were amazing. The outside wrapping was so crispy and the bone marrow helped make the filling so creamy and rich, and the soy sauce-like sauce was just the perfect dressing. The wood-fired char siu ribs were not my girlfriend's favorite, but I enjoyed them. There was a lot of bone, however, and not much meat. It's similar to the Wuxi ribs dish served at Chinese restaurants, but not as sweet. I enjoyed them, I just wish there wasn't such a huge hunk of bone!<br><br>We also ordered the veggie fried rice which was great. It was a bit oily and salty, but great nonetheless. The kicker, though, was the almonds!! Such an interesting texture with the chewy rice. Finally, we got the green beans in black bean sauce which was also excellent. This was probably the closest to a traditional dish, minus the crispy onion straws, which were actually a really good addition!<br><br>Overall, this place is NOT a Chinese restaurant. Unfortunately, I was unable to put aside my expectations for these dishes, so I was left longing for more. However, Duck Duck Goat has certainly managed to put its own twist on Chinese food and add a unique flavor. The food is excellent, and I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and come back, with better options -- and letting my girlfriend order instead ;)", "pics": null}}]}
