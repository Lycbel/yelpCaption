With Ribfest going on just around the corner it was expected. I've been wanting to come here for awhile now and finally made it. <br><br>I started off with my usual go to Pad Kee Mao. I had asked for a little bit more spicier than usual, but I'm pretty sure they misunderstood my request because I got a dish that didn't have any spice to It whatsoever. Despite that, the dish was phenomenal. There's nothing chili powder can't fix. The dish had so many intense flavors, the beef cooked to perfection and the tomatoes and carrots added to enhance the dish and cool down the heat. You can also taste the Thai basil within every bite. I really did wish I could have more despite me already being full. My wife ordered her usual pad see ew and it also tasted delicious. Not really sure why most Thai places don't offer sticky rice with mango as a dessert, but fortunately for Sticky Rice, they did offer some sticky rice. And was a pleasant way to end your meal with. A warm delicious sweet sticky rice with slices of fresh mango!<br><br>I would say they were consistently slow throughout our meal. They didn't check up on us, I had to call and ask for the chili powder. When we were done with our entrees, they gave us our check without asking if we wanted dessert. And then to get our check finally after that seemed like forever. And then paying was another 10 minutes. The food was fantastic, if they could improve on the above, they'd get 5 Stars for sure.

I do want to give this place a second try though on their normal Thai cuisine.<br><br>I was intrigued by their offering of northern Thai food and good reviews, so we stopped here for lunch. They have an extensive menu (10 pages), from it we ordered items not typically found at most Thai places, just because. <br><br>Fried stuffed calamari - very interesting. Instead of cutting it into ring shapes then fried, the calamari that we all are familiar with, they stuffed it with ground chicken and other good things, then fried it. Think of it almost like a sausage, but with calamari as the casing. Very good flavor from the chicken stuffing and light crunchy batter. For the adventurous eaters out there, give this a try. <br><br>Thai pork salapao - basically a baozi with a Thai twist on the stuffing. I find it a bit dry on the inside, but the flavor is there. <br><br>Northern Thai combo - a good way to try some of the northern Thai dishes they offer. Highlight is the Nam prik nhum and the northern Thai sausage. Nam prik nhum is comparable to a bolognese, but with Thai seasoning. The northern Thai sausages I tasted lemongrass and curry seasonings, it was very flavorful, however dry. The dish was served with sticky rice, already delicious by itself, it was even more delicious when eaten with the nam prik nhum. <br><br>Vegetable soup - flavorful broth filled with plentiful veggies. I originally ordered it as a palate cleanser but ended up really liking it. <br><br>Thai custard - custard made with mung bean. Good overall, couldn't really taste the mung bean though.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cBp7rBAqWlKs6LwuamxDWg/348s.jpg", "caption": "Vegetable soup"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5Rwd8RGkmN8dxO508JN11A/168s.jpg", "caption": "Thai custard and Thai tea ice cream"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4ZEk_vTIWAfaQQpJg_ao2w/168s.jpg", "caption": "Vibe"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Been here a few times.

Just the right amount of sweetness and perfectly sticky. Good when paired with sticky rice. <br><br>The best thing we had, however, was the dessert. <br>I tried the durian with sticky rice.

During our visit, the atmosphere of this small establishment was quiet and unassuming. The dÃ©cor included bright colored walls and a number of cultural artifacts. There were plenty of tables closely stacked, and enough sunlight to keep the place vibrant and well lit. <br><br>For appetizer, the Basil Pork Salapao ($1.75) and the Panang Beef Salapao ($1.75) were flat out delicious. The buns were freshly made, not too thick, and doughy enough to render a good chew. There was plenty of basil pork stuffing that came with a flagrant basil aroma. Equally addictive was the beef rendition with a sharp, complex curry flavor. I could have eaten a few more of these, and can't wait to return to try their BBQ Pork Salapao.<br><br>The Northern Thai Larb ($8.95) came with stir-fried ground pork, pork intestine, fried shallots, and Thai spicy herb serve with fresh veggies. The spicy savory profile was explosive, and nicely accompanied by a good number of fresh veggies. It was a heavier dish than expected, but the range of textures and flavors nicely contrasted our serving of Sticky Rice ($1.75).<br><br>The Gang Hung Lay ($9.50) was cooked with pork, garlic, ginger, and northern style hung lay chili paste. There was a good amount of pork cooked in a range of rich, sharp, and complex ingredients. In particular, the hung lay curry flavor was spicy and complex, and nicely embedded in the pork which was thick cut and easy to chew.<br><br>Service was patient, friendly, and attentive. Overall, I thought the dishes were authentically executed, and spicy enough that we didn't have to use the side of prik nam pla.

Ok no big deal. Maybe not a talker. She watched us struggle with 1000 item menu and didn't come offer to help at all. We didn't really know what to get, and were gunna try Thai items that we usually do not get. I heard great things of their authenticity. We ordered 2 northern that sausages (1 would have been enough), large Tom Yum (small would have done), larb chicken, kai soi, pad Thai, nam prik king, and fried rice.

Sausage. Damn good and almost gamey. The soup. Eh. Average. Larb. Worst larb I ever ate. Not sure what the crunchy crap in there was, but it had to go. And not enough lime flavor. Kai Soi. I've had better and more authentic tasting (per someone who tried dan Thai and frequents Thailand often). Prik king. It was ok. The pad Thai. Average again. The fried rice was damn good though<br><br>So when it came to packing up leftovers, we tried to help her out by giving her 1 or 2 dishes at a time as we continued to eat other things.

Signaled over a coworker, and told her out outrageous request.

This is absolutely NOT the place where you can expect to be waited on hand-and-foot. You get a very real-world, non-Westerner level of service here. But what else are you expectin', huh? The menu provided is beyond massive, and, at 12 or so plus, small-printed pages, their menu is a bonafide tome of both standard, pretty typical Thai cuisine like Tom Yum soup, Pad Thai, and Pad See Ew and then the adventurous and fun stuff (aka Northern Thai food).<br><br>Do yourself a dang favor and get fun! Be adventurous! Do you want the real deal? Do you want to try traditional, yet flavorful foods? Then please, for the love of food, honestly, do try the Northern Thai-centric menu. Sure. Sure. Sure. You can go safe and go the Pad Thai route (which -- truth be told -- I tend to go that way myself). But why deny yourself a potentially grand adventure? Try something different. <br><br>Let me break it down for you in a 3 Step Plan:<br><br>1. For your first dunk into the Northern Thai menu, go dip your toe lightly into the shallow end and try the Northern Thai sausage -$3 a piece. It is a mild, red curry accented pork sausage with pork skin and spicy herbs and served with slivered red cabbage, ginger, and minced cilantro. In short, it is the perfect introductory appetizer for any newbies. <br><br>2. Next, for those feeling braver, may I suggest the Nam Prik Ong -$8.95- and a side of sticky rice -$1.75. The Nam Prik Ong is a traditional Northern Thai, bit viscous, chili-based, pork and tomato dip that is served with chopped broccoli, carrots, green beans, and cabbage leaves. Sticky Rice describes it as a \"Northern Thai version of bolognese\"... And guess what??? It totally was like a Thai bolognese. Using your hands to shape a small round of sticky rice, you scoop up some of the Nam Prik Ong. And experience a totally addictive, tomato-y, porky, delicate, yet smoky whisper of spice. Not at all overwhelmingly so. Eat. This. Now.<br><br>3. When you're ready to leave the shallow end, go plunge to the deep end. Seriously, submerge yourself. And try the Nam Crispy Rice - $8.50. The Nam Crispy Rice (i.e. Naem Khao Thawt or Nam Kao Tod) is a Thai salad that consists of crumbled, crispy, curried rice croquettes, fermented pork sausage (naem), slivered pork skin, dried chilies, shallots, cilantro, shredded carrot and ginger, and peanuts scattered over a bed of red lettuce. And, man, oh, man, is it the best damn salad ever. The tang of the fermented pork sausage + the freshness of the cilantro + the soft bite of the ginger + the gentle heat of the chilies + the beautiful interplay of textures from the crispy rice croquettes and everything else = pure, unadulterated food bliss. <br><br>Once you forego the standard fare and try the fun side of Northern Thai cuisine, you won't want to go back.
