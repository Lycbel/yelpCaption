The hulled out pineapple is filled with yogurt and their house-made granola then topped with the fresh fruit and nuts. It is heavenly delicious EXCEPT one note- the yogurt is NOT SWEET. I was assuming it would be sweetened vanilla yogurt but no, and the fruit is not sweet enough at this time of year to give me the sweetness I wanted so I had my leftovers at home with honey. <br><br>I also wanted something savory and wanted to try one of the small plates too. Luckily they didn't disappoint. The pancake of the month was a potato pancake topped with cheese sour cream and green onions, so I ordered that.

The food was awesome. I had been in Chicago for 2 days and friends, locals and tourist kept recommending this place . We decided to check it out and it was awesome well worst it.<br><br>Thank you", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Great place to grab a hearty breakfast at a reasonable price. I got the combo. Two eggs, 2 sausages,2 slices of bacon and 2 pancakes. I was concerned that I would be late for a spa appointment. However my food was prepared quickly. My waitress was attentive even though she was also serving a large table of  CPD officers.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I was here for brunch with a friend and, first off, no reservations - but also no line, when we arrived around 12:30. I hate, hate, hate waiting for food (probably because I always wait until I'm already hungry to start thinking about it). <br><br>We split the breakfast combo platter and the chicken and waffle. This is the first place I've been where the chicken was deboned, which made the eating experience much easier, but also slightly less delicious. I'm a traditional kind of girl, and you just can't get as much crunch on a deboned chicken breast as you can at KFC, I'm sorry. <br><br>For that reason, I'm going to have to chop you. <br><br>That's a joke, I'll probably be back. The thing about Yolk, though, is that the the menu is so big and everything sounds so delicious that I keep telling myself, \"Next time I come back - I'll find it. My perfect breakfast.\" Hasn't happened yet, but I'll probably keep trying.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This place did NOT disappoint. And when you come visit as a New Yorker, these prices do not disappoint either. It was very spacious and my party of 2 did not have to worry about making a reservation at all when we went on Friday right before noon. We both were very complicated with our orders, but our waitress was REALLY patient and answered all our questions. The only thing that could have been better was when I ordered the combo, I could only substitute the bacon with all turkey sausages (which will now come with 4 instead of the 2). I wish there were more options such as ham, home fries, etc., but because it was the combo, there couldn't be changes made. The sweet crepes I upgraded to (nutella) were amazing as well (though the little chopped nuts on top tasted a little stale) and I was very surprised with the portions. I thought everything would be less since it was a big combo, but nope! Had two crepes, four turkey sausages, two eggs, and added smashed avocado on the side for less than a dollar extra. The cinnamon roll was also massive enough to split between two people, but I would say it wasn't that impressive unless you're absolutely craving that specifically. Lucky for Chi dwellers, there are multiple spots as this is a chain so it certainly makes it easier to access regardless which neighborhood you are coming from.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Ordered delivery to our office.

The portions are huge and I love that the place has plenty of seating. My sister got the French toast with the berries and it was delicious. I opted for the works omelette with a side of fruit- also great. The omelette was perfectly cooked but given the large portion, I could only finish half of it (thankfully I had help finishing it so it didn't go to waste). <br><br>I wished I lived locally so I could come back more often but I'm from California.
