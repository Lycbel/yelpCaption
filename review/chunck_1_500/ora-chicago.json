Luckily, Uptown/ Montrose has a ton of bars that are perfect for learning the art of patience. <br><br>We wanted to grab a few beers at Hopleaf (across the street), while waiting. However, it was packed shoulder to shoulder with beer patrons. So, we settled on Simon's Tavern (cash only), which was empty. Music from the late 90s was playing, but not too loud that we couldn't hear our conversations. The bartender was attentive and the drinks were cheaper. After an hour, our names were called for Ora. <br><br>First impressions:<br>Warm and contemporary atmosphere. Limited seating. Lively vibe. BYOB! We stopped at Andersonville Wine & Spirits beforehand because it's right across the street. Right away, our server put our assorted six-pack of Whiner Beer (yum!) cans on ice. Our waters were always filled. We chose all the suggestions that our server recommended, and they were fantastic. Even though it was so busy, our server kept up with us. Five stars.<br><br>Food:<br>+Oyster Motoyaki $13, Japanese Egg Sauce, Flying Fish Roe, Garlic Citrus Soy Sauce, Baked Oysters. Presented in shooter sized cup. Creamy like mashed potatoes with a oyster consistency. It was a burst of flavors in my mouth. Worth experiencing.<br>+Dynamite Signature Roll $14, Baked Scallop, Tempura, Asparagus, Spicy Tuna, Cream Cheese, Wasabi cream, Soy Sauce. The cream cheese combined with the scallop was delectable and full of texture.<br>+Sashimi set $23, Seven pieces of chef's choice. No complaints if you like raw fish.<br>+Albacore Tataki $15, Seared Albacore Tuna, Soft Shell Crab, Spicy Tuna, Cucumber, Avocado, Sauce. I didn't care for this one, but my husband, who goes out of his way to order Sashimi, loved it. <br>+Miso Soup $3, Scallions, Nori, Tofu. Complex flavor, not your ordinary Miso.<br>+Surf and Turf $14, Seared Beef, Garlic Aioli, Shrimp Tempura, Cream Cheese, Scallion, Asparagus, Sweet Soy Sauce. This is my favorite Ora Roll. I don't even like beef, but it was so mouthwatering. Hits your taste buds with creamy rich flavors. <br>+Scallop Volcano $14, Spicy Scallop, Shrimp Tempura, Salmon, Cucumber, Asparagus, Grilled Scallions, Sweet Soy Sauce.

Â But I wanted to try Ora as I heard it was really delicious and I like that it's BYOB. Â The food here was absolutely delicious and high-quality. Â The service here though is a 2.5 stars. Â They don't seem to have their act quite together. Â It was a busy Saturday night. Â I made reservations ahead of time and we got there right in time for our reservations. Â We had to wait there for 30 minutes because they didn't have anything ready and two of their servers/staff members were kind of snippy telling us to wait in a corner and telling my friend to wait in a separate part of the room in an abrupt way. Â I understand the place is small, but this is a restaurant so they need to be nice to people who are already pissed off about having to wait when they made reservations. Â It's also too cold to wait outside when its 38 degrees. Â <br><br>One of the servers was very nice though and was a stark contrast to most of the other servers we interacted with there. Â He was our primary server and kept apologizing for the wait. Â The wine glasses took forever to come out and he just brought one of them out after we waited abut 15 minutes already because he said the other glasses were still drying. Â They need to order more wine glasses then because it was a long wait to just have glasses served. Â Our server just seemed completely overwhelmed and it took him awhile to come back with things. Â The guy who was taking our plates was kind of rude though and we asked him nicely for a cork to open our wine bottle and he never brought it, he was basically rushing us and taking plates away without asking whether they were ready. Â It's kind of a pet peeve of mine since I am a slow eater. Â <br><br>The food on the other hand was excellent. Â We ordered the highly recommended Oyster Motoyaki. Â It was basically oysters soaked in an egg custard with garlic flakes, ponzu and green onion sprinkled on top with a soy vinaigrette. Â It was baked and oozing with flavor. Â This dish definitely lived up to the hype and is an extremely unique dish conceptually.<br><br>We decided to share some Maki and ordered the: Scallop Volcano roll, Smoke Eye roll, and Dynamite roll. Â All of these rolls had remarkable flavors with a multiplicity of textures. Â The Scallop Volcano roll was my favorite as it had smoked salmon, shrimp tempura, grilled scallions, a soy reduction, and spicy scallops on top. Â All of the flavors balanced out very well into an extremely satisfying large bite of food. Â The Smoke Eye roll was unique and mouthwateringly delicious as well. Â My favorite part of it was the seared eel as adds a nice salty flavor to the shiitake, tiger prawn, wasabi aioli, and fish stick bits. Â There was a lot of umami in this roll. Â It is also finished up nicely with a soy reduction. Â The Dynamite roll had that perfect crunchy texture complementing the soft baked scallops on top. It came with asparagus, tuna, and cream cheese. Â Fortunately, the cream cheese did not dominate the flavors as it does sometimes at other sushi restaurants. Â It tasted fresh and I enjoyed all of the tempura flakes. Â <br><br>I am a firm believer in trying a sushi restaurant's nigiri or sashimi because that is the purest way to really assess the quality of their fish and rice. Â I ordered the smoked mackerel nigiri. Â I thought the rice was nicely sticky (I am not an expert on sushi rice though). Â The smoked mackerel was light, delicate, and subtly smoked. Â <br><br>Since we had to wait awhile for everything and the service was a bit rough, our server was kind of enough to serve us a spicy tuna maki on the house, which was very appreciated. Â It had a completely different set of flavors from the maki we previous tried and I really enjoyed the spice of the tuna. Â It was a very satisfying roll. Â <br><br>I do think the sushi here is really spectacular and it is affordable for a high quality sushi place, especially since it's BYOB. Â Their service needs to improve though because 2/3 people that we interacted with were not very nice and the slowness of everything really took away from the experience.

My parents can be somewhat challenging at restaurants with their 500 questions or modifications, and he was so patient and kind with them the whole night. I ordered the salmon/hotate sushi, a salmon maki roll, and spicy scallop roll. The hotate was very good, and while the spicy scallop roll was tasty and I happily ate it all, I'd probably skip it next time for an additional salmon roll. It just kind of lost the scallop taste with everything else mixed in (I like plain, boring rolls/sushi). The salmon roll was outstanding! It's a roll every sushi place can make, but I think judging a place based on the basics really shows how good (or not) they are. These were amazing - the salmon was fresh, and the ratio of salmon to rice was perfect... not overloading rice to save the restaurant some cash. I could have just ordered three (or seven?) of those and been totally content.<br><br>Everyone else with me was likewise satisfied with their food. Julio had very highly recommended the beef tataki appetizer to us when we first sat down. Nothing about it sounded great to me, and I'm not really a beef person... and I'm still not entirely sure what beef tataki is. BUT, we ordered it anyway, and it was amazing!

It may seem pricey but you get your money's worth!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "INCREDIBLE OMAKASE <br>I tried Omakase as executed by Master Chef and owner, Dalbert. This was definitely the way to go! The best way I could describe it is as a beautiful melody that unfolded into a symphony. His selection was exquisite and the fish was extremely flavorful and fresh. One of my favorites was his unforgettable Oyster Motoyaki. I wish I could eat this every day it was absolute HEAVEN. It was creamy and crisp, rich and slightly sweet. I highly recommend Ora to any sushi lover the quality is beyond and you will be blown away!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Food is very good. Service is unreliable. We were there with a reservation for 5 on a fairly busy night, it took 2.5 hours from start to finish of our meal. There were 15-20 minutes between each of the rolls coming out, with no visits from servers in between. Eventually when over half an hour passed and we were still waiting on two more, we politely went to ask what was up. Our food had been delivered to the wrong table, so they were making them again. But we had to seek them out to get that information. Truly, the food is very tasty. But either it was a rough night with some inexperienced servers, or they have some serious gaps in the organization of their kitchen/servers. And the next morning we discovered they'd charged our card twice, so this experience didn't leave a good taste in my mouth.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Nothing stood out to me here unfortunately.

After exploring the north shore sushi scene, we feel confident in claiming Ora to be our favorite sushi spot!<br>We usually get a regular maki roll and a special maki roll each. This is more than enough food and adds up to about $22 each. I think this is very reasonable for such high quality sushi!<br>The regular maki are characterized by their fresh and crisp flavors. If you want a clean and vibrant focus on the meat flavor, the regular rolls are the best option. Plus they are half the price of the special rolls. Tonight I got the escolar jalapeÃ±o. It was fresh, bright, and clean! <br>The special rolls are so scrumptious to the point of pure pleasure! They are creative and bursting with flavor. Tonight I got the Snake eye which combined unagi, prawn tempura, and a delectable blend of sauce and veggies. Plus, the presentation is absolutely stunning!<br>Furthermore, the decor is warm and inviting, as are the staff. The servers have always been extremely kind, helpful and attentive.<br>This is a great date spot!

Ora has become overcrowded, rushed and loud. Docked 2 stars for the last 4-5 visits that have been the latter. Although the affordable prices and BYOB option is alluring, we'd rather pay premium prices than deal with cramped quarters.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I would say, the best sushi in Chicago! very fresh fish, skilled sushi chef, friendly servers, reasonable pricing. I enjoyed my experience here at Ora. One big disappointment was the hot tea, vanilla pumpkin spice favored tea.I was not sure but it was not a green tea. It didn't go well with Sushi/Sashimi. There is a reason why a simple green tea (sen-cha/ban-cha) is served with Sushi. Green tea has tannins that are good for your digestive tract. It's also loaded with catechin antioxidants, and is believed to be effective in eliminating the bacteria vibrio, one of the leading causes of food poisoning. It's same idea as vinegary rice, wasabi, ginger. Everything else, I loved it. I will go back there again with my own green tea.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I had an unfortunate experience my first time here and I'm glad I gave Ora another shot. On my first visit, four of us waited a full hour for a table we reserved before being seated. The table we were supposed to get was done eating when we arrived, but continued to open another bottle of wine (thx BYOB), and the management did nothing until sixty minutes later when ANOTHER table cleared up and we were seated there. This time we also had a ten minute wait but it was less packed as it was earlier in the evening.<br><br>While on my last visit we were never brought any ice for our white wine, even after asking five times, we got some this time, although after being asked twice from different waiters. Combined with the small space and waiters twisting around tables, it can feel hectic. <br><br>But this place really redeems itself by its delectable signature rolls. You really can't go wrong, they're all unique, flavorful, consistently beautiful.

KM made it rain with a chirashi main - hefty assortment of fish layered over seasoned rice - though if you're feeling adventurous, get their spicy version - for $19, it's a fair amnt of food, unless you pound sush like I do.<br><br>They have 10ish fancy rolls, but after abt 4 ingredients my palate kind of dies a little, so we skipped those and indulged in salmon/avo, yellow tail/scallion, shitake/avo, tuna, and california rolls - all of which clocked in around $5-7 - the fancy rolls are closer to $12-15 - portions of fish were ample, the CA roll (w real crab, obs) had this amazing spice in it - not mayo - but something heavenly - and the black sesame seeds on the outside added a surprising, noticeable twist - oh, and and I had a few orders of nigiri too - the medai w ginger was unreallll - worth ordering a few non-maki options - though it's priced per piece, which is always a sad-face situation, but dear Lord is it worth it.<br><br>Din for 3 was around $65, which is quite reasonable given the amnt of food consumed - though it's much easier to spend more if you go all eel/tuna/salmon/spicy mayo/avo/unicorn sauce on your rolls. Noise is fairly aggressive - and the place gets packed - nevertheless, worth a visit, though service is fairly absent/shitty, so don't go hangry.<br><br>For non-sushi heathens, I think they even have a few cooked entrees/starters you can enjoy - giving me hope that maybe one of these days I'll drag the folks down here. After giving them a lil Xanax and telling them we're going to Joe's Stone Crab or something. B/c that's how I repay them for their unending love and support.

The atmosphere is intimate and warm, and service was very attentive and friendly, a perfect spot for date night or to catch up with a small group of friends (it seemed a bit small for larger groups.) The waitress started by suggesting special fish they had in stock that evening, which we loved (uni and smoked mackerel.) I highly recommend the oyster motoyaki (AMAZING) and beef tataki from the kitchen plates.The scallop volcano was also a standout. Extra points for BYOB. Can't wait to go back!
