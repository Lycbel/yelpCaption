The portions are big as they load it up with cabbage and other toppings. As a Mexican Taco snob, the flavors to these were so new to what a taco tastes like until I got to the meat. They do it right because they get the meat right and honestly all the flavors compliment each other. I approve. <br><br>I also had to try their wings since they looked so good. I think these are the best wings in the area, sorry Crisp fans. They only have one sauce for wings and it's a thicker and sticky sauce but it coats their wings well so be prepared to go through napkins. I pair these wings with a side of fries that come with an aioli. The aioli is light and good but I still prefer the sticky sauce of the wings so I'll dip the fries into that. <br><br>Overall like any hot restaurant in the area there can be a wait on a weekend night since, but they're pretty good at accommodating and also have take out.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This place certainly does have tasty food, but I'm extremely disappointed by the limited menu options here, especially for vegetarians.<br><br>Korean and Mexican are both cuisines that allow for a lot of variation and experimenting and can easily give produce vegetarian dishes.

Barring sides, there were two things that I could order which did not have meat.<br><br>The blackened tofu tacos were absolutely delicious, and if I am around the place I might stop in to get them but else if you're looking for vegetarian options, go anywhere else. The fries were pretty solid too.<br><br>What was also disappointing was that they had Banh Mi sandwiches, which I love, and didn't have a blackened tofu one. That in my opinion would have been a banger.<br><br>If you eat meat, I've heard people are pretty satisfied with the food here.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Sooooooooooooo disappointing. Like many, I saw the Triple D episode and wanted to try this place out. The place was clearly experiencing the Triple D bounce still as it was pretty busy around lunch but still managed to find a place to get seated (they will seat you after you order).<br><br>We got the kimchi fries, K-Town Chicken Wings, hot stone veggie bibimbap, miso soup (it was cold outside) and the kids BBQ plate with chicken.<br><br>Let me start with the \"Kid's\" BBQ plate. The only option for chicken is a spicy chicken - which is super weird. Our older kid can handle spicy but the younger one still has a little aversion to it. Fortunately it wasn't too spicy but why not offer a non-spicy chicken option for kids?<br><br>As for the rest of the food, let me start with the miso soup. It's a weird option to have at a Korean restaurant and for $1.95, I expected a little more than what seemed like instant miso soup with tiny tofu pieces. Yes we were cold and so it helped get us warm but we could've saved the $8 for 4 tofu soups.<br><br>The bibimbap was fine but nothing special for $12. The rice at the bottom did not crisp up as much as we like and the toppings were forgettable.<br><br>Next up was the chicken wings, the featured item on Triple D. WAY too much sauce. It felt like I was eating a candied apple. The sauce was a little too sweet and because the sauce was overwhelming, I could barely get a sense of the chicken itself. <br><br>Finally, the kimchi fries - the best item in our opinion. The kimchi had a good spicy and flavor. The pork belly added some nice flavor and didn't overpower the rest of the fries. Would have liked a little more crunch from the fries to hold up against all the cheese and sauce but overall a good item. Probably what saved this place from just being a plain bummer. I get that Korean may not be a big cuisine in Chicago, but coming from LA where you have an abundance of good, if not great Korean places, this place disappointed. <br><br>Unless you're a local who need a Korean food fix, you can skip this place.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZQrlRrDrHLo67ytj8uSYZw/348s.jpg", "caption": "Kimchi fries.

I was not unhappy with anything, and I wasn't blown away either. The concept and allure of the menu were more exciting than what was delivered.<br>__<br>I came in on Saturday around 1:30pm, and was surprised to find this place packed! It is counter serve, and the line was to the door when I got there. It didn't take too long to get up to the front and place an order, and my party was able to be seated right away after ordering (you can't get a table until you order).<br><br>We ordered: <br>Seoul Style Street Dumplings<br>K-town Chicken Wings<br>Kalbi Poutine<br><br>The chicken wings came out first. They were a mostly sweet with a touch of spicy, swimming in a sticky soy-based sauce. I would have enjoyed more garlic and chili (which the menu lists in the sauce), as both of those flavors were muted. I was also expecting more crunch from the breading, considering they were advertised as K-Town wings. The Korean wings I'm used to are double fried and super crunchy, but these seemed to be a normal single fry with a softer skin texture. The menu advertises these as \"jumbo\" wings, but I would call them normal sized based on my chicken wing experience, which is embarrassingly extensive. All in all, they were a fairly middle of the road asian-flavored chicken wing.<br><br>Next came the dumplings. These are larger than average dumplings, about the size of a golf ball and packed full of filling (there was no loose wrapping / extra space). They arrive piping hot and slippery, so you have to wait a minute to easily pick them up and also not burn yourself. The texture was pleasing, hearty with a little chew. The stuffing had both meat and I believe rice noodles inside. My beef (pun absolutely intended) is that they ate a little bland. The meat was a bit under-seasoned, even after using the dipping sauce.<br><br>The poutine arrived last. Unfortunately as designed, it eats like a basic, loaded baked potato. There was just way too much \"crema\" which tasted like regular sour cream. The dousing with crema, coupled with the green onions, just planted the baked potato similarity firmly in my mind. We ended up scraping most of the crema to the sides in order to both find and taste the short rib, which was pretty solid by itself. The beef just gets completely masked if you eat it with the crema. If the crema was a thin drizzle across the top of the fries, with more of the gravy (poutine normally has more gravy) and cheese, these would have been more enjoyable.<br><br>I won't be jumping at the chance to return here, but if a friend really wanted to go I would give it another shot but order different items. They DO have checks next to their \"popular\" menu items, and two of the three items I ordered were not checked. I just felt that everything I ate could have been improved with a slight change to the preparation.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-Z6S5ohBNHjQrAKmwf5Mnw/348s.jpg", "caption": "Kalbi Poutine"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NGA7-bbgpKqNzZa_EJfyWQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Seoul Style Street Dumplings"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qWwkoH568DyAcEImrvn8_A/168s.jpg", "caption": "K-town Chicken Wings"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Love the Korean/Mexican fusion.

I also love their spicy, cold, bibim noodles ( a solid vegetarian option that can be made vegan if you ask for it without the half boiled egg atop). I've also tried the kimchi (appears to be store bough, and you can buy a jar to take home), fries with some sort of aioli (do not recommend), and veggie hot stone bibimbap (substantial, but you have to mix it yourself). <br><br>The food portions are not too big, but the place is very affordable and dinner for two coats under &25 without alcohol.<br><br>The place isn't BYOB, and they serve alcohol.

There are also bipimbops which are rice bowls if u order this be careful its hot asf and if u want it to go ask them to do it for u its hot asf u will burn urself n u can get a bento box which is like grilled meat and rice. There are also soups and other sides just try things n theres usually a special. The ambiance is small and there are no reservations so i would recommend to come early have a friend sit at an empty table order food n boom ur good if the waits supper long go chill out at mollys cupcakes then come back. Service i hated it they are teenagers so not that friendly not really trained good really lazy there was one person here who had an attitude the whole time and another thing learn how to space out dishes like u guys are a restaurant not micky ds act professional. Food: its cheap and the portions are big. Are they the best tacos i ever had not even close best asian food not even close its good but its a cheap place to get good asian tacos. Wish it was open later. Plz make desserts everyone who eats here goes to mollys cupcakes for dessert bet if you made desserts youd take away their customers just a suggestion. also plz make your own tortillas takes two seconds. Change the tacos the pork and the chicken are exactly the same or like everything has the same beef in it so the bimp n bop n ban mi aren't necessary / and plz update menu change things add different things like Nakji-bokkeumi (korean octopus)/ dubakki/Jopchae. Best things: tofu taco/ tofu hot pot/ kalbi poutine/ shrimp taco/ fish taco/ beef bento box <br><br>4/5 Tofu hot pot: it is really good picture like Â a mapo tofu had a baby with a seafood soup there was a lot of seafood Â but its really overcooked. Theres a lot of really silky tofu and there was beef too and it comes with rice wish it came with noodles instead. if u like mapo tofu youll love this only complaint needs more seafood n need more salt n does have consistency issues<br><br>0/5 Yukaejang (beef soup): this was gross. It wasnt flavorful and had no depth was a basic bland beef soup that needed salt n there werent a lot of veggies honestly just after one bite was like ya imma take it home which means into the garbage it will go lol<br><br>6/5 Kalbi poutine $9:99 (ask for a side of sesame chili aioli) best fries i ever had like it was so good wanted to order another one. Theres alot of beef and its really flavorful the fries are crispy with a really tasty spice on them theres a delicious sauce then theres sour cream as a cooling effect then theres pickled onions to cut through the richness i ordered Â aioli for this cause i love mayo with fries (technically on everything ) and it made it taste even better but the lady made a big deal how i had to pay 25 cents in my mind i was like really i ordered the whole menu but her attitude will be talked about later. One complaint is for the price its a tiny portion<br><br>3/5 K town chicken wings $10:50 these were good like they were crispy sauce was good and they were big they had sesame seeds on them but they were really sweet needed some heat or complexity to counteract the sweetness <br><br>0/5 Spicy calamari stir fry $12:50 i didnt like this for one thing not that much calamari. I didnt like the flavor it just tasted kinda like kimchi when i was expecting something else like it wasnt flavorful was disappointed wish it was Nakji-bokkeumi instead <br><br>0/5 Pork and chicken taco they get the same review because its the same thing with a different protein wasnt that flavorful and was tough and dry<br><br>2/5 Bulgogi taco this was ok again it was dry but was better then the pork and chicken taco<br><br>4/5 Fish taco was crispy and not greasy the slaw was so flavorful really was a great taco my issue was the fish needed seasoning<br><br>5/5 shrimp taco amazing supper flavorful crunchy just put more shrimp in<br><br>6/5Blackened tofu taco: this was the best dish of the night it was so flavorful. Alot of people are scared of veggies even more so of tofu but they really add alot of seasoning to the tofu to make it taste really flavorful theres a succotash for texture then a delicious salsa verde really wanted to order another one<br><br>Bento box $13: delish.

It was filled with crispy shrimp in a tangy, spicy sauce - it was an awesome combination. The kalbi was very good too with a great, smoky flavor (lots of meat). The fish was good, but a little more normal, as it tasted more like a normal fried fish taco (but with a huge portion of fish!). The tacos are not very big but are filled with meat/seafood and are a good value for $3/$4 each.<br><br>The reason for the 5 stars are the Chicken Wings. They. Were. So. Good! You get 8 wings for $10.50. They are actually all drumsticks and a decent size (but not huge like Crisp (if you're wondering, I like these wings better than Crisp)). They come on a plate and are absolutely soaked in this delicious soy garlic sauce. It's slightly spicy so be careful! I couldn't stop eating these things!

The Korean red pepper marinade is outstanding and I made sure to get a little chicken, wasabi-onion, spicy cucumber salad and steamed rice in every mouthful. It was sweet, spicy, and divine.<br><br>My favorite was the Spicy Tofu Hotpot with beef, seafood, and tofu in a spicy chili broth. The hotpot was brought out boiling and this dish was savory, spicy, and savory. Yes- two 'savories'. All the seafood was distinctly delicious (mussels, clams, shrimp & oysters), and the egg, onions, and zucchini mixed with the side of rice thickened up nicely.

My mouth is watering as I'm thinking about them. Yum! I highly recommend going here and getting these two tacos. I'd also love to try more of the different tacos!<br><br>I'd skip the kimchi fries. I thought that they were a bit too salty for my taste and nothing really spectacular. The cashier who took my order said that his favorite item on the menu is the chicken wings. I also saw that a lot of people were eating bibimbap. I'll give those a try next time!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nHhL-XMghQxh4_vfbMnxhg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Kalbi taco and shrimp taco"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DTsIb3XvX_KQta3R_HwwlA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Kimchi fries"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "I just went here for the second time just a few days ago, so I gotta give Del Seoul some praise! First of all, I'm amazed by how ~not~ pricey this place is, because you can get a very hearty meal here and not be afraid to look at your bank account afterward. Del Seoul also has a fantastic beer/cider selection, and if you get takeout, they'll package up your lil' drink for you as well -- ALCOHOL ON-THE-GO! Who doesn't want that? If you're a first-timer I'd suggest any of their tacos or a bibimbap bowl, because you'll be full and they do such a fantastic job cooking everything. Also, use the sauce that comes with the bibimbap bowl, you won't be disappointed, folks!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Went here on a whim after moving to the neighborhood and it was good, but not great. I had heard rave reviews so I decided to finally give it a try. I ordered the kalbi poutine and the chicken taco. Taco was delish and loaded with meat! Also love that they serve it on corn tortillas. <br><br>The poutine, however, tasted nothing like what I expected. It looked amazing and parts of it were good but the meat was too sweet and the cheese did not go with the rest of the ingredients in my opinion - too much like sour cream, which I cannot stand. However I do think these are my tastes and it is probably objectively very good! I did enjoy the pieces of the poutine I could eat before the cheese got in the way.<br><br>Service was speedy and they were very nice considering I was on my phone when I ordered. Overall I would definitely come back, but skip the poutine.", "pics": null}}]}
