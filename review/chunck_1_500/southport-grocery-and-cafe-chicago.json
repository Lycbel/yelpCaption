It's cute, but not as much of a \"grocery\" as I expected based on the name. But we were there for breakfast so it's irrelevant. <br><br>Breakfast and lunch are served all day, which is kind of awesome. We ordered a bunch of things between us, including individual pancakes and full dishes. I like that they give an option for an individual pancake, though $4.50-$5.50 seems a bit excessive. That said, it was delicious. I had the cupcake pancake, which happens to be gluten free if that's your thing (it's not mine but it sounded amazing, and it was). The vanilla butter that came with it is epic. I also tried a bit of my friend's hash, which was awesome as well. Our other friend ordered the avocado toast, which contrary to being a millennial, I've never actually seen in-person (though I've made it myself). Holy crap I understand why my generation spends their rent money on it. It looked amazing, and next time I would totally risk my semi-avocado allergy to try it. <br><br>I wouldn't make a special trip here purely because it's an annoying drive from where I live, but I would absolutely come back if my dining companions wanted to.

Now...not so much. I'm not sure if the restaurant went downhill or my tastes have changed. Maybe both.<br><br>I visited here about two months ago for brunch. Our server's \"service\" was abysmal. I haven't encountered a server so obviously rude in a long time. He seemed annoyed by our presence, our orders, and life in general. I knew ahead of time that if I checked in on Yelp, I would get a free cupcake...when I showed him said check-in though he just stared blankly at me. He waited about 5 seconds before saying something like \"I guess I can bring you a cupcake.\" I felt foolish and embarrassed...not emotions you want to feel interacting with a waiter. The cupcake itself wasn't even that good. I had remembered it being amazing, but amazing it was not. It was generic and even dry. <br><br>For brunch I ordered the hash minus the cheese and my dining companion ordered an omelette. Even without the cheese my hash was so incredibly greasy, as well as salty. My friend thought the same about his omelette. Of course I expect restaurant food to be a little more salty and heavy than a homemade brunch, but this was excessive. I think I consumed my sodium intake for the day. Meanwhile the server continued to be curt throughout our meal and even at the end when I was purchasing some jam from the grocery part, I felt like he was glaring at me while ringing me up. Seriously what is up with this dude? Ugh the one star is for my positive memories of this place from a long time ago. Also it's not possible to give 0 stars.

The place was tightly packed and our two combined tables were uneven. Upon sitting, we ordered an \"appetizer\" for the table and put in our orders. The place was out of shareable bread, which was odd, as it is probably the easiest thing to make. Therefore, we settled on the grilled coffee cake as a starter. Unfortunately, the coffee cake did not come to the table for 45 minutes. The other food items probably took another 20 minutes after that. The cake itself was pretty good, the rest of the meal was not much to rave about. I ordered the cuban with a side salad. The bread on the cuban was pretty dry to the point of hurting my gums. The salad was edible. The presentation of the dishes looks good, but the taste was not there. I had difficulty digesting the sandwich for hours. Â Overall, this is a convenient but mediocre place for brunch.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Fuc29fTEr5wJyYP6i9GOfg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Cuban sandwitch with side salad"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cac1dDeNyYkEoejf_ACB6g/168s.jpg", "caption": "Sweet Bread"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Awful. Tried to get breakfast this morning & there were several tables available with a line out the door. No one took our name for 10 minutes while staff stood around without helping. I've been here several times & always found the service rather unaccommodating. How could you not even have a host to seat people on Sunday morning for breakfast? As a 10+ year resident of the area, I'm sad to say this was the last straw with Southport Grocery.

That's not entirely on the staff, as customers who enjoy a place can linger a bit, but would be nicer to have the tables turned a bit more quickly. <br><br>The food was pretty good - the special meat quiche was unconventionally thin (think a piece of thin crust pizza), but the size of the portion was wide/long. Still tasted very good, and the provided hot sauce was a nice touch.<br><br>The salad on the side had no dressing whatsoever, so maybe that was a miss on the kitchen? The elements included in the salad were tasty, however. <br><br>I also ordered a biscuit, and had to ask for jam/butter separately (would think those come with as a default), but it was a tasty & flaky biscuit.<br><br>Had the Bourbon & Bourbon (cider), that was oddly served lukewarm - apparently their drinks refrigerator was on the fritz, so received a cup of ice on the side.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Great service.

A server at the Green Door Tavern recommended it to us. We all ordered Bloody Mary's, which were spicy and delicious.

We had plenty of time, so it wasn't bothersome, but if you're very hungry or in a hurry, this may not be the place. <br><br>I got the breakfast sandwich. Usually chicken sausage is a bit dry, but this was not at all. The sandwich was super flavorful with cheese, arugula, and pepper jam. I requested my egg be medium instead of over-easy, and it came out perfectly. The potatoes that come with it are mashed, which seems a bit different for breakfast, but they were soooo good. Everyone in my group really liked their food. It is maybe a bit more than moderately priced; for a Bloody Mary and the breakfast sandwich, my bill was about $24.

A little pricey, but all ingredients and produce are fresh and local so I am willing to pay for that.

Clark and I ordered carry out this time around and picked up our breakfast sandwiches on our way to watch the Browns finish out their (heartbreaking) season. We couldn't wait the hour+ wait to sit, but we were dying for those homemade English muffins and sausage. <br><br>Clark picked up the food while I grabbed coffee down the street and we snacked on our breakfast inside the Southport Brown Line stop. They didn't include any utensils or napkins, which we seriously needed (the egg is a perfect medium fried egg, so it's still runny, but not overwhelming), so that proved a bit of a challenge. I think we were both so hungry and excited to be eating the food that we didn't care all too much. (I even stuck my bare finger in the red potato mash for a little taste because I just had to.) Even the cheese stayed melty on the sandwich despite Clark's walk from SPG to the Brown Line! I was delighted. <br><br>Would you believe the adult pop tart was easier to eat than the breakfast sandwich? I think it was my favorite one too...blueberries, this time of year. <br><br>I love that SPG continues to provide such fond, funny memories with their delicious and tasty and perfect and yummy and incredible food.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "We came here on a Saturday afternoon in the summer. Around 1pm, there was a wait for the outside section and the inside was wide open, and for good reason, since the AC was broken. I order the breakfast hash and I ask if I can add in spinach. The waiter went to the kitchen to ask and apparently, adding spinach to a dish is not allowed.... Strange but okay, still giving it a shot. The almond milk is an extra $.75 and the vanilla was another $.75 to go with my iced coffee. About 25 minutes so by and we've only gotten our coffees when the waiter asks us how everything is. We have literally no food on the table so this question is impossible to answer. Finally after almost an hour our food comes. My hash is French fries with bacon and an egg in a bowl. Mind you, this \"dish\" is $14. See picture for proof. <br><br>On our way out, the girl at the register is completely soaking wet. I asked her if she was sweating or if she spilled.
