The dish I ordered was the Holy Cow ramen which has chili-infused noodles and spicy beef bone broth, neither of which I've seen before. The menu suggests adding egg and garlic on this one, and I complied. The dish was meaty, funky (in a good way), garlicy, and had a solid spice that builds as you go. I didn't think it was all that spicy upon first slurp but by the end I was a little dewy. <br><br>My wife ordered the Furious bowl, which is a spicy tonkotsu broth that ALSO HAS DUMPLINGS IN IT. I'm 100% on board anytime you can sneak a dumpling into a dish. Everything about this one was good as well... the pork belly was tender, and the marinated mushrooms were really good. <br><br>We also ordered the fried dumplings, which were classic and delicious. The wrappings were nice and crispy but not too heavy. Everything we ate was good, and the ramen was interesting, so we'll definitely put this on our list to repeat.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cFUO-jrxvux2vD3UaNM9jQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "Furious Bowl"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qWQ_Fp26f3xaQClmvkdryQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Holy Cow Ramen"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cGI698QxEnpyMSMd0BwPMA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Fried Dumplings"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "I like ramen and I like 90s hip hop as much as the next guy.

Cleared my sinuses for sure, but it's not deathly spicy (if you are a spicy food fanatic). <br><br>I came here with my friend Saturday evening around 9pm, and I didn't know how ordering worked. You walk through the doors, and you order your food at the register, they give you a number, and you sit anywhere you want. When your food is ready, the workers bring the food to you. The place has a menu that you order from, and then you can choose from an add on list of you want to add more for a few dollars extra per item.<br><br>When my friend and I received our food, we both commented on how much food was in the bowl. They do have big portions. At the tables, the place has napkins, reusable chopsticks, and ladles. However, I can barely use chopsticks, and the ladles weren't picking up the noodles, so we had to ask for forks. Our broth wasn't too oily, and both were creamy and delicious.<br><br>As for the atmosphere, the place is pretty small with wooden communal booths along the left wall. This place is known for how their ramen meets hip-hop, but quite honestly, the music was so fricken loud, I couldn't hear what my friend said during our whole dinner. It was very annoying.

Furious Spoon just happened to be the first! It was 5 pm on a Saturday, which is a little earlier than the usual dinner time. The plus of going early is that there weren't that many people there so no wait and we got the end of the table to ourselves. Plus it gave us some time to walk off dinner before getting dessert (Jeni's!)<br><br>You order your food at a counter when you first walk in. We told them it was our first time there and the guy at the counter was super helpful in explaining the menu. We both ended up getting the furious ramen with corn. <br><br>Breakdown of the ramen: <br><br>Noodles: The noodles were good. They weren't too chewy or doughy or under/overcooked. They are pretty thin so this probably isn't the place for you if you like thicker noodles. <br><br>Broth: The broth was also flavorful and not too heavy or oily. It wasn't super spicy to me but I do have a rather high spice tolerance- so take this with a grain of salt!<br><br>Toppings: <br>The egg was cooked beautifully- super runny yolk and egg whites basically dissolved into the broth as well. The bowl also came with two dumplings which is new to me- I've hardly ever had ramen that also came with dumplings! The marinated mushrooms surprised me as they were kinda sweet which is unexpected. I'm not quite sure I liked that and would much prefer a more savory marinade. I was disappointed by the corn- they were rather tough and hard and not like the sweet corn that I'm used to- would not recommend getting the corn! I was also somewhat disappointed with the meat. We got 2 thin cuts of chashu pork. I'm also used to chashu being super tender and a little fattier, but that was not the case here. <br><br>********************************<br><br>Overall I had a good experience here. They do play hiphop rather loudly, not the typical music of choice for a ramen shop and probably isn't everyone's cup of tea but I actually kind of liked it. Gave the place a nice hip vibe.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UM1O0qvG4tpFwHpeAum98g/348s.jpg", "caption": "Furious ramen"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Went here on a chilly fall day and boy was it exactly what I needed. I got the furious ramen and it was delicious! Just the right amount of kick and the egg complemented it really well. If you don't like spicy food just ask them to go light on the spice I believe they do accommodate. Only complaint is that I had like 3 pieces of pork in my entire bowl. For 15$ I was expecting at least 4 lol. Friend got the holy cow and liked it but also said that the ground beef tasted odd. But then again that's ground beef for ya. <br><br>It's super cozy inside. Came at like 3:30 which is an odd time and it was packed. Got lucky and got two seats.

We were skeptical about dining here and probably should have trusted our gut instinct. En Hakore 2.0 was closed so we resorted to trying Furious Spoon. <br><br>During a Sunday late lunch it was packed. There was only one cook and he had to juggle in house orders as well as carry out all by himself. It felt like we waited a while for our food. The menu strictly serves ramen and rice bowls with sides and toppings. No appetizers or desserts. We settled on Veggie Ramen & Furious Ramen. <br><br>I had the Veggie Ramen and it was the worst broth I've ever had. It had a strange vinegar taste. The bowl was served at room temperature which made it difficult for the noodles to fully cook, leaving the noodles with a lot of bite. The majority of the \"veggies\" were bean sprouts and red & green cabbage with slivers of mushrooms. The strangest Veggie in the bowl was the full sized garlic cloves. I thought it was a mushroom and was taken aback in confusion. They were buttery but very potent and did not complement the broth or other vegetables. The Furious Ramen had better broth but the spice was a throat scratching spice vs a heat spice, not pleasant. Ingredients in this bowl made more sense but once again the soup cooled down very fast. Both of us were on the brink of asking for our bowls to be re heated but we decided the food wasn't worth finishing. <br><br>All in all the blaring hip hop music and cool decor couldn't make up for the poor quality of food.

Had the new \"Holy Cow\" beef ramen recently and like another reviewer below said, I would not recommend. It's a thick beef broth, with ground beef, so it was a bit like eating spicy spaghetti.

It just tastes more like what you'd see at a Chinese noodle shop, which is just a different texture and flavor profile. Also, there are green beans and corn in the ramen, which definitely makes it not taste like ramen, but more like a soup that happens to have noodles in it.<br><br>ATMOSPHERE (3/5): There are speakers on top of every part of the table, while they blast loud music.

I have some food allergies and radish is fine but I just wanted to make sure. I asked one of the staff members to confirm, she responded, \"it's kimchi?\" Nonetheless, it was dry and didn't really have that much flavor. Didin't really care for it. <br><br>The tsukemen here was okay. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. The noodles are served cold-- as it should be-- but the broth was room temperature (should be hot).

The other toppings didn't do much for flavor and the broth didn't have that much flavor either. Eh.

Overall- one of my favorite ramen places ever.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Came here for some dinner on a weekday. Interesting hipster vibe immediately upon walking in. They were blasting some older hardcore hip-hop and gangsta rap throughout the establishment. I enjoy such music, but it seemed a out of place in a ramen bar. Typically I like to eat my ramen in peace and harmony, savoring each and every bite without any aural stimulation as the Japanese do, and I wasn't sure if I necessarily enjoyed the 2Pac or Wu Tang Clan clashing upon my ear drums in that setting.<br><br>Shoyu Ramen - Too salty. Great flavors - but too salty. The egg I ordered as an additional topping was poached with very good technique, but I definitely prefer a flavor infused soft-boiled egg on top of my ramen dishes as the Japanese do instead. The noodles themselves were of great quality and soaked up the salty soup quite well, making for some delicious and flavorful noodles. There were also bean sprouts included in this dish, which is not a usual ramen topping for me - I somehow don't think that I've ever had bean sprouts on ramen before, and thus wasn't sure how I felt about them. And the nori on top was shredded whereas I'm more used to the paper kind. These seemingly small deviations from what I consider the \"norm\" for a bowl of ramen contributed to the more hipster vibe I felt eating here. Although I personally didn't enjoy these differences - perhaps I'm a little too conservative when it comes to my ramen, I thought that they all could have worked well together if I had perhaps been in a more exciting and adventurous mood. Then maybe I'd have found their take on this dish more welcoming.<br><br>Tsukemen Ramen - My friend ordered this. The noodles had a much smaller caliber than I'm accustomed to with tsukemen, and they had a lot less broth than expected as well. They included some limes with their noodles, which is definitely not as the Japanese do. (My friend said they do give you limes at this one reputable tsukmen place in LA, but I've never seen the combination before). However, this dish was incredibly delicious! I LOVED the lime, and the \"Fresno\" chilis were an interesting and exciting addition to the dish as well. The broth was very flavorful, as is required for a proper tsukemen dish, and although it wasn't as much as I'm used to having with tsukemen, it was sufficient for my friend, who didn't need all of it to finish off all of the noodles.<br><br>A couple of other comments - the pork in both our ramens was good, not great or wild or anything, just good. My friend also got some of their fury sauce that we both sampled. We both liked it, but didn't really touch it after trying it for a couple of bites. The apple flavor was just a bit too strange for me, and I felt like it didn't really go well with my noodles. My friend also got some kimchi on the side, which turned out to be AMAZING! Really a random hit. I typically hate cabbage but each piece was dripping with so much flavor, I found myself regularly taking pieces of it, not as the Japanese do but probably as the Koreans do, from my friends stash during the entire meal - probably much more than I was entitled to (sorry my dear friend, if you're reading this, I know you thoroughly enjoyed that kimchi as well and were too polite to say anything to stop me from eating it all after you said I could try it).<br><br>Overall an extremely interesting place to eat some ramen. I was not expecting the typical bowl of ramen after reading a couple of reviews prior to coming here, but this place still intrigued the heck out of me. Almost all aspects of our meals were interesting to me, even if they didn't necessarily work out in the end. Ranging from slightly different alterations to classic dishes, to some truly creative culinary choices, I have to say I really enjoyed my experience here. I recommend coming here for a gangsta-fusioned-hipster version of your favorite Japanese noodle dish - just remember to leave all your expectations of a typical Japanese ramen house behind before entering!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xLEfD99IXZ5JT6N-cAC4sA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Tsukemen ramen - never had dish with lime and chilis before.

When we came (around 5:30 on a Friday) it wasn't too crowded, but I can imagine that it becomes much more difficult to get a seat in an hour or two. <br><br>Speed: came quickly - we got the citrus and shoyu ramen.<br><br>Taste: definitely fusion. This isn't where you would go for authentic Japanese ramen (which, if this is what you're looking for, go a block or two on Milwaukee to Kizuki Ramen). The broth is pretty heavy and concentrated in both (more so in the shoyu). I think the citrus ramen is an interesting take on a traditionally umami-heavy food. I personally liked the thin noodles but I have heard some people not being fans because they're not as chewy.<br><br>Portions: decent, it filled me up just enough so that I wasn't hungry anymore. I'm used to slightly bigger portions at other ramen establishments but clearly the concentrated broth is the focus at Furious Spoon.<br><br>Music: I don't usually talk about this because I'm not as much of an ambience person, but the music was LOUD when we were there. The bass was really heavy, and the playlist consisted entirely of hard core rap. Not my preference, but really wouldn't have been a problem if only the music wasn't SO loud.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0M1J3pSViYmFcGL1PgZy6w/168s.jpg", "caption": "Shoyu on top, citrus ramen on the bottom"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "I should probably preface this by saying I'm not a huge soup fan.

And mediocre is what I got. I met my friend here for dinner last weekend and it was surprisingly not full considering how crazy Milwaukee Avenue was buzzin'. <br><br>I probably should have just ordered the signature Furious Ramen, but the Citrus Chicken Shio caught my eye. Kinda annoyed that any of the recommended toppings cost extra, but whatevs. I get it. I got the roasted garlic. <br><br>We sat down with our beers and the food came out rather quickly, within 10 minutes. All in all, the ramen was just okay. Nothing special really. Maybe it was this specific dish, and the fact that I didn't get the fury sauce...but the dish was rather bland. I will give them the noodles were cooked nicely.<br><br>The type of music was fine. For the Wicker Park crowd, I find it suiting, but it was probably a tad too loud. I'm just not a fan of yelling in conversation. Customer service was okay. Pretty minimal as you order and then they bring your food to you, then pick up your plates, so not much interaction. <br><br>I'm open to trying this place again and I'll try something different.

I wasn't expecting much since I have heard of Â many mixed reviews about this place. This place is always pretty crowded, especially when it gets later in the evening so I wouldn't recommend bringing a huge party with you. At Furious Spoon, you place your order first and then bring a number with you as you seat yourself in any of the available seats in the restaurant. The seating arrangements are communal so prepare to get close with strangers. I came with a group of around seven people and we had to split into two groups in order to all be seated.<br><br>I ordered the Shoyu Ramen and all of my friends ordered the Furious Ramen. I also added an egg and corn to my bowl (you have to pay for additional ingredients). I would say that the noodles really stood out to me--they were perfectly cooked and remained wonderfully chewy even after sitting in the broth for some time. The egg addition is a must since the explosion of yolk of the soft-boiled egg was a welcoming taste to the broth. If you are worried that the Furious Ramen will be too spicy, don't. I tried some of my friends' orders and the broth was not the least bit spicy. The broth for the Furious Ramen was more sour than the thick broth of the Shoyu Ramen and there seemed to be hints of citrus (?) in it.<br><br>Furious Spoon is ultimately a place to get ramen. Unlike other restaurants that offer other small side dishes and appetizers, Furious Spoon doesn't really have a large selection of anything else besides ramen. The ramen I ordered was tasty and the 25% discount I received by signing up for their mailing list made it even better.

My friend and I wer looking for a late night spot to grab a bite to eat after a concert, and piece pizza was reserved for a private party and small cheval was closing in five minutes.

Furious spoon was open late, close by, and serving warm food on a cold night so I was finally inside my first ramen joint. They recommended me to try the furious ramen and even though I don't really like spicy, I for some reason LOVED this ramen. The poached egg didn't drip into the bowl and it wasnt Instagram worthy, but I'm all about the taste. And the taste was amazing. It was not just amazing. It was amazeballs. Every single bite was an explosion of different flavors on your tongue. It was insane. My nose was running a bit but I didn't care. The spices were sweet and not overpowering. The chicken was so juicy and the beef was easy to eat in the soup. The mushrooms were delicious and the noodles were plentiful and yummy. I loved their furious rice bowl as well.
