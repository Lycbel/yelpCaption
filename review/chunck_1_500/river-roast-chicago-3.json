We had a party of 6 and went with the whole chicken and the 24 ounce rack of pork.<br><br>For starters, a dozen oysters is a great choice. We went with 6 east coast and 6 west coast. Normally, I'd always say that the west coast is the best coast, but on this particular occasion, I preferred the east coast oysters. While they were smaller, I liked that they had more of a buttery flavor to them and didn't taste like the ocean.<br><br>We also shared the burrata and the shrimp and crab toast. The burrata comes with slices of candied quince on top, pomegranate seeds, pepitas and a small side of arugula. It was light and refreshing with a touch of sweetness from the quince. The shrimp and crab toast was a crab salad with a dollop of mashed avocado on top of a slice of crispy brioche.<br><br>The roasted chicken was easily the standout dish. It was semi carved tableside for us (they removed the wings, thighs and cut some of the breast before placing on it on the table). The chicken was incredibly moist, juicy and seasoned well. Every cut of meat had great flavor and moistness. The skin was golden brown, light, crispy and not oily.<br><br>The rack of pork was a bit of a letdown. It's a Berkshire pork and some of the pieces were really dry. The best was the belly, but there weren't many pieces to go around. The belly was flavorful, crispy and extra fatty. Every other cut was pretty dry and needed a liberal application of the sauce (amazing) to make them palatable.<br><br>The sides we got were a bit of a disappointment as well. I didn't like that the cauliflower had a curry sauce on the bottom of it. The cauliflower was a bit soggy and the curry was not a good combination. The brussels sprouts were also on the soggier side. It would've been better if they had leafed all the sprouts and then roasted them to make them crispy.<br><br>Service was excellent. Our server was energetic, informative and extremely helpful. We informed him we were celebrating 2 birthdays and an engagement, and he provided us with complementary ice cream and a giant slice of one of the most decadent and rich chocolate cakes I've ever had. He even took multiple pictures for us to commemorate the meal.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Visiting from out of town- made a reservation, was able to sit outside on this beautiful afternoon.

Writing a bad review means you've had a poor experience unless you're the kind of menacing bastard that takes enjoyment from putting people down. Sometimes it doesn't matter how badly you want to enjoy something and be positive - it's simply that bad. <br><br>My friend, sister and I were looking for a place in River North to have lunch that had a nice view of the river itself. After a quick Yelp search we stumbled upon River Roast, which seemed to boast everything we needed and was only a few blocks from where we were standing. We walked into the restaurant entrance to find that we had to go down some stairs to actually get to the dining room. This place is HUGE. It would be a great place for large groups and special occasions. We weren't able to sit outside but we did score a table right next to the window so we could enjoy the view and air conditioning.<br><br>Their menu had a lot of different options that sounded good but nothing jumped out at me. My friend ordered the mushroom toast with brussels sprouts, my sister had the burger with the potatoes, and I did the sandwich of the day (Italian beef with lemon aioli) and a side of creamed spinach. All their burger also come with a side of house-made BBQ kettle chips.<br><br>My friend thoroughly enjoyed her food. They did charge her $3 to add goat cheese to her toast which I thought was a major rip-off. I wasn't a big fan of her sprouts either, but she liked them so to each their own. My sister ate her burger but she mentioned she was famished. She said it wasn't the worst burger she's had and it tasted just fine. Her potatoes were bomb though. She became full because she loved the chips and I finished off her potatoes. My food, however, was extremely disappointing. Chicago is known for Italian beef and I was intrigued by the idea of getting an upscale version. It was probably one of the driest sandwiches I've ever had. There was no flavor to the beef, and the giardiniera that topped it was working extra hard to save something that couldn't be saved. It took forever to flag down my server for extra lemon aioli, but even dunking the sandwich in the aioli couldn't resuscitate the thing. I ended up leaving 3/4 of it on the plate. The creamed spinach ultimately ended up being my meal because I wasn't impressed by chips either. You can only eat so much creamed spinach before tiring of the texture, but I ate enough of it to be sad-full.<br><br>We had a server but she was very hard to find. She took 10 minutes just to greet us, and once we had our food she was nowhere to be found until we were ready for our checks. I'm usually pretty forgiving if one part of my meal is sub par. If our server had been around more often to ask how my meal was, I probably could have squashed my concerns right then and there. Unfortunately I was never asked how my meal was and I was never checked on to see if everything's okay. I begrudgingly forked over $80 for two meals, one of which I barely touched.<br><br>I always try to at least give places 3 stars and find the positive in things. I try to be fair because I know people don't (usually) purposely screw up things. But sometimes, there's just no positives to report. This was one of those times.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YV8HpXn0VZMkJiuYV-AELQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "Sandwich of the day, kettle chips, Coleslaw and creamed spinach"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Had a lovely event at the River Roast tonight.

As soon as we got there, the staff seemed excited to serve us. The server heard me mention mimosas and within minutes I had one in hand. For the meal, we split dishes because we weren't sure what to get. First, we had the chilaquiles....and wow. They were absolutely incredible. We were fighting over the last bite. Then, we split the special omelette. The omelette itself was just good, but the potatoes that came on the side were worthy of all the hype. They were perfectly crisped and seasoned. Finally, we split the hash. The meat in the hash was so flavorful, but this dish was not my favorite. It was pretty hard to rival the chilaquiles, if I'm being honest. <br><br>For dessert, we split the MASSIVE chocolate cake. We were shocked by how big it was when it made its arrival to our table. There were audible gasps from tables nearby. Alas, we cleaned the plate. Good chocolate cake is hard to resist. <br><br>We loved our experience at River Roast.

We asked if by chance they could accommodate 2 for dinner without reservations and he said of course we can.<br><br>Our servers name was Oscar and OMG he was fantastic. He was quick and attentive but not annoying. I ordered Chardonnay and my husband got some gin drink which he said was good.<br><br>For dinner ordered the 16oz prime rib and sweet corn. The server asked about an appetizer but all I wanted was bread and butter which wasn't on the menu. He went above and beyond and brought us four slices of slightly toasted bread and butter. It was a very in's gesture. <br><br>The prime rib is served table side from a large portable buffet like station. It's medium rare (server told us this before we ordered it) but that's how we prefer it. The prime rib itself was tasty and more then enough for two of us to share. It was soft but a little hard to cut only because the knives needed sharpening for sure. I hate fat and it did come with a lot of fat but I was easily able to cut it off. Only negative comment I had about the prime rib was that it could have been warmer. It wasn't cold but it also wasn't hot either, it was luke warm as best. We told the server after we ate it and he was horrified that he didn't tell him before. We told him it wasn't a huge deal especially because we still ate all of it. We did recommend they should consider serving it on hot plate. <br><br>The sweet corn was the winner of the whole meal. It's Mexican stupid corn and oh so good. It's sweet, spicy and creamy. It comes out extremely hot so if helped with the warm up the prime rib.<br><br>They also accidentally brought us the whipped sweet potato. They gave it to us free of charge. They were a little more runny than what I'd prefer but other than that good. They had a very creamy and sweet flavor profile. <br><br>We ended the night with a chocolate cake because it was our anniversary. It was HUGE.

They are located on LaSalle and the River. Valet parking is available, but walking is much nicer. <br><br>The menu is best for sharing family style. You can choose two or three roasted meats, several sides, and drinks to share. They offer several punch bowls for large groups which is fun. The food is smaller than expected so definitely order more than you think you can eat. <br><br>We had a large group of 8 and destroyed a prime rib, whole chicken, whole fish, and some pork roast. The fish was the best served with fresh pork rinds. Unfortunately the chicken and beef were just average, and the pork was a bit too fatty for my taste. <br><br>The sides were really good. The creamed spinach was very good and popular. The fresh corn was served elote style and was also tasty. We had some fresh baked bread with a fried onion butter which was a nice touch. Some of the meats come with sides too, but not enough for everyone. <br><br>Service was spotty, but the staff managed to help out with elderly guests and a birthday cake slice.

Â River Roast has 2 floors with both restaurant and bar spaces, but also some HUGE private event and reception areas, and a nice (though not terribly large) outdoor deck overlooking the river.<br><br>That said, this restaurant doesn't live up to the amazing potential it has. Â For starters, it was nearly empty the entire time we were here, which is a shame as it really is a nice venue. Â We arrived for lunch and were told they only offered a very limited happy hour menu that late in the afternoon, with only a few food and drink options listed.

First, I loved the riverfront view and the southern style decor. Very comfortable ambience. The food really was great. We had the golden gobbets for an appetizer, which were good just could have used some salt. The chopped salad was great too. The entrees really were 5 stars though. Extremely good. We had the whole fish which literally melted in your mouth, and the roast beef which with the sauce they give you is top notch. I would go back just to eat those two things again! The key lime pie for dinner was ok, but I saw some carrot cakes go by that looked pretty good. Overall, I would recommend this place for a nice dinner on the river.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Skip this place until there's new management<br><br>We live in Chicago & this is our 3rd visit to River Roast, although we haven't been here in over 2 years. Â Things have taken a drastic turn for the worst. Â First it took over Â 1/2 hour before the cocktails were brought to the table. Â This only happened after telling 2 servers and the manager than something was wrong. Â Upon arrival of the drinks, the entrees followed 3 minutes later. Â The manager was certainly apologetic & did \"comp\" the drinks. Â The food was tasty, but arrived cold. Â They took the potatoes back to be reheated and they were returned 10 minutes later. Â When we finally got the check, they charged us for an extra order of potatoes. Â They saw their error & removed the charge from our bill. How do you spell disaster?<br>Something here is definitely wrong and I'd suggest that you skip this place. Â Our city has many great restaurants that know the importance of good management.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I went there last weekend for a quick bite with friends before the Beyonce concert.
