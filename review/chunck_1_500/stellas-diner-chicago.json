We went here for Sunday brunch and were seated shortly after we reached the place.

I ordered an omelet and it was lackluster, having not being seasoned at all.

More than likely you will leave food on the table or take leftovers.<br><br>The coffee was decent. It was not gourmet or something to rave about. They have a $3 per person fee for the booth if you don't order food in case you are one of those want to sit and wait for hours in a booth and sip unlimited refills of coffee. I swore that only happened in the movies, but if it's a fee added to their menu well I guess it happens more often than it seems. <br><br>They use fresh ingredients! My food took a while to come out but it was worth it. I could tell it was made with fresh eggs and meat instead of something out of a can. <br><br>Street parking is available but start looking for it early. This extremely busy area is known for having limited parking and lots of traffic! <br><br>Excellent service - The busboys, waiters, and waitresses understand good service and work to continuously provide it. From the friendly greeting down to quickly removing used dishes from our table to being prompt in offering refills on coffee and water, this place understands how to be attentive without clingy. <br><br>:) Our waitress had the flare! She wore this gold metallic eyeliner and was full of energy. It was one of those things where it's a small detail that makes you smile and is hard to forget for no reason at all.<br><br>The bathrooms were very clean which is a huge plus but beware they only had two in the whole place and they get kind of busy so there maybe a line.<br><br>Cons - <br><br>No parking lot. Most diners at least have a small parking lot, but I'm guessing in Chicago those are hard to come by. <br><br>:) No other con's it was nice.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "They serve delicious diner food with a friendly, family vibe.

I had heard good things about Stella's, so I dropped in after a lazing around in bed all morning, around 11 am. There was a wait, but only 5-10 minutes. Since I was going solo, I bypassed the line and sat at the counter. <br><br>I read a lot of reviews about the friendliness of the servers. However, the lady setting me up with coffee and getting my spot set up seemed a little grumpy and didn't get me a place setting, a menu, or any fixings for the coffee.

But they were good, as hash browns tend to be.<br><br>Overall this place is decent, I just don't really get the hype. Not just in Yelp reviews; I have friends who love this place.

The menu and food is simple at a very affordable price. I ordered a Bleu Cheese and Bacon burger with fries and a vanilla shake. The burger was average and a little dry and I wish the shake was a little thicker. The fries were hot and crispy.

The Corned Beef Hash was a little on the salty side and the hash browns were a little on the bland side. The Eggs and hash browns really benefitted from the hot sauce and ketchup combo. The Hungry Person Skillet was filling and well seasoned as well! The Diva cake was like a less runny lava cake with a layer of fudge and topped with vanilla ice cream.

A gentleman (not my server) brought me water immediately and asked about other drinks. I got a coffee, and throughout my visit, neither my water or coffee hit within two inches of the bottom of the glass without someone asking about a refill, whether it was my friendly server or one of the other folks helping out. A++.<br><br>I have a habit at breakfast places of maximizing my dollar in terms of variety, so after a thorough examination of the menu, settled on the Country Style Eggs Benedict.

From what I could see, this was the best value on the menu.<br><br>The food came out in about 5 minutes, super fast! Up till now, this was a solid 4 star experience... Then I tried the food, and WOW! I don't really even like ham, but this was truly delectable, very moist and tender, cuttable with just my fork, and with excellent flavor. I truly don't know if I've had better ham. And they didn't skimp on how much ham was on the plate.<br><br>The gravy, hash browns, and eggs were solid, but the biscuits!! The biscuits were perfectly fluffy, stopping just short of crumbling apart on their own...I didn't know it was possible to strike such a balance, it was just damn good. <br><br>The best part about this meal was that it wasn't over-salted like you'll find at many diners, it was just great. I ate half the meal, then thought \"Let me try this with some ketchup!\" I ruined that bite, and went back to eating the rest as it was meant to be enjoyed, sans anything extra.<br><br>When I finished what was on my plate, two gentleman asked simultaneously from different directions if I was done. Talk about service. All in all, I was in and out in a little over a half hour, and now this place is on my radar, which I'm ever grateful for. Best diner I've been to.<br><br>They do have room for groups of 6 comfortably, but you might have to wait.
