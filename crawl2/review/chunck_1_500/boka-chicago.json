Each dish incorporates different textures and flavor profiles that work harmoniously to keep your palate happy.<br><br>To whet your palate, the meal starts off with amuse bouche that features 3 items. My favorite was the oysters. They're fresh, sweet, and buttery. They're also topped with a creamy sauce.<br><br>The crudo dish is a great way to dive into the meal. The fish is thinly sliced, marinated and extremely fresh and tender. There's some puffed buckwheat for some crunch with each bite,<br><br>The grated foie gras is very interesting. Instead of the traditional presentation, the foie gras is finely grated to resemble cheese flakes. It's retains all the things you love about foie gras in its natural state. It sits on a bed of diced candied quince and almonds and topped with black truffle dust.<br><br>The mushroom risotto was okay. The risotto was a bit crunchy for me, as I prefer my risotto to have a softer mouthfeel.<br><br>The scallop and lobster soup is very rich and hearty. There's also some uni cream hidden at the bottom for even more decadence. The scallops and lobster are cooked well.<br><br>The 2 main dishes feature quail and venison. For the quail, you get a thigh that's been seared and grilled to perfection. The marinade is a soy/teriyaki preparation and there's also a mushroom puree. The venison is very rich and fatty, and cooked to a medium rare. It's tender throughout and surrounded with a nice crust. There's also a small venison sausage and a celery root puree.<br><br>Of the 2 desserts, the diced pears and ice cream was definitely better than the toffee cake with burn cinnamon. The pears were light and refreshing and a great palate cleanser.<br><br>Service was excellent. All the servers are friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu. They provided assistance as needed when you have questions about what it is you're eating.

Plum was a nice contrast.  He liked it but didn't love it.<br>Grilled beet salad -  I enjoyed the beets but nothing else was noteworthy.<br>Dry Aged Beef Tartare - I tasted more carrots than beef. Not memorable. <br>Grilled Spanish octopus - This is a favorite of mine and I always order it when I see it.   If there is such a thing as over tenderized then their version is it.  Texture was missing as it was more mushy than anything.<br><br>Entrees:<br>Alba White Truffle Tagliolini - I was so excited to try this because I love truffles.  Perfectly al dente tagliolini with a generous amount of crispy shaved truffles in a light cream sauce.  It wasn't heavy but it was extremely salty to the point where it just wasn't enjoyable.  <br>Roasted Beef Short rib - Melted in my mouth; extremely tender but overall salty.<br>Brown Butter Roasted Wild Bass - My absolute favorite dish of the night.  The charred cucumber and sauce was refreshing & vibrant.  It perfectly complimented the delicious fish.  Excellent.<br>Roasted Dry Aged Duck (for one) - Beautiful crispy skin but cooked med rare which resulted in a gamy flavor that he didn't enjoy.  I passed on tasting this.<br><br>We finished off the night with the dark chocolate dessert  - Gelato with a caramel chocolate concoction.  I appreciated the inscription on the plate, nice touch.<br><br>Plating was nicely done.  Portions aren't expected to be large and yet I didn't feel they were skimpy given the caliber of the restaurant.  We tasted a lot of dishes.  At the end of the night, we were the only ones in the dining room.  Maybe the kitchen was tired and ready to go home because we felt most of our food was overly salted with more attention to plating than preparation (with the exception of the Bass).  We were left surprisingly underwhelmed for a Michelin star restaurant. <br><br>I will say the experience, service and atmosphere was worth the visit and we didn't leave hungry.   Boka will always have a special place in my heart.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KR58K-NqRv1l679kCUNDMg/348s.jpg", "caption": "Autumn 2018 Menu"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zIPmzT0JoF8PnKga0d9doA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Exterior"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QyvfFO6Bjj5zFOAoT6XZ1g/168s.jpg", "caption": "Dark Chocolate dessert"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Tremendous meal all around. Really treat you well on service and food. Begins with complimentary bread and amuse bouche of potato. Food is little expensive but none more than any other American restaurant with the lounge/dark lighting atmosphere at Boka. Quality is well worth the price. Most entrees range between $30-40 and looked to come out on the small side most of the time so an appetizer would be recommended. <br><br>We had the ricotta gnocchi, and the chicken and bass for entrees. Gnocchi was fantastic. Had a soft middle that just oozes out. Dish was perfect for dipping and had a full cheese taste and smell with each bite which perfectly began the mea. The bass was tiny but cooked perfectly throughout. Each piece fell off and was perfectly pickable. Sauce again was fantastic, but caught me off guard as the fish itself was very bland so the dish had a deconstructed fee that made it open to the combination eating style. The chicken was some of the best I've ever had. Really strong innards and the thickest skin I've ever had. Had a duck-like crunch of skin that I've never seen on a chicken. Really nice dish and bigger than all other entrees. <br><br>As we came for a birthday celebration, we were offered a complimentary chocolate cake. We also had to order the notorious hazelnut dessert on top. Chocolate cake was good but very typical with layered frosting. The hazelnut dessert was superb. Could have used a little more crunch or a short bread of sorts, but so unique and interesting texture and flavor with 4-5 different aspects to the plate. We then luckily got a banana bread to go from the table next to us that didn't want it - so good and wet and cutely packaged. <br><br>Boka is well deserved of a Michelin star. Well deserved of it's reputation in the city as a quality and consistent meal for business or celebrations. Price is fine and wines available at every price point. Boka group once again delivers a top notch dining experience.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Had our second meal here last night, and it was fantastic. Such a great atmosphere and laid back dining experience. If you're a fan of duck, I highly recommend the roast duck! It was cooked to perfection, medium rare in the inside and oh so crispy on the outside. The confit that accompanied the dish was also rather amazing. <br><br>One of the things I really appreciate about Boka is that when you order a cocktail, the drinks always come out fast. We've been to some other restaurants in the area that take foreverrrrrrr just to get a drink. Dinner is always spaced out well where you don't feel like it's taking too long, or that you are being rushed.

Most likely the best meal I've ever had in Chicago. <br><br>I initially came to this restaurant expecting pretty good food but not so good that I was leaving the restaurant thinking that I just had the best meal I've ever had- but Boka exceeded my expectations. <br><br>As soon as we were seated, we were asked if we were celebrating anything anything special. We told our waiter that we were celebrating our anniversary. Soon after, we were given two glasses of complimentary champagne. I'm not a big drinker but it was a nice gesture and started off our meal on a good note.<br><br>We ordered the mushroom pasta and octopus to start off our meal. As soon as I took my first bite, I turned to my boyfriend and told him that this was the best pasta I've ever had- the sauce was extremely silky with the perfect balance of earthy tones from the mushrooms and nuttiness from the cream/cheese; the small crumbles of chicken skin added a great textural element; the noodles were light and perfectly coated in the sauce.<br>The octopus was excellent- there were some grapes on the dish that added a nice sweetness, the cauliflower added great crunch, and the aioli helped balance the fishy taste of the octopus.<br><br>In addition to our appetizers, we were served the most amazing wheat sourdough bread- which was super super soft and an onion roll that was a melt-in-your-mouth punch of flavors. They also served a tempura bite that had interesting sweet notes from the sauce and crunchiness from the tempura coating. <br><br>For our mains, we ordered the olive oil poached cod and the short ribs. The cod was the softest, most perfectly cooked fish I've ever had! there was some nutty sauce on the plate that was so delicious I wanted to lick the rest of the sauce off the plate! It was also served with some charred lettuce that added a great smokey flavor to the dish. The short ribs were extremely tender and tasted really great with the charred broccolini.<br><br>For dessert, we had the hazelnut dish which came with toasted ice cream- extremely delicious. The sweetness of the hazelnut mouse (?) was perfectly balanced with the ice cream. I really loved the different textures/temperatures on the dish. <br><br>Overall, an amazing experience. I've been to Parachute before which is also on the michelin guide but I think I liked Boka is 10x better than Parachute!

This was easily one of the BEST meals I've had in Chicago. The use of seasonal ingredients and flavor pairings in combination with the impeccable service speaks volumes.<br><br>One of my good friends was having his going away dinner there, and he has met Lee Wolen a few times, so Lee was nice enough to send out a few complimentary dishes from the kitchen in addition to what we ordered. The server told us the menu is intended to be one cold, one hot, and one entree per person, but I think I could have easily skipped one of the courses. The food was more filling than I expected. I ordered the heirloom tomato, ricotta dumplings, and brown butter bass. We were also treated to some sort of egg and basil oil goodness, marinated cucumbers, a beet dish (the only thing I didn't love), and this duck confit and pate sausage stew with honey crisp apples that transported me to swinging in a hammock in the French countryside.<br><br>Every dish had elevated flavors, even what sounded seemingly simple was excellent. The beet dish was the only thing that I felt wasn't executed perfectly - as someone of Ukrainian/Soviet descent, I take my beets pretty seriously. The flavors were great, but the beet was cut too thick and had a little too much crunch/rawness to it.

It was a delicious bite to start the meal (although a bit hot). The bread course was also amazing (I had a second order) - the sourdough is good, but the buttermilk sage rolls are next level. I could eat 10 of these. Served with butter topped with sea salt and fennel pollen. Yum.<br><br>I started the meal with a special white alba truffle tagliolini. This was soo good, so rich, so delicious. Every piece of it was great - pasta was cooked perfectly, the sauce was creamy and delicious, and there was a huge portion of white truffle shaved on top. A steal at $40 I would order this every time I could. <br><br>For my main, I had the whole roasted dry aged duck. This again, amazing. The duck breast was perfectly cooked and juicy, and the skin was crispy and delicious. The foie gras sausage was also very good. Other elements on the plate - a puree that complimented the duck well, and roasted grapes that added an acidic and sweet note to the plate. The side of duck confit was almost overkill - super rich and creamy, but nonetheless I left none of it. <br><br>I didn't have room for dessert this time around, but the two little bites at the end were a great finish to the meal (spiced almond cake & dark chocolate truffle).", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This place is really a culinary masterpiece.  Lincoln Park has some of the best food in the world (Alinea too!).

Boka was the same story. Going into it I assumed it would be a bit scene-y, nothing memorable, and just a typical expensive Chicago joint. I was wrong (again), and this place was top notch. <br><br>Breaking this down by each area of the experience.. starting with service.. From the moment we walked in, the hostess was the nicest and most flexible human we could have dealt with on a busy Saturday night. Then we had a crew of a couple waiters/waitresses helping throughout the meal. Our main guy had a warm, friendly, and welcoming personality. He did well to gauge my mom and I's vibe and play to it. He had beer recommendations, timed the dishes well, and knew when to add conversation or hang back. Kudos to you, man. I wish I remember your name. <br><br>We did the 9 course tasting. But among that we had three non-listed courses so it ended up being 12. And the small selection of beer they had was really unique and impressive! (cocktails were good too, I tried the old fashion rendition they make). Another side note was that they had bread, with more upon request. It was nice to have for a tasting, I feel like tastings leave bread out at times, and I need those filler carbs!<br><br>Here are some highlights. The duck was unreal, so was the prime rib.  They both were large enough to actually eat more than two bites, and had the ideal amount of sauces on the plate to get an amazing bite each time. I would go back just to get either. One of the non-listed items was tempura asparagus and some tortilla chip+fish. Those were super good. Of the other fish we received, the raw tuna was the winner. The other were fine, but not a big highlight. A couple other creative egg/foam/gelo-like dishes came out that we enjoyed as well. <br><br>Dessert was interesting. I loved the mini ice cream on top of granola. But even better were the non-listed truffles, caramels, and banana bread. It capped off a great meal. Then I went home and ate more of the pre-wrapped banana bread you get to go. <br><br>I loved this place. The tasting was worth it too. I'd likely go al-la-carte next time, but the important part is that I WILL be back. More of the high end / Michelon star spots I go once and call it a day.

And it was one of the best items of the night. Amazing meld of flavors and the smoked onion yogurt and cured egg yolk really worked well into the dish. <br><br>Next, was the marinated cucumbers, which presented themselves as a very nice change of flavor from the beef. Intermittently, the server would bring small tasting items that we hadn't ordered, which were really a nice surprise.<br><br>My husband and I shared our entrees: Brown Butter Roasted Bass and the Roasted Chicken. The chicken was delicious, but the real highlight of the night was the bass.

And little did I know, for my birthday, they brought out an additional piece of cake with a nice birthday message on it. Amazing!

My fiance is an adventurous eater so I figured he'd love the tasting menu while I picked an assortment of stuff a la carte, much like our wonderful experience at MK 3 years ago.<br><br>After grabbing a few drinks at the Willow Room that's kiddy corner to Boka, we headed to our Saturday night 7pm reservation. When we arrived, we were ushered to the dining area in front near the bar which was super loud and had a crowd of people standing around.....not what I had in mind for an expensive dinner experience at a Michelin star restaurant.  We did think about asking for a different table, but not knowing what the rest of the restaurant was like, my fiance made the valid point that it's not a guarantee that the next table would be better.   <br><br>Our waitress showed up and started explaining how the menu works- smaller plates, typically order one item from each of the 3 categories.  That's when disappointment #2 happened, they refused to allow my fiance to order the tasting menu unless I got it as well..... so we didn't end up getting it even though he was really looking forward to it.  It just didn't make sense for us to get it because he loves seafood and trying different foods while I don't eat seafood at all and am picky in general. I understand it would have been a slight timing issue, but I wish they would have specified this somewhere online ahead of time or when they call to confirm the reservation.  <br><br>First the cold appetizers: I ordered two slices of tomato for $14.  It was like a decomposed caprese but instead of balsamic they had a plum vinaigrette/sauce that hugely lacked some much needed acidity. It also had pine nuts on it, which I learned that I do not like and could not get the flavor out of my mouth the whole night. My fiancé ordered the beef tartar which was flavorful and well seasoned.  I had a small piece and liked it much better than my appetizer.<br><br>Second the hot appetizers: I had the corn tortelli. Super delicate, but half way through it started tasting like a stick of butter.  My fiancé had the octopus and was disappointed because it lacked in flavor and meatiness. <br><br>Entree: I ordered the beef short rib, what came out more of like medium cooked steak cuts.  It was super smokey, I was just expecting something much more tender and fall off the bone rather than steak like.  I enjoyed the beet that was on the plate; however, thought the gem lettuce to be bit too bitter for my taste.  My fiancé had the scallops. He thought they were bland, lacked a good sear, and the sauce they came in tasted like ranch dressing which wasn't a good pairing with the scallops.<br><br>Dessert: we had the dark milk chocolate dessert, good flavor interesting texture, almost gel like.  I may be wrong, but I tasted a bit of orange peel in the chocolate, very yummy!  As well as the blackberry dessert with sesame.  The desserts were the highlight of the meal, great flavor and pretty memorable.<br><br>In all, both my fiance and I were disappointed.  It's not often we go to such acclaimed and recognized restaurants and spend this much on a meal.  Service was good, but I thought both the ambiance and food did not justify the price that is charged and for that reason I would not go back or recommend it.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JfvkOF5baKL6ZyiYtbKEZQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "Bread"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8Zr-Nb9MdFXbcCr3La58Kg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Beef tartar"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TEiAuCsSTxlNJa9-R8J-MA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Octopus"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "This is the best dining experience I've ever had.

It's restaurants like this that validate my decree proclaiming Chicago's dining scene has no rivals. <br><br>I finally got around to visiting BOKA on a weeknight. I had a reservation and - after arriving several minutes early - I was quickly seated in the stunning dining room with the famed moss-covered wall. Upon entry into the dining room, I was enthralled with the overall aesthetic of BOKA. Very modern, completely unique, and absolutely luxe in every manner. Characteristics that coincide with the dishes Executive Chef Lee Wolen and Executive Pastry Chef Meg Galus send from their kitchen. <br><br>After perusing the current offerings and contemplating whether or not I wanted to bother with the tasting menu, I decided to venture along the a al carte path; choosing two starters, one entree, and two desserts. Although this may seem like a lot of food for one person, the portion sizes (as they have been mentioned in several reviews below) are only somewhat less than ample in size. <br><br>My waiter Emily was fantastic with her presentation: thorough with her informative descriptions and recommendations. She was also great at checking in at the right times, and was genuinely invested in her customer service and approach. The same applies to all of the gentlemen who served my dishes and replenished my water glass. All inquired as to how I was enjoying the meal, which was my favorite so far, etc.<br><br>The food here is completely mind blowing. Chicago is blessed to have chefs like Wolen and Galus - whose dedication to pushing the boundaries in regards to ingredient pairing and presentation are starkly recognized dish after dish after dish.<br><br>I received 7 pieces of amuse bouche in addition to the housemade breads and butter (THANK YOU CHEF WOLEN) and each of them were absolutely spectacular. The first four arrived before and during my starters:<br>1) kumamoto oyster with celery, and japanese vinegar: stellar! oceanic and briny and uber fresh<br>2) corn tartlet: creamy, cheesy, crunchy. incredible<br>3) pig head terrine with rhubarb kosho: lightly fried and crispy and savory. perfection<br>4) marinated fluke with pickled watermelon, lemon verbena, and radish: STELLAR. Inhaled this<br><br>The ricotta gnudi here is an absolute MUST. The exterior of the pasta was thin and soft, and once broken, revealed a perfectly pillowy ball of fresh ricotta. Once exposed, the onion broth was soaked inside of the gnudi and the flavors when mixed created an absolutely orgasmic experience for my taste buds.<br><br>The fontina tortelli was quality. The housemade pasta had just the perfect amount of salt and bite, The fresh fontina was salty and tangy as expected and once paired with the sweet, creamy corn...altogether it was equally as orgasmic as the gnudi. Verdict? Chef Wolen and his team are masters at pasta making. <br><br>The pork loin and belly is probably the strongest entree I have had in a while. There was so much going on (ingredient wise) yet somehow, these items wed together, making a stunning dish. The smoky pork loin and belly mixed with the sour cherries and bitter chinese broccoli was just too beautiful for words. <br><br>After the entree I was sitting (practically stuffed, yet determined to still partake in sweet somethings) when all of a sudden Chef Wolen was standing next to my table inquiring as to how I was enjoying my meal thus far. We spent a good 10 minutes conversing about the restaurant, the dishes I had, and our mutual excitement for Somerset (his 2nd restaurant opening in September). What a treat!<br><br>Not at all ready to end my experience at BOKA, I was ready for my two desserts.<br><br>The chocolate creme brulee was absolutely impeccable. The brulee was so dense and full of chocolate flavor, and mixed with the smoked almond ice cream and sweet and sour cherries...I was convinced I had died and gone to culinary heaven. <br><br>I felt similar with the apricot dessert. Apricot is such a hit or miss fruit for me and I was nervous when I ordered it. However, I am glad I did. The apricot was fresh and juicy, and the creme fraiche and apricot sorbet added just the perfect amount of citric acidity the dish needed when paired with the naturally super sweet apricot bits and honey.<br><br>The last 3 amuse bouche were the perfect little bites to end my night:<br>1) chocolate truffle with strawberry/rhubarb and vanilla compote inside: divine<br>2) chocolate filled coconut/almond dacquoise: pretty good (honestly not my favorite)<br>3) olive oil cake with raspberries: heavenly<br><br>All in all, I was very happy to have ordered a la carte. I ended up receiving right around the same amount of food as the tasting menu, but I was able to pick the items I knew I would enjoy. <br><br>This entire experience changed my life.

I am allergic to avocado and they were able to accommodate taking it out of the beets dish in the first course I ordered. I love beets so I'm happy they could do this. For the second course I had the egg. It was a very unique dish and more of a pasta dish which I wasn't expecting, but it was a nice surprise. The chicken was great, but a very small portion.

Texture wise it was great and I liked the crunchy peanut on it and the avocado mousse. Next I had the seared scallop which was delicious, seared right to the point. For Entree I had the grilled salmon. It was so soft and fresh and went well with the sauce. Only wish the skin was more crispy. For dessert I had the vanilla bean. Sooo good!

I had booked this reservation more than a week in advance, and even so we only got a late reservation (9:15PM) on Saturday evening. <br><br>We were happy that unlike many restaurants in Chicago, we were  seated at our table promptly upon arrival. The ambience is interesting. Dark wood everywhere rustic and refined at the same time. <br><br>Our server was extremely polite and helpful. We decided not to do the tasting menu and went the a la carte route instead. They recommend getting one hot appetizer, one cold appetizer, and dinner because the dinner portions are small. However, I must say this was not necessary. I think one appetizer and a main course for a person would have been fine. <br><br>The wine list here was extensive. Unfortunately, we couldn't converge on a bottle, so we went with individual glasses instead. The Italian wine I got was fabulous, smooth and not overly tart. My wife and daughter liked their wines as well. <br><br>For the cold appetizers, the server recommended the heirloom carrots. We got them after some hesitation but they were surprisingly good. We also got the asparagus which was covered with caramelized brioche and foie gras shavings --- delicious. In the hot appetizers,  the octopus was the star of the show. We also got the Broccoli Agnolotti, which came with goat gouda, lemon, black truffle and the  \"sweet breads,\"which were delicious. <br><br>For dinner, my wife and I shared the duck (it is meant to be shared by two). This was quite possibly the best duck I've tasted, I would say comparable to the orignal Peking Duck in  in Beijing, but this has a different flavor. They bring it to the table whole, and then they cut it up rather artistically served with foie gras sausage, spring onion, and rhubarb. The skin is made nice and crispy and tastes heavenly. The legs are made into a confit and served on the side. If you have to order just one dish on this menu, I'd get it, you won't regret it. The server recommended the roasted chicken, which was a pretty big meal and my son liked it a lot. I tasted it and it was very good, but I'm glad I got the duck :). The roasted lamb loin is also delicious here, and it's served with celery, artichoke, and glazed tongue. The portion of the lamb was surprisingly small though. <br><br>It was overall a perfect evening. I don't think I disliked any dish at all, and there were more than a couple that were simply sublime.

Our waiter knew a shit-ton about the wine pairings. It didn't mean much to me but was still impressive. Great service.

It was expectedly indulgent, but actually a little too much food for this broad. Had to take the duck home (which they replaced the pork with since I don't eat pork) and it was definitely still good the next day. Best bites- the oyster in the beginning was actually really flavorful; the smoked beets, however, stood out the most...supremely unique and delightful. I couldn't eat all the fish but thankfully boyfriend was able to help me out. Everything was good; a few things were fantastic. Also got the fermented orange drink with ras el hanout. Was so interesting. Wish I was drinking one right now. The morrocan spice almost gives it the essence of being a cocktail, but it's alcohol free. <br><br>My face: Not a cheap evening but I was all smiles after such a lovely experience with my beau.

Crudo - this was 3 slices of fish with a vinaigrette on top - good, like I would expect<br>2.) Grilled Scallops - it was ok, cooked well and not chewy but flavors didn't wow me - 1 bite size piece cut into tiny slices<br>3.) Frozen Foie Gras - I'm not sure what they did with this dish but there was a foamy foie gras flavor in a foamy pudding type consistency.  I love foie gras but this one lacked substance and because of it, I thought it was very interesting and such a unique use of the ingredient.  I enjoyed this dish because it was so different.<br>4.) Risotto - instead of the normal rice they use in a creamy risotto, this one used a larger grain to give it a grainy consistency.  The flavors were ok and it didn't wow me but it was ok.<br>5.) Sea bass - the fish was well cooked and light, served with some type of legume with a nice soft sauce over it.  My boyfriend liked this dish the best.  This dish was the only one I didn't think was overly salty, but again nothing that wow'ed me in terms of unique flavors.<br>6.) Duck with a duck sausage - The duck was cooked medium rare and I thought it would be a lot more tender than it was.  It was actually tough to bite into but the flavors were pretty good.  The skin was crispy.  I liked this dish, my bf doesn't like duck so he hated it.  But I finished the slice for both of us.  It was served with some pickled veggies.<br>7.) Dessert - olive oil ice cream with some crumbles and blueberry on top.  The ice cream was way too sweet and you could barely taste the olive oil.  The crumble had an after taste like crumbled Cherios.<br>8.) Dessert - Earl Gray ice cream with a chocolate genache and powder sugar.  I liked this dessert the best out of the two.  The genache was creamy and delicious and so was the ice cream.  Again, no wow factor but it tasted like it should.<br><br>Overall, the dishes were way too small and if we came hungry, we wouldn't have been full off this $130 - 8 course tasting menu.  For a $400 dinner with drinks, we felt like we could've spent the money elsewhere and ate well.  I love tasting menus and they usually come with a lot more food.  The fact that the dishes were underwhelming and that they weren't unique in flavors or execution was disappointing.  My boyfriend said the seats were also uncomfortable for having to sit here for 4 hours and the restaurant wasn't A/C'ed so it was very hot to enjoy dinner when dressed up.  Sad this Michelin star restaurant didn't live up to either of our expectations.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-o4WtD11_iv7lhOeZP4oRg/348s.jpg", "caption": "Earl Gray Ice Cream and Chocolate Genache"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fmmlrzf6rbXp3BgiMVg2NQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Olive oil ice cream"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/R1Mm50zDlhOI4PopkWvhoA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Duck"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "First off, shout out to Nicole for being such a fantastic server.

He's very friendly, knowledgable and treated us nicely. We shared 3 appetizers, Beef Tartare, Ricotta dumplings, and and a pasta with mushrooms cream sauce. Gosh, i've never had beef tartare this delicious before. Beef was super tender and it tasted nothing like raw beef. Perfectly seasoned. Best beef tartare I ever had. Pasta with mushroom cream sauce was also great, creamy and earthy. Ricotta dumpling was probably my least favorite out of the 3 but still delicious. I ordered short rib as my entree. I was surprised that it came looking like steak, more than typical short ribs. However, oh my, it was super tender melt in my mouth! Never had any short ribs that tender before in my life! I almost licked my plate!! We ordered a couple desserts to share. They were deconstructed desserts. One was named just Hazelnut and Coffee and the other one was just Sweet Corn. H & C one had coffee/chocolate mousse with coffee brittle, hazelnuts candied, some crumble of perhaps cookies. SC had some corn pudding of some sort, popcorn, and a few other ingredients I couldn't identify but they were both delicious. They also offered us some chocolate truffles with some kind of citrus cream inside at the end, which could be a dessert by itself.

Seared Salmon: Yum - incredibly juicy.  Cucumbers and green sauce added some refreshing flavors (4 stars)<br>6. Meats.  I got lamb neck and tongue with chanterelles and Chinese broccoli. Some of the juiciest, most tender lamb I've ever had.  (5 stars).  The wife got short rib with Maitake mushrooms which was also superb (5 stars).  Love how they paired some Asian ingredients in the main dishes.<br>7.

The butter was at the correct temperature for spreading and paired beautifully with the pretzel bun.  As a firm hater of all things mushroom, I couldn't stop eating the Fall Mushroom Tagliolini and the texture diversity of the Shima Aji Crudo was ridiculous.  The duck was without a doubt the best duck I have ever tasted. The duck confit was so well thought out.  The short ribs were yummy but they made them extra unique was the cubes of beets and cow tongue.  They looked exactly the same from the outside but until you bit into them, it was kind of trippy. Desserts were very interesting, especially the grape one, but not the best thing I've ever eaten. The free birthday cake was a nice touch too. The only thing boka could have done better was the logistics on our left overs. They put 2 separate entrees in the same to-go box and the front desk, where we were supposed to pick up our food, did no know that we had left overs.

The restaurant became the foundation for the company: An alchemy of great design, warm hospitality, and amazing Chefs. The restaurants rich history includes 6 consecutive Michelin Stars.

It would have been nice to try more dishes but we had to keep our budget in mind. <br><br>Here is what we ordered: <br><br>Cold dish:<br><br>Marinated Yellowtail * plum, pistachio, horseradish - very good dish! Perfect appetizer! They even split it into two plates for us which was a nice touch. If you like sushi then this new take will amplify your taste buds to a new level. <br>Entrée:<br><br>Roasted Lamb Loin & Belly * garlic, cherry, olives - Mmmm, already love lamb and I never had lamb belly before. It instantly reminded me of pork belly but with a much more gamey taste. The garlic and cherry were a nice touch and definitely made the dish stand out as something that I have never tasted before.<br> <br>Roasted Chicken * broccoli, almond, foie gras - Roasted chicken was perfectly cooked and still moist. The foie gras gravy that covered the chicken was just divine and I wish I could put that on everything.<br><br>Dessert: <br><br>Chocolate Cherry almond, lambic, dark chocolate, cherry bark - YUM!!

This dining experience was one of the best that we have ever had, and we cannot thank our server Augustus for that. <br><br>We had a reservation for dinner on a Saturday night and were seated immediately upon arrival in this beautiful, ornate, and spacious booth. This booth could definitely seat up to five people, but instead, my fiancé and I were given this romantic space to enjoy ourselves. We were promptly greeted by a staff member offering us refreshments, and after some recommendations, I chose the Devil's Luncheon and my fiancé chose the Shady Grove. We both absolutely loved our drinks - they were delicious, unique, and strong. The Devil's Luncheon was a perfect balance between sweet/tart, complemented perfectly by the creamy egg white on top. My fiancé loved the Shady Grove for quality gin and interesting take on mini boba (I didn't get to try it because unfortunately, I'm allergic to elderflower). <br><br>After some time perusing the menu, I asked Augustus for his recommendations for food, and with consideration for those recommendations, we ended up ordering the Dry Aged Beef Tartare, Grilled Spanish Octopus, Ricotta Dumplings, and the Whole Roasted Dry Aged Duck. I also asked him for his recommendations for wine, and after some interviewing, deliberation, and taste-testing, Augustus was able to find the most perfect wine for me.<br><br>The Dry Aged Beef Tartare was absolutely DIVINE... the beef was high quality and perfectly flavored. The pickled carrots really brought out the slight saltiness of the beef, especially because it wasn't overly acidic. Would 10/10 recommend this dish to anyone.<br><br>The Grilled Spanish Octopus was cooked perfectly and was able to be cut with a butter knife. The smoked hazelnut was creamy and balanced the intense flavor of the octopus, but was then even furtherly complemented by the pickled cauliflower and its acidity. Furthermore, the melon pieces added a very subtle sweetness that really pulled the entire dish together. Individually, the ingredients were wonderful; however, when combined with each other, it was a remarkable play on the balance of flavors. Would 10/10 recommend this dish to anyone.<br><br>The Ricotta Dumplings were so beautiful and delivered to us at the most perfect temperature. The casing for the dumpling itself is delicate but not too chewy or soft, and the ricotta inside was like heaven's pillow. The fried garlic really added to the creaminess of the ricotta and brought out the flavors of the dish even more. Although I found that it was delicious, it was probably my least favorite dish, simply because I'm not a huge cheese person. Otherwise, would 10/10 recommend this dish to anyone.<br><br>Now the Whole Roasted Dry Aged Duck....... They brought out the whole roasted duck on a bed of greenery, presented it to you in all its glory with its perfectly crisp and golden brown skin and wafting a heady essence, and then took it back to the kitchen to cut and plate for you. My fiancé and I each got a very generous portion of duck with a side of foie gras sausage, onion, and a cream that I unfortunately cannot recall its exact ingredients. After the plate was presented to you, the staff member then generously drizzled a cherry glaze over the foie gras sausage. The foie gras sausage was divine - salty, but perfectly balanced by the creaminess of the side dollop, as well as the tart/sweetness of the cherry. The duck itself.... This was literally the best duck I have ever had in my life. Cooked absolutely perfectly, you were able to cut through the duck without any trouble. The crisp skin and thin layer of fat truly were the winners - they carried most of the flavor but really complemented the pink, juicy meat of the duck itself. I would 10000/10 recommend this dish to anyone.<br><br>For dessert, we ordered the Hazelnut and Coffee, which actually surprised me with its intense flavors. The hazelnut foam/cream was absolutely eye-rolling (in a good way), but the entire dessert was really \"made\" when you ate it together with the whole milk ice cream and praline. The praline was slightly salty, and the whole milk ice cream was drool-worthy creamy. Would 10/10 recommend this dish to anyone.<br><br>The service overall was just phenomenal.

It's modern American fare that goes above and beyond the typical roasted chicken or steak and potatoes. Frankly, I would say this type of food is typically out of my comfort zone, but the reviews and chef reputation really propelled this restaurant into my \"top try\" list. Boka is participating in Restaurant Week this year, and the menu on the Choose Chicago website looked really amazing, so we made reservations well in advance and went to dine here.<br><br>One thing to note, the location is recessed away from the street, right next to Capri (which has a much bigger sign than Boka). We actually drove right by it the first time and had to circle the block. Valet is $14.00.<br><br>We were seated almost right away for our reservation - a high top booth across from the bar. I actually liked this location a lot. It's both in the heart of the restaurant and not. You can people watch without getting right into their business.<br><br>We were handed menus that are printed new everyday on fine stationery cardstock which was impressive. However, the first thing I noticed was how different the courses were to the one I saw on Choose Chicago. This is really important because I based my visit on a couple key things that they weren't offering this night! Unlike other restaurants featuring RW menus, theirs DOES change with what is fresh that day. (I told them they should really disclaim that on the RW menu that they submit...just to set the right expectations.) We ended up ordering and the manager did offer to make an accommodation to create one of the items that was removed from the menu. Kudos to Boka for that.<br><br>Between the two of us, we had the Marinated Hamachi (best thing EVER), Heirloom Carrots (who knew you can fancy up carrots?), Seared Scallop (perfectly prepared), Poached Egg (meh), Grilled Beef Short Rib (omg - this is the best short rib I have ever had), Slow Cooked Pork Neck & Belly (belly was amazing, neck was meh), Dark Chocolate Mousse (wow), and Mango Bergamot (also wow).<br><br>As you can see, everything was quite delicious. It's probably one of the top 10 best meals I have had ever had. The only \"miss\" was the egg. It was an egg. No matter what you do with it, it still tastes like an egg. It wasn't bad, by any means, but just \"okay\". And while portions were on the smaller side (possibly due to Restaurant Week), we both left with a full stomach after this 4-course meal. I would think that with normal menu items, sharing an entree instead of ordering separate ones or ordering just 3 regular sized courses would get you to the same point.<br><br>Sometimes restaurants don't put their best foot forward for RW, but Boka really shines through here. Very good food, good service, and an overall fun ambiance. Still dreaming about the hamachi and short rib (which is currently replaced by pork). I would not hesitate to return on a normal night. Simply amazing!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sI7MD4j-6oW_0eRFV2jtLQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "Hamachi, carrots, scallop, pork belly and neck, chocolate mousse."}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Great service.

I did not opt for the wine pairing with each, as I would have been more of a mess and therefore, lessening my overall palate celebration.  Unfortunately, I cannot recall the gentleman servers name, but he was very pleasant.  The ambience is upscale casual.  The decorum is romantic/ rustic.  The skeleton key they give you when you check your items is charming.  The only note is that it is dimly lit, therefore making my iPhone food photography challenging.  The tables also seem to be closer together than one would like.  Luckily, we sat towards the front of the restaurant by the window and only one table aside us.  <br><br>   Capital Oyster - togarashi, celery, apple<br>Now, I loathe oysters.  Something slimy that you swallow and do you actually chew to enjoy weirds me out.  Like when my dog gets a treat and inhales it without chewing.  Where's the satisfaction in that?  lol  Served on a bed of rocksalts, and seaweed.  Though it was swallowed like a shot, the taste of the apple was pleasant, the togarashi (Japanese seasoning) had a heat that's full and abrupt, but passes quickly.<br><br>   Crispy Sunchoke - everything spice, trout roe / Salsify - smoked onion yogurt, nori<br>Served on a wooden plank, carefully placed beautiful tastings.  The salsify stood out to me, the crispiness of the shredded fried root vegetable with the onion yogurt and the slight saltiness of the nori.  Perfection.<br><br>   Cured Fluke - sea urchin, tomato water dashi<br>Creamy fish with that delectable sea urchin taste (I could go to bed wrapped in sea urchin), and complimenting tomato water.<br><br>  White Asparagus - almond, bone marrow<br>Very creative dish, but not my favorite.<br><br>  Gnocchi - clams, sorrel<br>Tasty pillows of gnocchi, and the sauce too.  I could have eaten this all night. <br><br>Wild Alaskan Salmon - meyer lemon, peas<br> This salmon is dense and lean, with a more complex flavor than farmed.  Gently cooked, and just melted in your mouth.  <br><br>Crispy Veal Sweetbreads - preserved lemon, capers, fennel<br>Firm but tender texture.  Amazing little lamb nuggets, and the tartness of the lemon and capers was perfect to counteract the richness of the meat.<br><br>Roasted Lamb Loin & Belly - spring garlic, morels<br>First off, you had me at Morels.  This rich, fleshy mushroom with the honeycomb like surface is what vegetarians eat for meat!  The lamb was perfectly cooked, pink throughout the center and seared outside.  Flavorful to say the least.  <br><br>Rhubarb - coconut and vanilla<br>The rhubarb was tender and not at all bitter.  There was some candied lemon, popcorn (though seemed misplaced), and a flat meringue disc with powdered fruit.  Eye catching.  <br><br>Hazelnut & Coffee - praline, whole milk ice cream, toasted milk<br>A merriment of flavor, I enjoyed the overall textural differences and the gentleness of the milk ice cream.<br><br>I left very satisfied and full.  Then again, I did the tasting.  I think if you are going ala carte (which I've read many of the reviews), you may be disappointed in the portion size.  As a patron of the tasting menu, all is good.  Now, where's that sea urchin for me to go to sleep with?  lol", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MuxaqrfPQenqGxcZVIsPlg/348s.jpg", "caption": "Pear & Coconut Fromage Blanc Beignets, wattleseed, lemon, bits of popcorn"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/h416Wg4UEq98zSQxVlrpng/168s.jpg", "caption": "Dessert Menu"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qlgGAuE36lY0hI7UFl8hVw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Roasted Spanish Octopus, fennel, persimmon, nori"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Similar to what others have said, I came expecting food to match the top-notch service experience and left disappointed.<br><br>The service and atmosphere are impeccable.

The waiters carry a nice down-to-earth feel mixed in with the pride of working there, and the sultry lighting and food are enough to make you forget about what you're wearing anyway. <br><br>We had a reservation for the evening, but next time I'd actually like to check out the bar. In line with everything else here, it was dark, Western, and unique. And, I mean, have you seen the drink menu?<br><br>The menu of the season was pretty Asian-inspired, which I wasn't expecting for a more American-flavored audience. After choosing our selections and settling down with some wine, we were started with a complimentary cup (more like a generous shot) of chilled pea and black olive soup - quite refreshing, and not enough olive to deter me from downing the whole thing (in case you couldn't guess, I don't generally like olives). We also chose two rolls from the traveling bread man, which we buttered with a delicious house-made lemon-infused butter. Off to a good start so far! The actual appetizer, Marinated Striped Bass, was pretty good, but also not up my alley since I'm not a huge fan of sashimi and related dishes. However, the green almonds and light seasoning got my attention. The main courses: Grilled Beef Short Rib (and other cow parts) and Peking Duck Breast. I was a little curious as to how they would interpret duck, which in Chinese tradition is roasted to crispy on the outside but tender and greasy on the inside savoriness. This duck was very tender, and the secret, we learned from our friendly waiter, was sous vide. We were surprised by how moist it stayed through the cooking process. The short rib wasn't as exciting, but it seemed well-prepared and has certainly made me consider eating more medium-rare meat. <br><br>We got a surprise at the end of our meal as well in the form of a little wooden box of Earl Grey and Chocolate Fudge truffles. The overall meal was well-presented, balanced, enjoyable to eat, and didn't leave me feeling stuffed. The duck was probably the most interesting offering of the evening, and I'm sure I have to let my palate mature a little to fully appreciate the other tastes presented throughout our dinner. I was actually very happy that the waitstaff wasn't in our faces all the time or overly deferential - it's not fun to eat when you're expected to smile and nod every 5 minutes.

The restaurant is spacious and has plenty of seating; great for groups of all sizes. What I love most is that there's enough space from other tables that you still maintain some privacy with your friends and family and aren't unintentionally eavesdropping on other parties' conversations.<br><br>My sister and I had planned on splitting our dishes down the middle so we each got to try a little bit of everything. For our cold dish, we got the heirloom carrots and the hamachi. Loved both but the heirloom carrots really stood out- Savory, sweet, and tender. We both got the scallops for our second dish. Cooked to perfection and the sear was beautiful. For our main course, we got the arctic char (on the lighter side and overall a very balanced dish) the short rib- practically melted in my mouth. My sister was sneaky and ate most of the short rib when I was splitting up the arctic char in half, but as they say, you snooze you lose! Lastly, was the dessert: coffee hazelnut and the mango bergamot. Outstanding finish to an amazing meal.<br><br>It was clear to me that each dish was very well thought out. From the presentation of the food (absolutely stunning) to the taste (delicious), to the ambiance (intimate and cozy), Boka really shined. The service was decent, although sometimes I felt as though some of the staff were hovering. Regardless, we were well taken care of. Well done, Boka!

To the restaurant's credit, when I contacted them about what happened, they refunded the meal completely AND sent a gift card for the same amount so that I'd come back and give them another chance. It took a very long time, but I finally went back last night. Between last year's reopening and it being Restaurant Week (and the fact that it's been half a decade!), I decided it was a safe time to return. I am still scarred when it comes to ever ordering scallops anywhere, but I'm happy to say my experience from this visit is much more positive!<br><br>We were seated at a table that was nice and cozy, particularly because the leather chairs were so comfortable. Our server (as well as the bussers and food runners!) was very friendly and helpful. Also very patient since he's obviously answering the same exact questions for 2 weeks  as Boka is not offering their regular menu during this time. <br><br>Skipped the optional wine pairing and ordered the \"right on time\" cocktail, which was sweet from the fruit puree, but not overly so. My husband got one of the whiskey cocktails, which he really enjoyed and was along the lines of a manhattan or old fashioned. <br><br>Our meal started with some complimentary pretzel bread. It was a mini roll and somehow they were able to replicate the taste of hard pretzels, while keeping the roll soft and fresh. The lemon zest in the butter had a nice flavor too. <br><br>COLD: I had the roasted beets, which I really liked. I'm a big fan of beets in general, but the yogurt and almond made them taste even better. <br>My husband ordered the heirloom carrots, which were even better, but on the sweeter side.<br><br>HOT: Celery root soup. Ok, but kind of boring. If you don't like root vegetables, I don't recommend it, because the flavor is strong. And it is a cream based soup so was a little filling. <br>Slow poached egg. Good and also filling thanks to the grains. <br><br>ENTREES: Arctic char. I really liked this partially because of the \"lightly smoked\" aspect and partially because of the sauces. Also a pretty decent sized portion. <br>Pork neck and pork belly. I didn't really try this one, but my husband said he really liked the flavors so there ya go. <br><br>DESSERT: Mango bergamot. So light and fresh aka my favorite kind of dessert as a non-dessert liking person. <br>Dark chocolate mousse. So many chocolatey flavors in various forms. I am not a chocolate person so I basically just had a tiny bite to try. Based on my husband's completely empty plate though, he was a big fan. <br><br>We were also given 2 post dinner passion fruit filled chocolate truffles. I am, again, not a chocolate fan, but my husband had both and didn't complain. <br><br>I'm glad I got the courage to come to Boka again as we really enjoyed our evening.

I often joke that if I didn't meet my husband before finding Boka, perhaps I would have tried to meet Chef Wolen and married him instead.

My tasting menu is typically swapped out for a pescatarian menu (and the restaurant is always accommodating to do so). The tasting menu at Boka is an excellent option in my opinion because it allows you to try a little bit of everything without having to decide between all of their excellent options on your own. In this particular tasting menu, I had a lobster dish and an octopus dish that were to DIE for. <br><br>Currently they have a gold drink on their menu with 24k gold in it. Yes, actual gold. You must order it. The other cocktails on the menu that I've had, including the Boka Old Fashioned, among others, are always properly balanced and match well with your meal. If you don't like it, let your server know; they truly want you to have a great experience. <br><br>Another note, the service on Boka is incredible. I've actually tried to time how long (if ever) my empty water glass sits on the table. And their service staff makes it a point to be invisible, but will interact with you if you'd like...Their attention to detail is what pushes the Boka experience over the edge for me. <br><br>I truly cannot say enough about Boka.

You might ask why lighting is so incredibly important to someone as youthful as I, but I can assure you it is. More than the outstanding atmosphere and decor of the entire space, Boka has it all really. The food is obviously delicious and consistently so, but also the service as well. I still have not yet discovered an equally-meticulous approach to food anywhere else in the city, and yes; I do get around. <br><br>At Boka, everyone moves across the rooms in sort of a soft, courtly dance if you will. The water approaches from one side as the tartare arrives from the other, both coming together at once in a seamless finale. It is almost as if I can hear in the distance a small metronome swaying back and forth to a silent symphony. But really, the timing of each course is absolutely perfect (unless of course one has an engagement at the theatre -- in that case, the wonderfully-accommodating staff at Boka will speed the overall timing, but the courses will still remain perfectly spaced).<br><br>Okay, in all seriousness, I love this place and I can't believe I've waited so long before writing my review, as I consider it to be amongst my top five favourite restaurants in the U.S.  <br><br>What do I love? It's difficult for me to put my finger on exactly what sets Boka apart from all the rest, but I imagine it begins with the impeccable overall \"look and feel\" of the restaurant. The food is outstanding as is the carefully-curated wine list, but I'll start with why I like the look and feel. <br><br>First, everything is perfect -- the absolutely-perfect lighting, the classically modern mix of furniture and art, the weight of the flatware, the spotless wine glasses (with the right glass type for the body of wine -- SO important, but often done wrong), and the restaurant is spotless. <br><br>Second, the staff always makes a special effort to make you feel welcome and comfortable. Certainly, in this caliber of restaurant, the staff/management should know every detail -- and they do. Plus, there is such a refreshing sense of unpretentiousness, which makes the experience even better. <br><br>Finally, although it sounds trite to say, I really enjoy the ambiance of each of the rooms in Boka. Each room has its own \"vibe\" and all spots are lovely and perfect for quiet conversation. The bar, in particular, has a friendly and approachable staff. They serve really unique cocktails and are super knowledgeable about wine as well.<br><br>Okay, I'm getting to the food. I don't think I can accurately explain how consistently delicious the food is at Boka. I am particularly fond of the Dry Aged Beef Tartare and Roasted Spanish Octopus starters. One of my favorite entrées is the Roasted Chicken, which has charred sweet potato, quince and a mouthwatering foie gras sauce. The menu changes sometimes seasonally, but Chef Lee always creates beautifully unique dishes and pays attention to texture and subtlety with regard to combining flavors (specifically, the Dry Aged Beef Tartare has this wonderful mix of softness and crunch on the palette -- just lovely).<br><br>Honestly, I cannot say enough about Boka so I'll end my review in simply urging you to try it.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This place on yelp on a whim and decided to make a reservation.

Each time a dish was described, I wondered how it would come together (veal sweetbreads with pickled blueberries and fermented cabbage?)--and then it did, perfectly, each time.

It is also quiet and laid back on week nights; my personal preference. <br><br>We tried a couple of appetizers, but I cannot recall exactly what I tried. As my entree, I ordered the seared monkfish. All of the items that I tried were underwhelming. The entire meal I couldn't help but feel that the chef's were trying to be experimental just for the sake of it; rather than adding anything substantial to the taste.

It was quite nice. <br><br>They bring out a beet soup to begin, which is very light and refreshing. I highly recommend trying it. The wine menu is extensive and definitely holistic. We ordered a syrah, I believe it was Saint Joseph Offerus. For starters, I got the grilled Octopus which was cooked to perfection and had an awesome parsnip puree accompanying the dish. Then I had the beef tartare. Normally I like the tartare to be served with some type of bread so you can scoop it up, but this did not need any bread. There was something on top giving it a delightful crunch and it was really prepared very well. For my entree, I ordered the halibut. The menu changes each season so it's not necessarily going to be on the menu after spring 2016. It was served in a broth that was reminiscent of Ramen. Again, the dish was amazingly flavorful and light. There were sliced green strawberries on top that added just a hint of acidity. For dessert I ordered the mango & citrus. Boy, was that good! It was mango sorbet with an angel food cake and coconut whipped cream!! Holy moly. Oh and little tapico pearls added just a bit of really lovely texture. <br><br>Lastly, I'll say that this place treats everyone like Kings and Queens. They are super hospitable and friendly. Everytime I got up to use the washroom, a staff member showed me to the loo.

Anyway, this was the 'end of the year' dinner for my girlfriend and me and it was pretty good. Didn't blow me away, and I'm always hesitant about these high end joints because I usually never get full from them, but this place was fine.<br><br>Ended up ordering the octopus, roasted chicken, and grilled short rib. Really adventurous am I right? Well that's what had the most positive reviews from Yelp and those are my people so I trust them. Didn't steer me too wrong this time either. Octupus was pretty good. So many flavors though, wasn't sure how exactly that one was suppose to taste. It was nice because they split it for us too. Short ribs were pretty good. I just realized right now since I'm on the Boka website looking at the menu, that the thing on the side of the short ribs was tongue. Whoa, didn't know that at the time and I just ate it. Weird. The chicken I wasn't too fond of but the girlfriend liked it.<br><br>It was a little loud in there so when the waiters brought the food and explained what things were, I couldn't really hear them and just nodded. My fault I suppose. Those everyone working there is so nice. Our waitress was great, really into her job and seemed to love it. The hostess was nice too, and if you ask where the bathroom is, they walk you all the way to the stairs, where it it. How nice.

I have to say that after eating here I felt as if I needed to make a run to McDonald's for a cheeseburger or hell even chicken strips. I can't say I would ever recommend the  tasting menu here.<br><br>It was very underwhelming overall. This is with the wine pairing mind you. I paid extra for the \"reserve\" wine pairing it was quite mediocre.

The sommelier is very knowledgeable. We did not wait long for service and all of our questions about the wines and courses were answered. He's very enthusiastic about their selections (I don't know why) and he clearly enjoys his job.<br><br>The pour for the wine pairings was super stingy. For $115 you would think they'd be a little more generous. I know a proper pour is  3-4 ounces but I was getting like 2 ounces maximum on the \"expensive\" stuff. Also it's not unusual to get up to 5 ounces in a pour; many high end restaurants do this. So yeah the wine pairing upgrade isn't worth it, imo. My boyfriend had the standard pairing and there were a number of times that I preferred his glass of wine to my more expensive versions and he received more generous pours.<br><br>You're not slick Boka, I noticed. I've always heard it rumored that restaurants give men bigger pours since it's assumed that they'll be paying the bill so they want to keep them happy, lol. Not saying Boka did this but ...

We were on a foie gras foodie weekend exploring various Chi-town restaurants known for their foie gras dishes. Through my mom's research she found a few \"top foie gras restaurants in Chicago\" including Naha and Boka. After surveying the few spots I think Boka was my overall favorite restaurant and happened to have the best foie gras dish. Overall, Boka was a great experience from start to finish. We were warmly greeted by the hostess who had our reservation and table ready to go. As soon as you walk in you can't help but notice the cool décor. There were dark, earthy tones, but still a brightness to it all. There were unique light bulb, shadow, reflection pieces on the wall that my dad couldn't stop admiring all night.<br>We were greeted by a friendly waiter who had a certain \"pizazz\" about him. As I looked over the menu one might think \"oh another overpriced bougie restaurant with mediocre food,\" but boy can you be more wrong. We ordered the two Smoked Foie Gras & Tte de Cochon appetizers, Grilled Spanish Octopus appetizer, Grilled Beef Short Rib, Roasted Chicken, and Seafood Bucatini Special. After ordering we were given the option of pretzel bread or a dairy free alternative. At this point nothing too spectacular has happened until we are served chilled cauliflower soup with fish roe, apple chunks, and sprinkled with something crunchy in a small dish. It was more of a cool foam dish that you see on Chopped rather than soup. At first we were all skeptical until we took our first bites. IT WAS DELICIOUS. The flavors all had a dance party in your mouth with explosions of saltyness from the fish roe. My dad, once again more of a traditional foodie was happily surprised as he finished his cauliflower soup with a \"damn, that was good.\"<br>The meal continued to impress as we received good size portions of foie gras that melted in your mouth. It was accompanied by some sauce and veggies, but the simplicity of the seared delicacy was all you really needed. The octopus appetizer was good as well served with a dynamic balsamic sauce (I think), some kind of puree, and slivers of veggies. The char was just right without drying out the meat. For the main course, the seafood bucatini special (which was actually an appetizer) was my favorite. The green sauce was savory and rich complemented by shrimp, muscles, and more. The bucatini was coated perfectly in sauce and was al dente - just the way I like it. This was the type of dish that you can only eat so much of because of the richness, but you can't help but finish the whole thing. My next favorite dish was the roasted chicken breast. Now as an Asian family chicken breasts aren't always the highest on the list to order (grandma says dark meat is where all the flavor is). This chicken breast dish blew that philosophy out of the water. From outside to inside - crispy chicken skin, stuffed with chicken sausage, and then the actual breast meat. When the dish was served a sauce was poured over it at the table. The one negative to the dish was that it was accompanied by a foie gras foam/sauce. Unfortunately, you couldn't really taste any foie gras unless you really looked for it. The dish (that I ordered of course) that was lowest ranked was the short rib. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't as delicious as the other plates. The meat was cooked perfectly, but the sauce didn't enhance the flavors for me.<br>At this point we've had a few glasses of wine and were pretty stuffed, but dessert was a must. We went with the most popular dish (according to the waiter) called \"Chocolate and Hazelnut.\" I was practically licking the dish and would have if I wasn't at a nice sit down dinner. Not only was the dish visually gorgeous, but the flavors all came together perfectly. The dessert consisted of whole milk ice cream, hazelnut foamy/light custard (don't even know how to describe it), a coffee sugar glass, brown sugar crumble with crushed hazelnuts, and a caramel/brown butter sauce (again poured over the dessert at the table). You could either enjoy each bite separately to savor the individual flavors or get a solid spoon of the various aspects. I love sweet and salty, which is exactly how I would describe this dessert. This is an absolute \"must get\" if you go. <br><br>So now you might think my review is over, but not quite. A few more things happened that night that I must note. The bill was accompanied by dish of candied citrus and homemade salted peanut butter cups. After such a great dessert I was hesitant to add more sweetness to my palate, but I'm happy I did. The dessert wasn't too processed and worth the extra calories.<br> <br>I need to address the guest service and amazing staff at Boka.

I was slightly trepidatious I was able to book so easily last minute. However, my worries slowly alleviated starting from the minute the host, Aaron?, opened my door once he saw me walking towards their entrance from a distance. By the time the appetizer course came out, all doubts had dissipated. Their service is STELLAR!  Reminds me of my NYC dining experiences which makes sense because chefs are EMP (Eleven Madison Park) alumnus. Let's face it, most of us are not dining out at fancy restaurants every night of the week. It's normally because we are celebrating a special occasion or our meals are being expensed. Hence, service is a pivotal part of the whole fine dining experience. Boka is able to walk that fine line between warm friendly professional. My server Nicole was genuinely enthused about her job and very knowledgable about the menu when I asked for recommendations. I tasted quite a few dishes:<br><br>Appetizers:<br>Beet salad*- my favorite; compliments of the kitchen <br>Sweetbreads -yummy<br>Poached egg - also very tasty <br>Foie gras - very interesting (good) rendition; not like the usual pate we've been accustomed to<br><br>Entrees:<br>Chicken*- I'm not a fan of chicken but this dish knocked my socks off.

That was really good. The kitchen sent me another complimentary dish - a cute square box with cocoa dusted marshmallows and chocolate hazelnut.<br><br>I discovered Metropolitan Brewing Beer through the server's recommendation. It's a locally based brewery that's quite tasty. The beer can be hard to procure at liquor stores in Chicago. Trader Joe's Lincoln Park used to carry them but not anymore. Let me say the cocktails are just amazing at Boka. I ordered four and for reference I can barely finish half a glass of wine because I am such a lightweight.

Since wine is expensive here, they offer a choice between a half glass and a full glass. I have never paid $30 for one glass of wine, most likely because I don't have a very fine wine palate, but there are few options here for a full glass of wine at a decent price. Expect to pay extra and treat yourself with the alcohol here. The perks of going to a restaurant like this is that they give you compliments of the chef for \"free\" throughout your meal, a few being an amuse bouche mousse with cauliflower and roe, choice of a bread roll with to-die-for homemade lemon butter, and truffles/candied grapefruit for dessert with coffee.<br><br>To start my mom and I ordered the Chicory Salad and the Heirloom Carrots. Both of these dishes packed a major sensory punch--they were crunchy, delectable, and boasted a complex layering of flavors. The carrots came with pistachios, amaranth, and smoked goat cheese, and the Chicory Salad included beets, yogurt, almonds, frisee, and rye crumble. For our entrees, we ordered the Roasted Chicken and Grilled Beef Short Rib. The Roast Chicken was cooked to perfection--it was moist and had a crispy film of skin coating the top. It came with foie gras, butternut squash, and steamed greens. I loved the combination of everything on the plate and tried to get a little piece of each with every forkful. I was skeptical of ordering chicken at a place like this, but I was not at all disappointed with my choice. The Beef Short Rib was fantastic! This dish really steals the spotlight on the menu. The beef was full of flavor and had a melt-in-your-mouth quality. I barely got in a bite because my mom was rapidly enjoying this dish. <br><br>Overall, this establishment is very classy and the food presentation was elegant. Every menu item we ordered was expertly prepared and each dish had a unique texture involving some type of crunch to indulge the senses.

We had multiple wait staff coming to our table to inquire about dietary restrictions, as well as after each plate was set down, to ask if we were enjoying the dish. They even made sure we were out in time for our show down the street at the theater. They truly strive to please you here!

The service was wonderful as well. My boyfriend and I got a corner table with plush pillows and a connected sofa seat. <br><br>For the price of the meal, I was a little let down by only being impressed by 3/7 courses. Before our first course we got a corn soup that tasted mostly like salad dressing. The first course was a raw fish dish that was wayyyy too salty, although the fish itself had great texture and was very fresh. The saltiness of the whole tasting menu was on the high end. The second course was a heirloom tomato salad which had punches of sweetness and basil but in my opinion was a confused dish with too many flavors fighting each other. It wasn't until the third course that I was convinced that I was eating at a Michelin star restaurant. The creme brûlée foie gras was sooooo delicious! The fourth course was basically an elevated fillet-o-fish, same flavors and texture but with an extra cucumber sauce drizzled. The fifth course was sweetbreads.... We tried it but couldn't get over the weird texture. Risky move on Boka's part that didn't pay off. The sixth course was ribeye steak that was delicious - the second dish of the night that I really liked. Last course was a sorbet dessert that was pretty mediocre.

However what would be sadder is if I hadn't dined there at all. Therefore, my predicament is not so bad after all. Better late than never, right? <br><br>Being right next door to Alinea, Boka has a lot to prove. Having a Michelin star though is not shabby at all. In fact, it's kind of a big deal. I wonder if they lose staff a lot in between restaurants as who wouldn't want to say they have worked for Grant Achatz and Nick Kokonas? The chef at Boka however, Chef Lee Wollen, has a long credentials himself, which really intrigued me in trying his food. He had worked a long time at Eleven, the reigning #1 restaurant in the US and #3 in the world, as well as El Bulli. Whoa.<br><br>At times, I really don't care who the chef is as long as the food is good. However, there are times when credentials and accomplishments definitely need to be given credit, such as this one. It definitely showed  in the dishes.<br><br>The restaurant is fancy like a fancy restaurant should be. It had a little terrace before you went in and the hostess with a big smile opened the door for you and before you knew it, you were seated. There were people in really dressy evening outfits, and there were us dressing towards the casual side. The crowd was definitely mixed.<br><br>I was surprised looking at the menu that they didn't have a degustation (tasting menu). I wasn't expecting to choose as I wanted to try it all. However, it was pretty cool as the menu was pretty contained and it was easy to choose. They focus on seasonal ingredients, so I went for things with morels and ramps - ingredients that I knew in season currently. <br><br>They started us with pea soup with olive oil, a gift from the chef. It was in a sake cup to sip. It was clean, cold, and really started the palette lightly but surely. I ordered the spicy garlic soup with peekytoe crab, mustard, and caraway seeds. Oh my God...it was silky garlicky kill vampire perfection. It was so so so good. Edward Cullen, Count Dracula, Marcus and Selene would all die happy if they were force fed the soup. It was definitely tastier than sucking blood.<br><br>My friends got the brandade ravioli with artichoke, lemon, and sorel in a foamy broth as well as the grilled spanish octopus with eggplant, rhubarb, and sesame. Ravioli was exquisite and so delicate. The octopus....mh, it was unbelievable! The chunks made me believe it was a giant octopus. They were huge! They were thumb size and they were so tender and beautifully prepared. We actually ordered another plate to share!<br><br>For entrée, I went with short ribs with tongue, morels, and ramps. I really wanted fish but Evi called the poached cod with razor clam first. The other fish was trout, which I hate. Therefore, I chose the morels and ramps with the short ribs. My friend, Sabrina, went for the Pekin duck breast with turnip and black garlic. Mine was so delicious. The rib was cooked like steak and there was a mousse on the plate that tasted like a liver mousse and a couple other chunks of meat that might have been tongue? I really didn't examined but they were so damn amazing. The cod was covered in another foamy liquid and it seemed Evi had a foamy theme tonight. The duck was actually my favorite. Between the crispy skin and the medium rare breast..oh it was just flavor and texture all over the place and I just loved that duck breast in my mouth. Nate is a vegetarian and he ordered the broccoli dish and he said it was good but salty. <br><br>My least favorite part was dessert. We ordered two and the coffee and hazelnut praline with whole milk ice cream was definitely the better one. The caramel roasted banana was not a winning dessert at our table. The banana was weird. However, they gave us more desserts of handmade truffles. <br><br>The service was impeccable as it would be and it was more easy going and personable. There was little to none stuffiness with the staff and they catered to you instead of telling patrons \"this is how we do it here\" like most restaurants this caliber would do. <br><br>The portion was huge too and it was another surprising thing. We already planned for second session at String Ramen down the road but we axed that as we were absolutely stuffed. Plus, the price wasn't bad. I had a cocktail and a three course meal and I paid less than a hundred with tip. Let's just say that was 1/6 of what I paid next door at Alinea, granted there were more courses and booze.<br><br>It was a great time and we had a lot of fun at Boka. The food itself was the star and knowing how we love the other creation of Boehm and Katz, Momotaro, we were not at all surprised of how great Boka was.

When we arrived, we were promptly seated and our waiter was with us right away. The ambiance at Boka is very chic, modern, and intimate, making it perfect for any occasion - there were people on dates, a couple of groups of friends out for a nice dinner, and even a party of 8, all enjoying themselves.<br><br>The service here is great. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. There was never a point in the night where we wondered where our waiter was - it seemed like he had an uncanny 6th sense for this. Also, the restaurant was able to whip up a kid-friendly dish (pasta w/ chicken in a butter sauce), so a big kudos for them for offering a something that my little cousin could eat.<br><br>My #1 rule when dining out is if there's a tasting menu offered, you should do it, and that's exactly what we did. We all opted to go for the 7-course tasting menu ($115) + wine pairing (only $45 - what a great deal!). The tasting menu consisted of some items from the a la carte menu, along w/ some dishes created by the chef himself. All the dishes were very good and were paired excellently w/ their respective wine. Just a note, the tasting menu was primarily seafood so it was mainly white wines. My favorites from the night would have to be the diver scallops and the beef short ribs and beef tongue. I like diver scallops, but they're not something I usually go crazy over, however the diver scallop here had a nice crust to it and the sauce + pickled green strawberries that accompanied it was great. The beef short ribs were amazingly tender, and beef tongue is always good, and at Boka it was no exception.

Next we ordered the dry aged beef tartare and the grilled spanish octopus. The beef tartare was topped with pickled mustard and what seemed to be dried fruit which was an interesting take on the dish. Either way, it worked. The spanish octopus was the weakest dish of the meal. The flavors were quite bland. I finished off with the dry aged rohan duck. Everything about this entree was incredible.

Score! We got it a day in advance, so I guess we were pretty darn lucky. We were also pretty darn lucky to find nearby street parking for free! Double score. We arrived 10 minutes early, but we were seated as soon as we arrived. <br><br>Ambiance: Very cool and classy without making me feel out of place. There were even paintings of Bill Murray and Dave Grohl on the walls. It doesn't get much cooler than that, eh? Little details like that made me feel like, \"I can belong here,\" even as a twenty-something poor grad student. I really liked decorations like cool door locks all over the door/closet for the coat check. I was only mildly creeped out that there were hands holding candles on the walls. We were seated near a window next to a busy street, which was a little off-putting to me at first. There was hardly anyone else in the rest of the restaurant and we were seated right next to a large group of people visiting Chicago on business. I heard everything they all said about hedge funds and real estate. Every. Word. It did take away from the romantic atmosphere for me, especially with buses and wailing sirens in the street right outside. This was really the only disappointing thing about our entire meal. my chair was very comfortable, at least. <br><br>Service: Boka really knocked it out of the park. The hostesses were both really friendly and professional. They checked our coats after we arrived and were also happy to take pictures for us before we left. Lots of attention to detail, like asking if we wanted the picture without flash, also. Our waitress was really, really professional and friendly. This is the best combination. What really took the cake was that, after our first two courses, she brought out two flutes of generously poured complimentary champagne. I guess my girlfriend had mentioned that we were celebrating Valentine's Day early and she said that she and her boyfriend weren't able to see each other that often, so she understood. It was very thoughtful of them to do something like that. It really made us feel special and welcome. They deserved that generous tip, for sure. <br><br>Food: I'm going to take you on a journey from plate to plate, start to finish (cold, hot, entree, dessert). <br><br>Beets: Wow. It was like I was starting off the meal with a dessert. Beets were so sweet, soft, and bursting with different flavors. The peanuts, pumpernickel, avocado, and blue cheese all worked very well together. Excellent dish.<br><br>Pork belly: This was basically like biting into a very thick, soft, succulent, sweet, savory slab of bacon. My mouth is watering thinking about it. The celery, chestnut, and olives all added to a wonderful symphony of flavors. <br><br>Grilled beef short rib: This was the standout dish for me in a cast of all-stars. The beef was incredibly tender and cooked to perfection. I gave my pescetarian gf a bite (slowly but surely, I'm going to convert her) and she couldn't believe how delicious it was. <br><br>Poached pear and chocolate cake: My girlfriend and I actually ended up splitting the desserts because we both kind of wanted the chocolate cake but also wanted to sample more of the menu. My gut feeling wanting the chocolate cake dessert was right, as I preferred it to the poached pear. There were so many flavors going on in the chocolate cake, including chocolate mousse, gingerbread, and vanilla ice cream. The poached pear was great, too--perfectly soft, oozing, and with a killer bourbon ice cream scoop. <br><br>Boka is very much deserving of its Michelin star, without a doubt.

Some restaurants will also serve their regular menu alongside the Restaurant Week menu; Boka is not one of them - if you go during Restaurant Week, the prix fixe menu is all you will get. This was okay with me because that's specifically why we made the reservation in the first place, but just a heads up (and they do a good job of making sure that you know this going in - when they called to confirm my reservation, they mentioned it.)<br><br>Without further ado, onto the food! The four courses were a cold appetizer, a hot appetizer, an entree, and a dessert. I chose the heirloom carrot salad, the pork belly, the grilled short rib, and the chocolate cake respectively. The highlight of the night was by far the grilled short rib, which came with celery root puree, onion, and some other veggies that I honestly didn't pay too much attention to because the star of the dish - the short rib itself - was amazing. Most places serve short rib braised, but the grill made it very interesting - great sear/char on the outside, which made it a little crispy, yet tender and flavorful on the inside. I've heard that it's also on their regular menu, which I'm very glad about because it means I can go back another time and order it again. Highly recommend this dish.<br><br>Everything else was great as well, the short rib happened to just stand out as my favorite. The carrot salad came with goat cheese and I liked that the carrots themselves were tender (I almost never cook with carrots so the only way I ever eat them is cold and raw). Pork belly was yummy, no idea how they cooked it as it was pretty different from other pork belly that I've eaten but still great. The chocolate cake came in the form of small muffin-shaped pieces with a scoop of cardamom ice cream and some chocolate mousse (I think?). Either way, tasty and a great way to round off the meal.<br><br>They also gave us some little orange sweets - similar to pâte de fruit - to round off the meal.

Nevertheless, Boka gave us such a great experience on my girlfriend's birthday that I felt compelled to write a review here. <br><br>The service was excellent. We were greeted and offered our choice of sitting in either the covered or uncovered patio area. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu with not an ounce of pretension. We were given ample time to enjoy our meal, allowing us to really savor each course. <br><br>Before we started out our meal, the chef sent out complimentary asparagus puree shooters garnished with edible flowers. Delicious. We then went with the tangerine marinated snapper carpaccio, which had a pleasantly surprising kick of flavor. The chef sent out another complimentary item. I don't remember how the server described it, but it was a crudo / sashimi dish. The fish was fresh; the taste delicate yet well balanced.<br><br>Next came the seared foie gras. The flavor was outstanding and the texture was spot on. Not much more needs to be said about this standout dish. One of my favorites of the evening was the mac 'n cheese with edamame, which was bursting with rich flavor. <br><br>For our main course we ordered the Faroe Island Salmon and the Short Rib Agnolotti, both of which we did not regret. The salmon was well seared and the fish itself was fattier than most salmon, which made for a nice flavor. It was served on a bed of black rice made risotto style. The agnolotti was excellent and each was generously filled with that delicious short rib. Accompanied by poached lobster and drizzled nicely with oil and a delicious broccoli sauce, the dish was more than satisfying. The night ended with complimentary mignardises, which included among other things, marshmallow cubes, peanut brittle, and caramel fudge. <br><br>The entire dinner service went as well as we could have imagined, and I'm glad we decided on this restaurant for such a special day!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Amazing!!!!!!<br>Comfortable, interesting and inviting atmosphere with tremendous service from the minute you walk in the door.

We had a wonderful time. I really like this place.<br><br>First, parking can be a bit of a pain. The restaurant is located near Steppenwolf Theater so parking is scarce, even at 9pm. <br><br>We were a few minutes late for our reservations, but that was fine because they were waiting on tables to clear. Not a big deal, we sauntered over to the bar to get a couple of drinks. I got a winter beer, and the boyfriend got an oatmeal stout (not Samuel Smith). I like my beer a lot better (because his wasn't the Samuel Smith one), but unfortunately I can't remember the name of it.<br><br>Shortly after we took our first sips, the host came to find us to let us know that our table is ready. We didn't end up dining in the actual dining room. Instead, we dined in an extended part of the restaurant. It was still nice, but not as nice as the dining room. <br><br>We ordered speedily as we already knew what we wanted. I think our server was impressed by how easy it was to take our order. <br><br>For our first course, we ordered the wild mushroom soup and the seared diver scallops. The soup came with black garlic confit chicken thigh, bok choy, and shallot marmalade topped with a parmesan crisp. It was very delicious. I loved the fragrance of the mushrooms, roasted bok choy, garlic and shallots. The chicken was done well, and it wasn't too dry. The scallops were sitting on top of bamboo rice, cello spinach, pickled Buddha's Hand, and curried celery root. I've had a lot of different rice before, but I don't think I've ever had bamboo rice. It was very good, and eating it together with the spinach and the celery root reminded me of risotto, but without the cheese. The pickled Buddha's Hand was very lemony in flavor. I've had these before in Chinese food, but never at a non-Chinese place. It was very interesting. I thought it went well with the scallops. <br><br>For our second course, we ordered the Faroe Island salmon and the Berkshire pork cheeks. The salmon came sitting on top of a sweet potato sauce with a side of three little seafood dumplings (without the dumpling skins that I'm used to at Chinese dim sum places), a broccoli hash, and a few sweet potato chips. I really like the salmon (it was cooked just right) and the sweet potato sauce, but I wasn't too fond of the dumpings nor the broccoli hash. I thought everything went well together, but the dumplings and broccoli hash were a little boring for me. The pork cheeks were a little bit more interesting. It came with a tiny brussel sprout slaw, chestnut sauce, and poached honey crisp apple in bite-size pieces. Everything went well together on this dish. My only complaint was that the pork cheeks itself was a little bit on the salty end. Eating a small piece of the pork cheeks together with the honey crisp apples solved my problem with the saltiness though. <br><br>For our third course, we each had the black cardamom carrot cake topped with an <br>orange sherbet and candied kumquat carrot salad. This was delicious, but I could do without the cream frosting. I really liked the candied kumquat, and I joked that I got my \"good luck\" just in time for the Chinese New Year--red and gold are good luck colors for the Chinese New Year (February 10th this year!), so Chinese people give out oranges and kumquats for good luck.<br><br>Boka is the first restaurant I visited during restaurant week (this year and past years) that I would love to return to in the future.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YENP1vYS3XErVyrOQtB6gA/348s.jpg", "caption": "Black cardamom carrot cake"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cTNVLuTH85xZr-sIQ8E3xQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Faroe Island salmon"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2MZbVrLwk62CN6u7mx6wPw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Berkshire pork cheeks"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Incredible food and ambience.

My date and I shared everything on their restaurant week menu and while the selections seemed great on paper, I was left in want of more. <br><br>Their mushroom soup was by far the most multi-dimensional soup I've ever had. It was a literal meal-in-a-bowl from pieces of bok choy, crisped chicken thigh confit, and sweet bbq-esque shallot marmalade for contrast. Another highlight was their salmon dish- well prepared with a nice sweet potato accompaniment. On the flip side, I didn't really care much for the scallops- sort of on the dry side as well as the pork cheeks were tough. Is is bad to say that the broccoli garnish was my favorite part? We also ordered their signature mac 'n cheese with truffles. It was a bit too muted even with a pile of shaved 'shrooms and I didn't feel the edamame added anything to the dish besides visual appeal.<br><br>Service was excellent and attentive.

The pork belly was good but made very differently from what I usually expect, but the way it was cooked made it seem less fatty and more healthy.

Cannot really taste the flavors. I also did not taste the alleged passion fruit liquor<br>- seared scallops: again, scallops were fresh but not very flavorful. Sauce was not memorable and complimentary of the scallops.<br>- grilled octopus: the unagi cube was off putting. I did like the water chestnut and thought it was a good juxtaposition. Not enough puree.<br><br>Main:<br>- Barramundi: fish itself was fine. They paired it with pigeon peas and date puree. I just did not like them together.<br>- trout: we honestly did not enjoy this dish. The homemade soy vinegar jelly was a good thought (acidic with seafood) but it was so concentrated that it overpowered everything.<br>- duck breast: nicely cooked to medium rare as preferred. Did not wow my friends though.<br>- pork cheek: prolly the best dish of the whole night. Potato puree went well with the tenderness and heartiness of the pork cheek while other ingredients all integrated nicely.  <br><br>Bottom line is, I appreciate the novelty and ingredients are indeed fresh and great quality.

I did not get the Michelin stuffiness that you sometimes get at other restaurants. I don't like that one bit. To start they give you delicious pretzel bread with housemade butter. For the first course I did the hamachi with grapefruit, it was delicate and the flavor palette was on point. The second I did the poached egg with squash. The dish didn't sound like it would blow my mind, but let me tell you, it did. It almost had a popcorn flavor to it, and tasted like it had crispy quinoa in it - Ahhh-mazing! For the entree course I chose the Arctic Char because that is what our server had suggested. It was by far the most well cooked Arctic Char I have ever had (beat out Longman & Eagle, sorry Longman, you know I love you).

 Anywhoo...<br><br>We checked in with our reservation made on Open Table, our coats were taken, and we were sat right away.  After a decent drive from the suburbs, I wanted to empty my bladder and wash up before our meal.  I was able to wash my hands with the L'occtaine soap provided in the bathroom.  Ooh we fancy now!  You bet I made a pit stop back in on our way out to take advantage of some nice soap, towels, and lotion. <br><br>We began by ordering a couple drinks, and browsing the menu.  While doing so, our server brought over some salted bread for us to start with.  We both ended up going with the Restaurant Week Menu, even though our eye was caught by a number of things on their regular menu, but we'll be back for those another day.<br><br>*The Wild Mushroom soup was delightful.  Within the soup were a couple pieces of bok choy, confit chicken thigh meat, and a Parmesan crisp.  I had expected the soup to have a thicker consistency, maybe with some mushrooms floating around, rather than blended so immaculately.  I wouldn't say it was filling, but it was appetizing.<br><br>*The Diver Scallops were cooked to perfection.  After one bite, realizing they wouldn't be there very long, I had wished we had more.  They were seared and sat atop some creamy bamboo rice with spinach.<br><br>*The Faroe Island Salmon was cooked nicely, to about medium.  There is nothing is worse than over cooked tuna or salmon.  A scrumptious sauce, made from sweet potato, was nicely spread below the fish.  The salmon was served with a broccoli hash that I found unimpressive.  The hash just tasted of steamed broccoli that had been chopped up.  Go with a different side if you choose the salmon.  And I could of gone without the seafood dumpling on the side.  The dumplings tasted like the cooked white slime you wipe away from your crab legs.  Hey, I still ate two of the three to make sure how I really felt about them, so I can say they were edible, just not my cup of tea.  As for the chips that also were served on side of the salmon, they tasted very similar to Terra vegetable chips.<br><br>*The Berkshire Pork Cheeks were delicious!  Unfortunately, the pork cheeks were not my choice for the main entree, so this posed a problem.  I had gone with the Salmon, in an attempt to be \"healthy\", and was quickly regretting that decision after a taste of the cheeks.  Although it was not my entree, that didn't stop me from sneaking bites here and there off my guy's plate!  After one taste of his, I was wishing we could trade.  The meat was flavorful and moist, served with a chestnut sauce, and a brussel sprout slaw.<br><br>*We also added on the Mac 'n cheese, which used a homemade pasta, with edamame, and was topped off with a mound of freshly shaved black truffle.  Now when I say a mound, I mean a MOUND.  They are not skimping on that black truffle here. <br><br>*For dessert, we had the Black Cardamom Carrot Cake.  It was light and refreshing, topped off with a orange sherbet.  There were no other choices for dessert on the Restaurant Week menu, although they did have many others on their regular menu that I would like to go back and try.<br><br>My only complaint is how close the tables along the walls of the dining area are to one another, although this is a common problem I find amongst many Chicago city restaurants.  On the positive side of that, I get to scope out some dishes up close before ordering!  I could tell the two girls, sitting to the right of us, enjoyed food as much as I do, by their discussion on what they were tasting, and their cameras in hand.  I was happy to be sat next to two appreciative foodies like myself.  On the other side, a man a woman were sat halfway through our meal, and the whiny lady was more concerned with others around her than her own meal and company.  At one point, I could overhear the woman complaining about how the two girls I mentioned before, which mind you were two tables over from them, were figuring out how they were paying for the bill, commenting that they couldn't do math, which was not the case.  I mean, they were Asian, c'mon!  Why she cared?

Chicago has so many great and intriguing restaurants that it seems like every time I cross one off my list I find two more I want to try; while I have appreciated many restaurants only a small handful have been so phenomenal that I have desired to be a regular, but Boka definitely fits the bill.<br><br>Boka instantly made a positive impression with highly attentive service; we were warmly welcomed as we entered the door and they acknowledged a request we had made via Open Table on our reservation. We commenced our dinner with cocktails; the Weston - Bourbon with Pipe Tobacco essence and coffee has to be one of the best beverages I have tasted (and even rivaled a similar cocktail I regularly order at Grant Achatz' The Officer). Our primary server (Steven) soon greeted us and reviewed the menu; we were happy to learn that they have tasting menus (four course at $65 and six course at $85) that they customize based on your food preferences. I strongly urge you to opt for the tasting menu; the food here is top notch and it is best to sample as much as you can and draw the dining experience out. Do not be shy; at Boka they truly aims to please and listens to your preferences and customize the tasting menu to fit you to a tee.<br><br>We wound up being served seven courses plus bread service (a sour dough Focaccia), an intermezzo and the most fabulous assortment of Mignardises imaginable (though surprisingly no amuse bouche). The meal began with a Bento Box elegantly presented with a tasting of all four of their raw items. Each was delicious but the Red Snapper Carpaccio stole the show. Steven listened intently to our dietary preferences and each of the seven courses were completely tailored to our preferences. While I am open to eating just about everything, my wife is somewhat picky which makes tasting menus a challenge, but Boka worked it out perfectly. The second course (soft shell crab with a gazpacho sauce was as good as the first appetizer). The first entree was a generous portion of skate wing in a popcorn sauce with crayfish and the tastiest slice of andouille sausage I have ever had (and this coming from someone who spent four years residing in N'awlins).  Next we were served an expertly prepared piece of pork belly that was slow cooked so that it was actually lean and had the texture of short rib and was accompanied by a scallop, eel and hearts of palm; my wife actually thought the server had made an error in stating it was pork belly as it was so different (and better) than any other pork belly we had ever tasted.  The final savory was a  piece of steak, short rib and sweet potato; this was not my favorite course of the night, but still very good.<br><br>Steven had indicated that generally dessert includes a fruity selection and a chocolate based course, but my wife and I both love cheese courses and had requested cheese in lieu of the fruit based dessert. Steven gladly obliged and the cheese was nicely accompanied by what tasted like a gourmet fruit roll up, some jam and some nice bread and was the perfect transition to dessert - a chocolate cremeaux with potato chips and beer caramel (the caramel was phenomenal). This would have been a very satisfying end to a top notch meal, but before bringing the check a plate full of tantalizing Mignardises were delivered. Generally Mignardises seem to be an afterthought, but these were ridiculously good; there were two each of five different treats and not single dud. These alone were better than dessert at most restaurants. <br><br>Boka occupies a nice space; there is a bar area, the main dining room, an enclosed porch and outdoor patio. The ambiance is very modern and trendy and there is a nice energy without it being loud. Service is extremely polished, attentive and rather friendly; my only complaint would be that perhaps the servers are spread a bit thin and at times Steven seemed to have to cut conversation short to check in with another table. Nevertheless water glasses never became more than half empty, napkins were folded during bathroom trips, and we enjoyed a leisurely three hour meal where we neither felt rushed nor delayed. Our experience was so good that towards the end of the meal we actually booked a reservation for October and easily see this becoming one of a handful of venues where we dine at quarterly. Our six course tasting menu complete with a $70 bottle of wine and two cocktails each came to under $400 after tax and generous tip. While pricey, for what we received this was an excellent value. Boka is truly one of Chicago's jewels; great ambiance, service, menu, presentation, quality, creativity and experience.

My group got a little table tucked back into a corner of this dining room, which gave us the privacy we wanted.<br><br>The service and meal were excellent! We started off with cocktails. The server helped us each order something off the cocktail menu. I don't drink alcohol and I'm often disappointed with my non-alcoholic options, but the server helped us find the perfect thing for each of us. Mine had something with ginger and pomegranate and it was as delicious as promised.<br><br>For the first course I had the ricotta gnudi, which turned out to be similar to gnocchi but without the potato base. The ricotta sits on a light mushroom sauce mixed with raisins and hazelnuts. I loved it so much I might just order it again the next time I come here. For the main course I got the monkfish. Normally, I wouldn't have ordered this but the server said it was one of the best things on the menu. I was also intrigued because it is on a plate with braised beef cheek. I couldn't imagine how the two of those items would fit together, and so I went with it. Two thumbs up for creativity! The beef cheek flavor and the monkfish went really well together. My only problem with the entree was that a chunk of the beef cheek was more grisly than I would have liked. I don't mind a little fat on my meat, but in this case I felt like I was gnawing on flavorless cartilage. Anyway, it was a small portion of the entire entree but just enough to dampen my pleasure a bit.<br><br>Now, the best part of the meal was the dessert menu - without question! I had the chocolate cake, which turns out to be flourless dollops of intense chocolate next to cardamom ice cream. I think there were gingerbread sprinkles as well. I absolutely recommend this to anyone. The two other people in my group got different desserts though and each one of us agreed that they were amazing.

We were confused, as this was our first time dining, because we did not see ANYONE around us with this special treatment. It was, how can I put this, awesome. The soup was fennel-based, as mentioned, with a a liquidy/creamy consistency. There was some foie gras, duck meat, and apples in the soup. It was interestingly tasty, as this was a couple of our first times having foie gras. The apples really brought a new element to a one-sided-flavored soup.<br><br>Two of my fellow diners ordered a whitefish entree, while another the other and myself had the skirtloin. The whitefish was served with a prawn brandade and grilled fennel. It was cooked and flavored excellently. The skirtloin was served medium rare with braised cabbage and a sauce that pairs with the meat perfectly. We also ordered the mac n cheese with edamame. It was very cheesy and was phenomenal. In addition to our entrees and planned side, the chef sent a couple more surprises: a winter root vegetable medley, drizzled with a bourbon maple sauce, and cucumber salad.

The server was...I think not super amped about restaurant week. My friend was trying to decide between two entrees, and instead of offering guidance, the server smiled impatiently with her pen poised over her notepad in complete silence for like ten seconds. There were a few other awkward moments. It wasn't horribly offensive or anything, but my friends and I left with a vague sense of being tolerated. It's a great deal for restaurant week.

Bento box of 4 small dishes (oyster, snapper sashimi, hamachi sashimi, and tuna):  The dishes were all pretty good, although I have to say the flavors of the dishes aren't very authentic.  The ingredients used in the bento box are all very Japanese however the flavor is a bit too aggressive for Japanese dishes.  Perhaps the chef was trying to add his own style and twist to Japanese cuisine but for us who eat a lot of Japanese food, the flavor is not subtle and delicate like Japanese food is supposed to be.  We find it a bit odd and confusing.  Not bad, just odd. :)<br><br>2. Celery root soup:  The soup was really good, my favorite dish of the night other than the dessert. It's creamy but light.  Sometimes you only taste cream in these type of creamy soup but this dish actually has a lot of celeray favor to it!  Perfectly seasoned.<br><br>3. Rabbit confit:  I am not a huge fan of this dish.  The rabbit tastes like chicken to me.  But what really ruins it for me is the seasoning.  It's way overseasoned.  Too much salt.<br><br>4. Duck:  The duck was cooked perfectly.  Very tender.  Although lacking some surprise factor, it's a solid dish.<br><br>5. Venison:  I actually don't remember much about this dish.  Perhaps I am getting really buzzed after 1 cocktail and 2 glasses of wine?<br><br>6.

Sure, it was fine. But not $38 fine. It came with a little bit of curried butternut sauce (meh) and lentils (room temperature and totally ordinary). <br><br>CHOCOLATE GANACHE: Easily the best dish of the night, and I don't even care much for dessert. Yummy ganache served with crumbled flourless chocolate cake and horchata ice cream in a dulce de leche sauce. No complaints on this one.<br><br>I didn't eat a thing at Boka that was bad. But it was just an alright meal... I feel like the flavors were far too safe. I am learning that I tend to most enjoy restaurants that are all about their food and whose passion for the food seeps through. At Boka, it wasn't all about the food; it was about the floof and image (which were notably well-executed).

I had the \"Trade Secret,\" a gin based cocktail--very refreshing!<br><br>The food here is, maybe, what I would describe as being somewhat unusual. Lots of ingredients (too many? you decide) with some head scratching accompaniments.  We began with raw oysters from their \"Raw Menu.\" They were very small, but I suppose at a price of $3 each, they were fairly priced. In any case, they seemed to me to be nothing special. I also ordered the sesame crusted scallop appetizer. It was very good, although maybe somewhat too much salt. For an entree, I had the Atlantic salmon--and it was superb! My companions thought that their entrees were very good too. For the table, we tried the truffled \"mac & cheese\" and we all thought it was great, although you have to eat it fast, as it loses its charm rather fast as it cools.<br><br>They have a very nice selection of unusual desserts as well. We ordered a couple for the table and shared.<br><br>Service:<br>Very good. From the time we stepped in their door (through the somewhat confusing entrance on the south side of the restaurant) until we left, everyone from hostess, to bus boy, to waiter, were almost perfect--friendly, efficient, and helpful. Our waiter answered all our questions and was so helpful that, even though he forgot our mac & cheese dish until we reminded him, I have to give him a 5 out of 5.  Water glasses where refilled, excellent bread and butter replenished, and the food runners knew who ordered what.<br><br>To us, portions seemed perfectly sized.<br><br>Atmosphere:<br>We ate outside in their back garden area, as it was a perfect autumn evening. When I asked, they provided me with a flashlight/magnifying glass to help me read the menu (I was kind of out of the light, although when my eyes adjusted I had no problem). The main dining room was very nice, with soaring fabric \"sails\" across the ceiling, which will attenuate the noise level inside when it gets crowded. (I am fed up with certain Chicago restaurants that seem to think that elevating the noise level somehow elevates their cuisine. Do you hear me, goat girl?)<br><br>Parking:<br>Forget it! These few blocks of Halsted are impossible to park, and, of course, all the rich people who live in the side streets have made sure that their alderman has posted permit parking only signs all over the place (I live in Chicago--just how much do I pay to keep those very same streets that I can't park on repaired and plowed in the winter? Where's my damn \"permit parking\" rebate? Huh?). <br><br>Of course Boka has valet parking.

So goodd!<br><br>4) Fourth Entree- Dulce de Leche ice cream over a yellow, crumbled cake. Delishness! Ice cream was definitely a keeper. <br><br>5) Surprise Entree- Since it was the bf's birthday, the waiter was kind enough to gift a SECOND dessert.

This was imaginative, well-seasoned, well-thought-out cuisine that was perfectly executed and perfectly balanced.<br><br>First course was a raw sampler. The hamachi was a bit bland and had this weirdly-textured crunchy thing on it. I was a bit nonplussed by that, but it was one of four things on the dish, and the other three were impeccable. The hamachi wasn't bad. It just wasn't the best thing on that plate. The whipped avocado on the yellow fin tuna was awesome, and the tuna itself was by far the star of this dish (as it should have been). It was a fantastic sort of pre-appetizer.<br><br>Second course was an Heirloom tomato carpaccio that came with compressed watermelon. It had pumpernickel chips on it, which automatically made it a home run in my book. The flavors were complex, the texture was perfect, and the heirloom tomatoes were absolutely delicious. A surprising star in this dish were the pistachios. They looked like little pieces of corn, but they most definitely tasted like pistachios. Huge flavor improvement, and it gave a crunch to the dish that just rounded out the texture perfectly. A big winner, but at this point we were getting concerned that our request for a foie gras appetizer had gone unheard.<br><br>That is, until the third course came. Foie gras over strawberry quickbread and orange blossom yogurt. This was honestly the best thing I had ever put in my mouth. Hands-down. This kicks the crap out of anything on the menu at Takashi. There was a slight char on the foie gras, which was cooked absolutely stunningly. I wanted to eat three more courses of just this dish. It was absolutely superb.<br><br>Finally, the main course... When we were discussing this with our waiter, I had mentioned a bit of an aversion to eating brains. They had a striploin with chantrelles, heirloom tomatoes, \"borage flan\" (more later on that), and crispy veal brain. I honestly was hoping we got any entree except this one. Our waiter took a leap of faith. Despite me telling him I wasn't really feeling the brain, I was served up a striploin with a big chunk of breaded veal brain.<br><br>And it was absolutely stunning. The striploin was cooked amazingly, with a range from medium rare on the edge pieces to a perfect rare in the middle. It's exactly how a striploin should be cooked, and it seemed like it was cooked sous-vide. Then there's the issue of this \"borage flan.\" I had never heard someone use the word \"flan\" as a verb... As in \"flanned\" or \"to make into a flan.\" Borage flan was just that... A flan made out of borage, or starflower. I'll admit it was a bit bitter, and when tasted alone, it wasn't really palatable. But when mixed together into the so-called \"perfect bite,\" there was nothing else I would have rather had on that plate.<br><br>The desserts were spectacular (All three of them). First off, we weren't even sure if we were getting dessert. Our four courses were up, but the silverware changes just kept happening. Each time we thought we were finally done, another plate came out. The home run winner was the cream cheese sorbet on a corn cake. It was out of this world good. In all, across the three dessert courses, we ended up with three gonnelles of awesome types of sorbets, a brownie, a cookie, some chocolate pieces, and these little gelatinous things that tasted like lavender (buyer beware: don't eat these by themselves or else you'll end up with a mouth full of perfumey flavor, but they go delightfully with the sorbet). If you see a dessert duo on the menu when you go there, don't miss this. It was stunning.<br><br>All in all, I can't say enough good things about this meal. It was truly memorable in so many ways. The service was impeccable, but a bit slow between courses. Nothing that would detract from a 100% positive review.<br><br>The table next to us was full of some loud, obnoxious douchebags with this drunk woman who kept yelling \"Are you serious?\" at the top of her lungs. Her companion was wearing shorts. \"Are you serious?!?!\"<br><br>Boka, you got me. I'll be back, probably over and over. You gave me the best meal of my life, and I can't wait to see what else you've got.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Well... I made a reservation at Boka for my girlfriend and I on our July 4th trip to Chicago. I had been looking at some Michelin star rating, because I've always had exceptional experiences with basically any Michelin starred restaurant. However, this was an underwhelming culinary experience. The decor and ambience was very pleasant, and a perfect scene for a nice date. The service was spot on, and our waiter was very attentive and knowledgable. We ordered the 7 course tasting menu and I also did the wine pairing. The wine pairing was very nice. Each wine had its own character and the pairing was obviously well thought out with each course. However, the food was just very subpar. Each dish was very forgettable and none of the flavors were really all that exciting. It felt that each dish was either over salted or bland or just unexciting. I recall that we started with frog legs. While I only had one leg in my stew, my girlfriend had at least 4. The dish was followed by an asparagus platter that really wasn't anything worthy of a tasting menu. Followed by 5 more mediocre platters. The dessert was a little more composed but still nothing to write home about. Personally, I would much rather have 3 courses that are fully composed with complex flavors, instead of 7 dishes that really didn't feel fully composed or thought through. Overall, it's a nice experience. The service was worthy of 5 stars, and basically everything except the food was excellent. The food didn't feel Michelin worthy and spending $400 on tasting menus for two should have been a more impressive culinary experience.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Boka continues to be our favorite restaurant in the city.

However, my recent birthday dinner is without a doubt the best dinner I have ever had. Maybe one day I will get to go to Alinea next door, but until then, Boka is fine by me.<br><br>My friend and I had the 9 course tasting menu, which runs $115/person. Each dish was absolutely beautiful to look at. Portions were on the smaller side, but not so small that I couldn't finish my last meat course and was almost uncomfortably full at the end. Almost. I still managed to eat the amazing dessert that thoughtfully had \"Happy Birthday\" written across the top of the plate.<br><br>The menu changes so often and the chef loves to send out complimentary courses of something made special just for that day. So chances are, if I get into detail about specific dishes, they won't be available. But, there is definitely a heavy hand with the seafood. And it is always amazing. I have never eaten octopus before, but I promised myself I was going to try everything and my first foray into the creepy looking thing was actually delicious. It was grilled and served with a kumquat and fennel salad. Boka also likes to do foams. One of the courses during Restaurant Week was a perfectly cooked piece of white fish with a bone marrow foam. And for birthday dinner, I had a seared diver scallop with asparagus and bacon foam that was off the charts.<br><br>Every dish is fancy and has exotic ingredients that you may have never tried before, yet it's still approachable. Does that make sense? I mean, who doesn't love mac & cheese with edamame and truffled bread crumbs. Get this! It's their signature side and I have to order it every time I am there. And I have had braised short rib two different ways and both times were perfect.<br><br>This is definitely a romantic spot. The outdoor patio, the entryway, the bar and the main dining room are all beautiful. My one and only complaint is the side dining room. The looks like it used to be a beer garden but was now turned into some kind of gothic barn dining room. It's hideous and needs a makeover stat.<br> <br>So, my advice is to ask to be seated in the main dining room when booking your reservation. And then prepare yourself for an amazing meal. Their new chef de cuisine Carl that has been over seeing things while Giuseppe is busy making GT Oyster Bar fabulous is really a rockstar.

We had reservations at 9:30pm but didn't get seated until about 9:50pm. They thought we had reserved for more people. So we waited at the bar and had a drink until we had to double check with them to figure out when we'd be seated. That's when they realized their mistake.<br><br>To start with, I had a glass of 2007 Larochette-Manciat Macon-Charnay Chardonnay. It was delicate and very slightly sweet and not dry. I thought it was a pretty good glass of wine and decided to stick with it through the night when the waiter told me that didn't do any specific wine pairings with the different courses.<br><br>For the first course, I had the Eel and shrimp terrine with hearts of palm and grapefruit salad (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpinterest.com%2Fpin%2F252483122829337265%2F&s=e07e06466247c830116490035c5a76281e8b738db20a79ee4c86130f3fb76489\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">pinterest.com/pin/252483…</a>). This was really good and the eel didn't overpower the rest of the course like it normally does for me. The little portions of grapefruit (and I mean little, there was maybe about 4 small pieces of them) was a refreshing taste to finish the bites off with.<br><br>For the second course, I went with the Herb crusted whitefish with black truffle, brussel and prawn slaw, sweet potato, and chestnut jus (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpinterest.com%2Fpin%2F252483122829337266%2F&s=086a309c1fd48f5524046ada8c3e7fb855439f9c3ada08494d3a37263db870e3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">pinterest.com/pin/252483…</a>). I also added the fois gras. When they brought out this fish, the smell of the herbs made my mouth water. Unfortunately, the fish itself didn't have that much taste (it is, of course, still whitefish). I mean it was a perfectly cooked fished, I just wished there was more seasoning to it and for the herbs to add more flavor. The brussels and prawn were very good though, and the black truffle was fantastic. I used up all that truffle for the fish. And I'm very glad I added the fois gras because that was my favorite part of the second course. It was like buttery heaven. In hindsight, I should have just ordered a big serving of that :).<br><br>For the last course, there was only one choice - <br>chocolate praline terrine with Hazelnut ice cream, coffee foam, with candied hazelnut. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to grab a picture; I quickly ate the dish because I got too eager to taste it. It was an excellent dessert. I love hazelnut and I LOVE ice cream - combining hazelnut ice cream with candied hazelnut? Perfect.<br><br>I'd like to go back to Boka again. I saw a few things on the menu that I'd like to try.

I have been growing disenchanted with Restaurant Week in Chicago as it seems to now have restaurants participating in the promotion that have no interest in actually participating in the promotion--resulting in poor service from the front of the house and servers stuck in the middle either not happy with reduced tips or getting slammed by the restaurant's desire to pack in as many tables as possible for maximum profits. Boka, however, handles Restaurant Week perfectly, with no change in the quality of service from the front of the house, servers not overworked due to overbooking, and no sacrifices made to the quality of the meal.<br><br>Important Disclaimer: never trust a Yelp review that reviews the restaurant during Restaurant Week as the results are not reliable for any other time of year. Negative reviews will often ignore the fact that the restaurant was swamped with people trying to take advantage of the deals and that's why the service was rushed. Positive reviews often fail to take into account the real price of a restaurant, or are written by Yelpers dining out of their usual element. And now back to our regularly scheduled review.<br><br>My boo and I started with the oysters. The oysters themselves were obviously of top quality, but they were topped with a foam that my boo and I found disagreeable. The foam would be perfect if you were only eating one oyster, but the more oysters you ate, the worse the foam got. The foam was sweet and reminiscent of Key Lime pie, an interesting taste at first bite, but a cloyingly sweet oyster? No thanks. If you try the oysters, just get a couple or knock the foam out of there yourself and eat the oyster goodness underneath.<br><br>The rest of our meal was quite delicious. The Waygu beef ravioli was perfect and tasty in every way. Boka does sauces perfectly, although maybe a bit over reliant on foams, I can't really complain because the balance of flavors was great. The dessert was also phenomenal. I don't know what fancy french name they gave it, but it tasted like a decadent version of those crackly candy bars we loved as children. I immediately wished I could have a second.<br><br>One thing I'd also like to rave about Boka is the ambiance. It's a great date spot. The decor is perfect and the tables are spaced out so you can actually have an intimate dinner with your love without having other dinners slammed on top of you. Boka was such a pleasant change of pace from the communal eating trend and other trendy spots which feel the need to pack diners on top of each other to squeeze out some extra bucks. My boo and I were definitely fans of the Boka restaurant space itself. Job well done.<br><br>After our first visit, my boo and I definitely plan on returning to Boka.

He invited us out on his firm's tab, so none of us were really paying with our own money. Additionally, he'd informed the staff that he was considering hosting an event there once we were seated, and this clearly resulted in some special treatment (namely a few more free samples in addition to what we ordered). That being said, we spoke to other patrons around us who certainly weren't in our positions, and they were all as pleased with the place as we were. And after watching the staff interact with others at the restaurant, I'm convinced we would have been treated the same regardless (minus the free food).<br><br>Now on to the good stuff. Between the 3 of us, we ordered:<br>- 3 Cougar Magnum cocktails<br>- 2 raw items (tuna and hamachi/yellowtail)<br>- 2 appetizers (the squid and the baby octopus)<br>- 3 mains (the salmon, the halibut, and the lamb)<br>- 1 side (mac and cheese w/ edamame)<br>- 3 desserts (flourless chocolate cake, blueberries with cornbread and cream cheese gelato, and raspberry sorbet)<br><br>We were additionally served the panna cotta and the creme brulee dessert (complimentary). <br><br>The bill? $300 after tax & gratuity. <br><br>The portions are of course small as you would expect at an upscale new american place like this - but we LOVED every single thing we ate.

Let me explain. For the company Boka keeps among fine dining restaurants in Chicago, the execution of the cuisine was underwhelming and worthy of only three stars, and the service, or lack thereof, detracted from our overall dining experience to the point where I felt compelled to remove an additional star.  <br><br>For the starter I ordered the asparagus terrine which was probably the best composed dish of the night. For the main I went with the herb crusted whitefish. This dish lacked finesse. The celery root puree added little to the dish and the black garlic polenta had an unpleasant wet bread texture against what was a nicely cooked piece of fish. Moving to dessert we were served the flourless chocolate cake which was decadent, but \"safe\" and not very inspired. I'm usually the last person to complain about portion size; I'm a firm believer in the quality, not the quantity of the product, but without the bread service, I would have gone home hungry. <br><br>It was quickly apparent that our waiter lacked the experience you would expect in this type of establishment. After being seated and ordering our wine we were left for nearly twenty minutes before he returned to take our order, never walking us through the menu, asking us if we had questions, or engaging us in any other way, and then just disappeared. It wasn't until after returning home and checking Yelp that I realized that in many cases servers  either brought complimentary, or suggested augmenting the tasting menu, with the popular edamame  mac n' cheese -- we were never given the option. Nor were we asked if we would like a second glass of wine or a beverage with dessert.<br><br>Perhaps the strategy was to quickly turn our table, but at 10:00pm, I doubt this was the case.

We were given each a chocolate praline terrine with hazelnut ice cream, coffee foam, candied hazelnuts. Oh my, it was so good.

We stayed there for 5 hours- probably 2 of those hours were just talking. And we never felt rushed or unwanted like we overextended our welcome.

The scallops were divine, as well. They gave us all a little amuse-bouche of this broccoli/nutty soup--- so good. My dad said he was trying to lick the tiny bowl/cup--- this should be a full hot starter item. The simple complexity of the desserts is a nod to the ability of pastry chef Genie Kwon.

Deserves all the acclaim it's been getting after Wolen's first year.<br><br>I've been here 3 times, twice under Wolen, and I will say that the only disappointment I've experienced here was the most recent time, a few weeks ago, strictly with regard to dessert. There's a new pastry chef and I'm sure it'll take her some time to get some momentum going, but unfortunately I had the impression of being the guinea pig for a couple of desserts that need some work. The chocolate mousse, for one, just didn't do it for me; the many chocolate components ran together and the texture came off as dry and gritty. The cheese plate (Kentucky Rose), however, was the real flat note. I love that composed cheese plates are becoming more popular for dessert, but this one was just not right. The first problem was not nearly enough cheese on the plate, it couldn't have been more than half an ounce. The second problem was the cheese not being in its best state, which I think might actually have something to do with the fact that this cheese, I believe, is now made with veggie rennet. But I also didn't like that it was shaved so finely, the taste of plastic dominated. Thirdly, I didn't think that the accompaniments worked. The green tomato was too acidic for the cheese, and the pecan cake had no flavor or seasoning for me. <br><br>This won't keep me from coming back to see where pastry is in a few months, since I know Wolen's cuisine is going to be worth it.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This past summer my girlfriend and I made it a plan to visit as many Michelin rated restaurants as we could visit.

We ended up visiting the restaurant a Friday evening. We opted to take on the tasting menu with the wine pairing. The service was unbelievable and the knowledge of the staff was amazing. Every single course that we had was an explosion of flavors all coming together with an amazing wine pairing. <br><br>We have consistently recommended BOKA to everyone that is looking for a special dinner in Chicago. We plan on going back very soon, and are looking forward to an amazing dining experience.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Boka was on our Bucket List of Chicago Restaurants but we had been waiting until after they reopened from their total remodel/re-menu, so please keep in mind I am not comparing it to what it was previously.  I had read about the restaurant prior to their changing things and based on Yelp reviews really wanted to try it, but then the hype about all the changes really made us want to make it our first stop in 2015.  <br>I cannot say enough positive things about our experience!  The service from the valets to wait staff was outstanding.  I felt very welcome and comfortable from the moment we arrived.  Not knowing what it looked like in there before I had no expectation but I had read some very mixed reviews about the design.  I personally thought it was contemporary, eclectic, fun and classy.  I wasn't super sold on the fern/moss covered walls, but we didn't sit in that room so I didn't spend much time thinking about it.  <br>We tried quite a few of the appetizers and every single one of them was plated beautifully, but edible. Nothing too fancy or trendy, but plated with care about the presentation.  We tried the Nantucket Bay Scallops which were served chilled and were delicious!  I was a little hesitant with these suckers because I'm not a fan of crudo, but they were outstanding!  I don't think I can make a choice as to which was better, the Heirloom Carrots or the Foie Gras.  They were both savory with wonderful textures and I found myself thinking about them days later! <br>My husband and friends ventured on to the Octopus, which is something I'm not a fan of, but I tried it and found the flavor to be quite good.  I am more of a soup fan and also a huge fan of artichokes, so there was no question that I was getting the Jerusalem Artichoke Soup and I am so glad that I did!  If you love artichokes this is not to be missed!!!  It was the perfect amount of salt and savory flavors and just enough artichoke that you felt you were just eating melted hearts in butter.  I would go back all winter long just for this soup! <br>The highlight of the evening though was the duck that I ordered.  My only regret was that I was quite full from all my grazing on the appetizers and didn't feel I could truly enjoy this unbelievable dish.  So many times in watching some of our favorite food shows I hear a chef comment on the undeniable importance of cooking a piece of game like duck absolutely perfect and trust me, this dish was spot on!  The duck was tender, moist and juicy and seasoned perfectly.  Everyone at the table, who was loving their own dishes, kept finding themselves drawn to my plate and coming back for bites.  I highly recommend the Roasted Duck if you can get there while this is still on the menu.  <br>We also tried the Short Rib, the Venison and the Monkfish, all of which were delicious, but I will say that the least favorite was the Monkfish.  It seemed to grow on us after a few bites, but overall I found it to be a little bit strange as it's a very light fish that is set in thick white and creamy sauce.  Though both were delicious they seemed to not go together and we kept feeling like something was missing from the dish.  Again, it wasn't terrible, just not a favorite.  Both the short rib and the Venison were cooked to perfection too!  <br>The desserts were also outstanding, but to be honest I was completely overwhelmed by the end of the night by so many wonderful flavors and the whole experience that I couldn't even tell you my detailed thoughts on them!  I was truly appreciative though of the after dinner drink menu that included some wonderful coffee and tea selections.  Oh, and lest I forget, the pre-dinner cocktails at the bar were fun and delicious too! <br><br>Overa,ll I have to give Boka 5 stars and I am really rooting for this restaurant to have as much success as it has in the past and more.  Lee Wolen, Rob Katz, and Kevin Boehm are so deserving of a Michelin Star and I hope to see them acquire another in 2016!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I'm giving this place three stars because I don't think it's a good pre-Steppenwolf restaurant. Maybe a special occasion restaurant because it's very fancy and pricey. <br><br>I went here with my parents on a recent visit home before my mom and I went to see Tracy Letts' new play, Superior Donuts. (The play gets 4.5 stars!) I don't think we were expecting a super-fancy dining experience before the play but that's what Boka is: teeny amounts of food for astronomical prices. <br><br>My dad ordered the \"vegetable tart\" for $27 as his main meal. I took a photo of it b/c it was the most ridiculous looking dish I've ever seen, literally sprayed with hot pink beet foam. FOAM. Okay. I felt bad for my dad because the plate barely had any food on it but was still as expensive as meat dishes. <br><br>I ordered the quail appetizer as my main meal, and some black rice as a side dish. I actually really liked my quail. It claimed to be dusted with chamomile powder and it was!! Glops of grey fennel puree looked nasty but tasted great, and there was some little potato ball. The quail itself was tender and good, and I took pity on my dad and gave him a leg. <br><br>The side dishes are where I found the restaurant to be generous and interesting--the rice filled me up, and my mom had a side of creamy spinach that was great. <br><br>She also ordered a tabbouleh salad, which was more comical than nutritional. The plate had a recessed rectangle the size of a deck of cards, and inside were three rows: chopped cucumber, and two of whatever grain goes into tabbouleh. I think there were like two crumbles of feta. You're supposed to mix it up yourself, DIY-style. Cute and artistic, but not filling at all.<br><br>We got wine but skipped dessert. <br><br>The other funny thing is that the waiters and waitresses here talk to you like they're your therapist. They ask you how you are and then stare with an empathetic, expecting expression until you answer them--it's kind of eerie and overly attentive in a weird way.

My party of 9 loved your attentiveness & well prepared dishes. <br>Starting off with their amazing pork belly with bay scallops and hearts of palm was the perfect choice. We didn't ask, but it was super sweet of Boka to dual plate our dish since my hubby and I were sharing. I wish I tried the Soft Shell Crab with grilled prawns too because it looked amazing! <br>For our main course, we had the Sweetbread crusted halibut and the Beef Tenderloin with braised short rib. Both were great dishes, but were lacking a bit of seasoning. Unfortunately, all the extras they put on the dish just didn't add anything or any flavor. Wish I could say differently. The dish was good, but not great. BUT on the other hand, their mac n' cheese edamame with a truffle crust is a must have side! DO IT..you will not regret it. It's rather tasty and who doesn't love mac n' cheese!<br>Now to the main event: my dessert! Oh my goodness..it could possibly be the best dessert I've ever eaten. This dessert consisted of ANGEL FOOD CAKE, WHIPPED GOAT CHEESE, BERRIES, PASSIONFRUIT CURD! The description doesn't do it justice, but just trust my judgement here. It was delicious.  Boke gave you only the very best part of the angel food cake followed by candied berries and delicious passionfruit sorbet.  It's got all my favorites in one: cake, fruit, and sorbet!

When we went, there was a simplistic pasta dish with homemade pasta, meatballs, and their own sauce. It was nice, the homemade pasta was very good, but they skimped on the sauce and the meatballs so the dish was a bit bland. It was like they really wanted you to get the fact that they made their pasta.<br><br>Our pork belly appetizer was excellent, but my pork entree (I know, I know, probably shouldn't have done pork and pork on my first visit) was a bit dry and tough.

Were we here for a private party? What was going on? Not a private party, just a slow night. That worked out well for us but I'll get to that part in a bit. My friend is a restaurant professional, so he guided us to some expert wine picks. Our head waiter concurred with his choices, so we began with some beautiful whites that were all rather crisp and lemony. I'd thought it a bit late in the season for such a wine but I was wrong. I guess they *are* the pros.<br><br>As we do, we ordered a bunch of plates with the intention of sharing them. Ever the only child, I plotted on devouring mine and nibbling on others. Ever my friends, they were on to me and made sure that my nefarious plans would not come to pass. I'm predicable! Gag. We started off with a few seafood dishes. What stuck out for me were the tuna, scallops, octopus and oysters. I was not expecting such seafood mastery, but Boka must have a direct line with Charlie or that Chicken of the Sea mermaid. Wow. Everything was super fresh, dazzling plated and expertly layered with flavor. We kept the gluttony going by ordering several of the same salad: the blood orange salad was the perfect combination of palate cleanser and appetizing meal. Again, expert. For my meal, I ordered the duck. I know we *planned* on communal sharing and the like, but I have perfected my only childness over the years. The duck/pasta was incredible. Each bite was more intoxicating than the last. I couldn't *possibly* share this. \"Hey, JT!\" \"Hmph??\" \"How's your food? Can I try some?\" scarfing as much as I can into my mouth \"Que?\" \"Your food. The duck. Here, try some of my beef.\" \"Oh, I don't eat beef. Thanks anyway.\" And, so it went.

Perfectly seared on the outside and the sauces were mouth watering. only 3 pieces though, I could have eaten about 15. My date got the arugula salad that was good as well, but I'm not much of a salad person, but still very tasty with unique compliments. <br><br>For our entrees, I got the Angus striploin. This was absolutely delicious. Thinly sliced, cooked to perfection with a perfectly pink center. The sauces again were amazing. Loved this dish, this is how steak should be eaten everyday. Again, wish I had more. Date got the herb encrusted whitefish that was extremely tasty as well. I kinda wish I could have eaten both mine and my dates entrees. We also shared the edamame mac and cheese, which had a beautiful and delicious crust on top that melted in your mouth. One of the best mac and cheese's I've ever eaten and that says a lot. <br><br>For dessert, this topped it off for me. We both got the Venezuelan flourless cake with ginger gelato. I had heard so much praise for this before that I thought there was no way it could live up to the hype. Well I was wrong. It was absolutely delicious. I would have licked my plate if I weren't in such a nice establishment. Good job to pastry chef Kady Yon. <br><br>Must add that we also got the create your own cocktail. We thought this was a great way to have drinks. You could tell them a flavor profile that you wanted (she chose cucumber, I chose sweet and sour) and a spirit you want and they make a cocktail for you. They were delicious to try but a little pricey ($12/cocktail). This, however, would be the same price you would pay for a bottle of wine so I thought it was a nice change. <br><br>Overall, I really enjoyed my experience and can see why this place won a Michelin Star. Wish I could afford to try the regular menu, but I hope to be back one day to do so. Only downfall was that portions could have been larger, but this was as expected.

Given the Michelin star, I couldn't have had higher expectations, which for the most part, were met and exceeded. <br><br>I must echo everyone's sentiments about the ambiance, which has just the right amount of swank. Thanks to global warming and the otherwise anomalous warm weather we are enjoying this week, we had the pleasure of eating outside on the restaurant's ~40 seat patio; very sparsely decorated and lit, with only a single tree as far as plants go. Very classy. <br><br>The food had its highs and lows, but the highs wound up winning by a long shot. The bread (housemade rosemary focaccia) is excellent, and gets extra points for whatever salt they used (which was very coarse and mild in its salinity) and for the fact that it's served by a waiter as opposed to in a basket. Always a nice touch at a fancy spot such as this. The first courses were probably the low point of the meal for me; tuna with wasabi and yuzu foam is well-executed, but iterations of this are available at most restaurants in the city. Stuffed squid is filled with sumptuous scallops and shrimp and tops some of the best spinach I've tasted, but the enveloping squid is somewhat rubbery. Duck confit with black garlic puree, however, is notably well-balanced. The main courses are uniformly excellent - seared trout with smoked vidalia puree and green lentils is subtle but well-executed. Pork cheek with stinging nettle risotto and daikon radish is an absolute home run; the risotto in particular may be the best I have had. My personal favorite at our table was the duo of lamb, which consists of a seared chop crusted in licoricy ouzo served with arancini of milk-poached lamb belly, and drizzled with the aforementioned garlic puree.  One of the more memorable bites I've had all year. We splurged on the edamame mac and cheese about which everyone raves; can't say I'm a huge fan of this, as it's kind of just very rich and creamy without much in the way of sharpness. Dessert put this meal over the edge. Sweet potato dauphins come with marshmallow, chocolate soup, and an array of other accompaniments; it seemed like hodgepodge at first, but all the components worked very nicely together. Olive oil cake with grapefruit sorbet and grapefruit segments is a perfect combination, and not that sweet, which I personally appreciate in my desserts. Of note, the desserts are small, palate-cleansing proportions, which wins Boka major points in my book.<br><br>Pricing is high, but fair for food of this caliber. You could spend this kind of money at several restaurants of markedly inferior caliber in this city. Portions seem small, but our table of athletic twenty-something dudes was all stuffed to the gill before dessert even came out, so you're not getting fleeced at all. Service is really good; glasses are never empty, and the waiters treat you personally and attentively while still allowing you to enjoy your meal and company.<br><br>Overall, I'm willing to overlook the few mediocre offerings I experienced, because so much else of what I had was so unique and spectacular. I'm not going to whine about the Chef's week menu offerings not appearing on the regular menu, as the overwhelming majority of them fit right in.

I've heard a lot of hype about it.. and a couple friends wanted to try it out - so I thought I would tag along for the ride. Apparently this restaurant has a Michelin star, so I had pretty high expectations.. Overall I wasn't extremely wowed but I was pleased with the dining experience.<br><br>Looking over the menu, I saw some things that caught my attention... Otherwise nothing was that extravagant when compared to other restaurants from the new-american genre of fine dining restaurants.  I will say that prior to my visit, I perused some of the pictures and was unimpressed by the 'air' i saw on some of the plates. I'm very turned off by these foams that are really dated. The interior of the restaurant is memorable.. ceiling drapes aren't seen very often. But in the end, they are just ceiling drapes. Comfy seats though. Service is good, nothing out of the ordinary. Although I'm glad that they're generous with their rosemary focaccia (tasty).<br><br>We all started off with their oyster appetizer..<br>Where do I begin?<br><br>The presentation was cute, I guess. The description was misleading though. I thought the taste was rather monotone and not very exciting. They stated that there was some sort of yuzu pearl/caviar but it lent very little acidity to the bite. When eating oysters I really need that jolt of something tart to really elevate the taste of the oyster. The oyster itself wasn't my particular favorite type either. It wasn't as sweet as other oysters I've had in the past such as kumamoto oysters. All in all: blah.<br><br>For my 2nd course, I tried the chicken thigh. It was good but again, not spectacular. I will however note that the highlight of that dish was the pickled celery root. That was really what carried the dish in my opinion. Otherwise you were served a plate with a small nugget of dark meat that was cooked well. Good seasoning, basic pan sauce. Thank goodness there wasn't any sort of foam on it haha. <br><br>My friend had the scallop which was tasty but I've definitely had better scallops elsewhere. I wish I could tell you what else was on that plate, but it wasn't really memorable.. <br>Our other friend had the salad which I didn't bother trying because, let's be real, a salad is a salad. You either do it well or poorly. The salad was passable from what I could tell. <br><br>Main course: I had the beef option (the others had the pork and seafood options)<br>Beef was tender and cooked perfectly. The taste was good. I really dug the puree that was served with it. It was really nutty and velvety. I liked this dish more than the others I had.<br>I also enjoyed my friend's pork belly. Now, I am a slut for dishes with pork belly but I thought I would try something else so we can all sample each other's plates. (I wish I went with my instinct and got the pork belly) Super tender and tasty. The oysters were a nice touch. I didnt care much for the green tea noodle cakes. I found them to be kind of dense and not that awe-inspiring.<br>My other friend had the seafood option which was some whitefish.. something something.... (if that's any indication of how that dish went)<br><br>DESSERT.<br>Now, I'm not generally a dessert person but when I'm presented with a good dessert, I'll indulge. I think that night's dessert is really what captivated me. I love kulfi and I really enjoyed the ginger kulfi with the dark chocolate espresso cake. It was flourless so it had a ganache/fudge consistency which was nice and the crumble provided that much needed saltiness to balance out the sweetness. and i applaud the feature of citrus fruits to add another level of dimension to that dish. kudos to the pastry chef!

I live in downtown Chicago and had been enjoying Chef Giuseppe's other venture, GT Fish & Oyster, and there is hardly a chance for me to make a trip out to the area so on such occasion I was very excited to finally visit Boka. The ambiance was great, however, the interior and simple decor gave it a good atmosphere - no question about it. My main server was very knowledgable about her recommendations. She was able to recommend a glass that was just exactly what I needed and answered my questions without fail. There is actually nothing to complain about her, she was hardworking, and attentive - it was rather her assistant servers that seem pretentious and \"unnatural\" in the way they carry themselves that I felt it made the whole place coming off as \"trying too hard\". I have been to a lot of Michelin starred places throughout Asia, Europe, and New York, and a couple is California, and downtown Chicago and I regret to say the ones of similar ranking out there offered much better food and service experience than Boka. <br><br>The biggest disappointment at Boka was the food: everything came too salty, the pork belly and the green sauce with bean sprouts (?) reminded me of street food in South east Asia which may be intentional but rather pleasantly surprising. What was unpleasant was the saltiness in every item I had. The scallops were salty at first but I endured until the soft shell crab came and after the 2nd or 3rd bite it was so salty I had to spit it out! I am not able to do that so discretely because the assistant servers were always walking up and down around the table looking at us even when there was actually nothing for them to do! I think the busser boy who poured me the green scallops soup seemed to have worked harder, I see him effectively actually DOING something (i.e. quickly cleaning up and setting up table) than just walking around in such an abrupt, startling and unnecessarily fast pace that the assistant servers were doing the whole time I was there. Now back to the salty food, I am not such a \"use-subtle-ingredients-not-salt\" snob but the amount of salt used in every plate I had was really off-putting. I think I must have eaten a lot of pure salt after that meal. Heavy salting to me is a sign of resorting to doing a lazy \"short-cut\" to bring food to taste -- I really wish the recipe please your tastebuds via different methods than relying on salt overusage like that! I told myself that there must be some accident in the kitchen- I cannot.. cannot.. imagine recipes with this much salt deserving Michelin stars! I try to believe that Chef Guiseppe did not intend this and there was a mistake. I felt sick and could not finish the meal and had to leave the delicious wine that my server recommended. My server \"Alexa\" was very polite about it however and helped me pack up the leftovers which my fiancé at home could not handle either, he also complained it was too oddly salty and we ended up having to throw the whole thing away. <br><br>Before I left the place, the 1 male host helped me call a cab but the 2 hostesses were reluctant to do that even though I approached the girls first as it is natural for me to feel more comfortable towards fellow females than males. I'm not sure if it was because they were not so quick and witty (didn't know what to do or how to respond when I asked them to help me call a cab) or just not naturally friendly and conversational? I cannot complain much on this small point as they really did nothing wrong but their nonresponsiveness made me feel I was talking to myself in those few moments and their characters were different than the hosts and hostesses I met at other Michelin starred restaurant which are expected to hire witty and conversational talents who can entertain guests and not just seat them. <br><br>Overall, I really wish I can \"re-review\" the experience (the seafood at low-key and rediculously inexpensive establishment King Crab Tavern nearby I visited prior to Boka was even better prepared!). I may try to come back with my fiancé to order different menu items and give Boka another chance as maybe that day I visited, Boka was just having a bad day that's why other reviews by other yelpers and the Michelin mystery shoppers are not consistent with my experience?

We went on a Friday at 7, and I was surprised by how empty it was -- only five or so tables were filled, and we had a booth area to ourselves. We started with cocktails -- a grapefruit one for him, a twist on a Manhattan for me -- recommended by our waitress, and they were both great. We did the six-course tasting and added the truffles they had available that evening. The amuse was a delicious crispy bite of Spanish mackerel over a ceviche with julienned veggies and some tuna maybe -- amazing way to start the night. The next course was bass with green tea noodles and a tofu beignet in a seafood broth -- perfect. Then we had grilled baby octopus with short rib, all in a korean sauce served with chermoula and tomatillo. I'd never had baby octopus before, and it was tasty, if just a little chewy, which is how I think octopus just is. Then we had pork served with smoked oyster mushrooms, garlic spinach, a rutabaga puree, and topped with the truffles. It was my first truffle experience (outside of oils, or tiny flecks), and everything together just sang. Such a great dish. It also included a little cannelloni filled with braised pork cheek, which was nice. Our final savory dish was tenderloin rubbed with fenugreek and served with lemon israeli couscous and an olive oil-based \"broken\" sauce. It was tasty and the beef was perfectly cooked. On another night, it would have been outstanding, but next to the other innovative dishes, it was simply flawlessly prepared meat -- which is the best insult I guess a dish could get. Dessert came in two courses: the first was a financier with farro ice cream, pieces of farro I think, and a raisin puree. It wasn't overly sweet, but there were little cubes of what may have been honey that added bursts of sweetness. It was nice. The final dish, though, was the way I'd prefer to end every meal; it was all chocolate, all the time. It consisted of a ganache part, chocolate crumbles, caramel sauce, a soft chocolate ribbon, and horchata ice cream. Aaaaamazing.

Then for our main courses, I had the short rib ravioli with the cucumber and strawberry side and boyfriend had the striploin with the mac n' cheese, edamame side. Oh. My. God. The ravioli was wonderful- flavorful and everything on the plate went together so well. And the cucumbers and strawberries were surprisingly delicious. Together they balanced either other out perfectly, but alone, it was the best strawberry I have ever tasted! The bf didn't love his striploin and I felt it was lacking a bit of flavor, but the mac n' cheese was really good. The mac n' cheese didn't come out with the rest of the food (only about 2 minutes after they set down our entrees) so they gave it to us on the house and also threw in a side of snap peas and bacon to make up for it. It was unnecessary but totally appreciated! To finish off the meal we ordered the chocolate cashew cake for dessert. It was...

Both of those had excellent flavor profiles, and I found myself eating sides for dinner rather than my actual dinner.

I had such an experience at Boka.<br><br>My boyfriend and I were on our first trip to Chicago. We wanted to savor the best the city had to offer, so, we immediately made ourselves reservations at Charlie Trotters. No doubt one of the best chefs and restauranteurs around, yet, we began to think, is this restaurant tired? Did we want to waste our one chance at somewhere that wasn't as \"hot\"? I reached out to some locals and got great recommendations, Ghrahm Elliot's, Blackbird, and Alinea were all possibilities. But it was the last minute suggestion of a New York native to try Boka. Without hesitation, we simply agreed. We had no pre-conceived notions, no images of the place, no reviews, nothing to set the tone for the evening.<br><br>We were first met by a hostess of pure joy. She seemed thrilled by nothing more than our decision to try their restaurant. We were promptly seated in the \"out door\" section of the restaurant. I happen to be a seating nazi and will ask to be moved for the smallest reason (I can see the bathroom, I'm by the cash register, I cant see outside, etc.) So being sat in a corner in the \"out door\" section would usually enrage me, but it was quiet, peaceful, warm, and inviting. Our waitress appeared and began the feeding process. We quickly learned she had a vast knowledge of not only the menu, but of food, wines, Chefs, and restaurants alike. We were impresses by her brain. And the eating began.<br>The bread basket selection was very charming. I am picky with breads and was thrilled that I got to select my own (perhaps I am a bit easily amused). We each ordered 3 courses apiece. The food was simply delectable. Each dish was balanced, fresh, and inventive. Some dishes were better than others, but the way they all married together was perfect. We were also presented with 3 additional side dishes, compliments of the Chef. Several times we were approached by managers checking on our enjoyment of the meal. For the finale we each ordered a dessert with a complementary wine to follow. A nice ice-wine and Sauternes finished the meal. After a lovely conversation with our waitress about food + life, we paid our bill. We weren't ready to leave yet though! So, we ventured into the bar to have even more love poured down out throats. We instantly bonded with the bartender, like old friends we regaled each other of stories of California, Batman, and In-N-Out burger all to the flavors of fantastic, hand crafted libations. <br>If we didn't have another engagement to meet, we would have never left. On our way out, the pure joy hostess expressed again her happiness and thankfulness that we dined with them that evening.

After dealing with some TOUGH faces in multiple states for a stretch...it was a nice start.\\r<br>\\r<br>We walked past the beautiful atrium seating and outside (too humid), and were seated in the tables near the now smokeless bar area. Beautiful rich colors, cushioned arm chairs and stylish menus. I was already impressed with the decor, at least.\\r<br>\\r<br>The menu was a simple one-page affair, but with some tremendous items -- some great appetizer choices, oysters and 5 differents 'numbered' salads (salad #1, et al.). Jacky ordered the scallops: grilled with a lavender cream sauce, chanterelles, leeks and organic popcorn garnish. Unique, and very well done. I started with a trio if their three oysters, served with a champagne mignonette, and 'salad #5' -- a prosciutto and melon salad with hazelnuts, greens and balsamic. Absolutely tremendous. The salad was the highlight. I also started with a nice chilled Grey Goose martini (extra dry, natch) with a skewer of excellent blue cheese stuffed olives. Their wine list was phenomenal, and Iwas looking forward to selecting a glass for dinner. We noted that they are one of the few restaurants in Chicago serving Hanzell Vineyards wine...a Sonoma favorite, you must try their Chardonnay or Pinot Noir (all they make). While pricy, it is perhaps our favorite vineyard in America (Jacky is a Sonoma Cutrer girl, though), and they have been doing it since the late '50s.\\r<br>\\r<br>I digress -- the entrees -- Jacky had been drinking it up for a late afternoon business thing at BIN36, so she had actually been noshing all afternoon, so she stopped at the scallops. I was torn between some great-looking selections -- a nice vegetable laden risotto, a halibut, a salmon...but I decided on a pork tenderloin, done in a BBQ dry rub served with braised swiss chard and a corn succotash. It sounded great, and it was indeed a tremendous dish. In fact -- my only complaint was that the chard was bit too 'musty,' rather than simply a bitter green. I think it needed an extra rinse (like spinach), prior to cooking.\\r<br>\\r<br>Jacky was, however, in a dessert mood, and we couldn't pass up some tasty options -- Jacky had a chocolate creme brulee served with tiny chocolate chip cookies, and I had a twist on my favorite dessert of all time (lemon meringue pie). It was a lemon tart topped with a meringue and covered in a warm blueberry compote. Both were great desserts.\\r<br>\\r<br>Our service was excellent -- we had a very knowledgable server, and at one point -- I wanted to get that glass of wine I was looking forward to (a nice Malbec), and while glancing for our server, the manager spotted me, and made a nice beeline for me to ask what I would like. I told him, and within 2 min., our server deftly delivered my glass.\\r<br>\\r<br>All in all -- an efficient (thinking theatre) dinner, replete with excellent service, a calming atmosphere, great food, and a menu that will make me come back to try other options.\\r<br>\\r<br>To conclude -- I am still shaking my head that we hadn't been here before, but now that we have, we'll be back for sure.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Wanted to love this place, but didn't.

Our waiter, Robbie, was the best and gave us very good suggestions that ended up being wonderfully delicious! After experiencing one of the worst waiters at Market for lunch, Robbie was exactly what we needed to forget all about it.<br><br>We started with a couple pieces of their house rosmary foccacia and it was exactly how I love my bread to be. It was soft, a little sticky, hard (but not too hard) of a crust, with really good flavor. The food started to roll in and because we were still pretty full from lunch we ordered 2 of the Restaurant Week menus instead of 3. The chef decided that we needed to have 3 dishes of scallops instead of the 2 because, as Robbie said, \"thats how we roll.\" I loved that the chef went above and beyond what he had to do for us. The diver scallops were amazing and melted in your mouth! The chef also gave us a cucumber salad that was so cool and refreshing, which was jsut what we needed to prep us for our entrees. We then had the herd crusted whitefish and the tenderloin for our entrees and they were both so flavorful! The shortribs literally fell apart in your mouth and you were just left with a smile on your face and a warm feeling of happiness in your tummy. I was not too sure about the \"sticky pudding\" for dessert, but it ended up completely blowing my mind. We just had ricotta cheesecake at Market that was not that great and weren't sure about ricotta ice cream... boy, were we wrong. 2 sticky puddings weren't enough! Robbie suggested the apple fritters and me not being an apple kinda gal I was skeptic. I seriously don't even know why I bother not trusting his suggestions because it was amazing! After a delicious meal, we rolled out of the place and are planning our next trip back! <br><br>I want to run outside and scream to everyone to go to Boka, it was amazing.

Since their menu changes so much, its hard to base a restaurant review on one dish but I have to. I'm sure that by today, the dish would have been removed and another one has taken its place. <br><br>We arrived for our Sat reservations except they had lost our reservations. We had called the day before. How do restaurants lose reservations? We waited 15-20 min for our table at their bar. The atmosphere of the restaurant is really nice and would have to agree that this would be a great date place. <br><br>After we got seated at our table and ordered, we didn't get any bread. We had to flag down the bread guy to give us some bread. I like to sometimes sprinkle a little sugar on my butter, but when I asked for sugar, I got equal, sweet and low and cubed sugar. I like how you get to pick out what type of bread you want. It reminded me of Frazoli's where the breadstick woman walked around with her basket.<br><br>We ordered the grilled octopus appetizer and the waiter was kind enough to split it for 2 people. It was good, but not that best I've had (best was at Spring). It was served in salad form with bbq eel, bacon, and other vegies. Around the plate was arugala with apples and yogurt/creme fraiche mixture with mussels. Besides the one mussel that had a lot of grit, it was good. <br><br>So I ordered the angus strip loin entree while my bf ordered the braised pork cheeks. My entree came deconstructed which with some dishes, I enjoy. Except this dish, I just didn't get. The angus strip loin was cooked well but I needed more flavor. There was rutabaga which i didn't particularly care for, along with a pile of mushroom schnitzel that just tasted like tiny deep fried flour to me. There was a separate piece of braised short rib that was exceptionally dry that I could not even eat it. The worst thing on the plate was the spinach flan. I love spinach, but it was tasteless as flan, and the texture didn't help. It was garnished with a big piece of bacon which couldn't even save the life of the spinach flan. I found the whole dish very disconnected, the flavors were very bland, and it left a lot to be desired. I also remember eggplant being on the menu with the dish, but maybe I'm mistaken. On the other hand, my bf loved his dish a lot. So I understand how Boka has gotten rave reviews. <br><br>A couple of other things that were distracting were the two tables next to us. One table was a big family that maybe knew the chef because the waiter kept giving them plates of food after plates of food saying \"compliments of the chef\". The table right next to ours was a guy and a girl who were friends with our waiter. They were also receiving complimentary food. Along with them being loud, they kept staring at our food (I mean hello I'm sitting not even a foot away from you) and commenting on it, followed with \"stop it! stop staring at their food\". I don't want to judge a restaurant by its guests so this review is solely based on the food. I do find it important that I add on what made my night less enjoyable as well. <br><br>Not sure if this place is worth coming back for.

Half my chile crusted salmon was cooked through, and the other half was raw...and there was no spice or chile or anything.  It was very bland and actually tasted dry.  The brussels sprouts and mac & cheese were both good, but nothing that made me change my mind about the meal.  I guess I would expect a small plate of food were it the best food around, but a small plate of food I could make better at home is not worth almost $100 per person.  Overall, we had a great waiter and I was there with my 2 best friends, so I had a good night.

We were there on a slow night, and that may have helped with the great service- we were never unattended, but not in an annoying hovering sort of way. The food was fantastic.

The pork belly was really tender, and the size of that appetizer was huge. The fish was amazing- SO fresh-it made me think they have a lake out back and that they go out fishing an hour before they make the meals,  or something.  The pasta was truly unique- I believe they said it was made from quail eggs- my memory is fuzzy- they had a great wine list, which we utilized well. I've only had pasta that good in Italy.

We sat on the patio and it is one of the most romantic and beautiful settings I've been in Chicago. Candles and trees everywhere. The service was wonderful and the food exceptional. The arugula salad was an explosion of different flavors as were the scallops. For an entree, I went with the white fish and my husband chose the short rib ravioli. Both were excellent, the fish was perfectly cooked and very light. We shared a side of mac n cheese with edemame which we both enjoyed. The portions are just right and not heavy at all. The dessert options looked good but we were too full and quite tired. It was a great experience and pretty reasonably priced for the quality and uniqueness of food and exceptional service. They have two wine lists, one very reasonable and a reserve one for those who want to spend much more. The only small negative about this place is that there aren't many options, I would say there were 7 entree choices but they do cover everything. (fish, beef, pork, chicken, veggie).

The staff and greeters are great and really welcoming.  The food was outstanding.  Had the duck with black cherry and cinnamon spaetzle  and I actually said to my husband that I walked in mildly liking duck and I will be walking out with duck as a fav.  So tender and flavorful and the combo of the savory duck with the cherry flavors in the spaetzle....  excellent.  I wanted to do 4 1/2 instead of 5 because they love to puree things and smear them on the plate to make them look good, while I would rather actually taste them..  For example, the arugula/pear salad had goat cheese pureed and drizzeled on the outside of the plate.  As it was it was  just ok, but if there was actual goat cheese in the salad in an amount you could taste it would have added alot to the bland salad I ate.  I also just generally like a menu with more options.  Overall though, I totally LOVED the food, service and atmosphere and will definitely be back.

We were on our way to a pub down the road for something to warm us from the rainy day. Good news for us...the pub changed its menu so we walked back to BOKA. We sat at the bar and got incredible service. The bartender was amazingly attentive and highly knowledgeable on both the food and drink. We ordered his two most recommended starters and main courses with a nice glass of rich red wine and a classic Knob Creek Manhattan. I drink Manhattans all the time and this was by far the best! He mixed a mean drink....not too sweet....not too dry. And it was ice cold which is a perfect contrast for the warming quality of the bourbon. The chef even threw in a third starter with his compliments! That never happens. But I am glad it did....delicious rare tuna and a quail egg. Everything on the menu is unique and complex without being stuffy or over seasoned. You'll find things like crispy pork tail with scallops, pork belly with sweet breads, amazing fish and veal dishes and some really unique deserts. The bread is pretty tasty too...house made focaccia and local made Italian wheat. My biggest recommendation is to strike up a good conversation with your server or bartender. Ask their favorites, be honest about what you like and don't like, and maybe stretch your palette a little, but definitely get things you love because the price isn't insane but it certainly isn't a cheap thrill....it's high quality....and you get what you pay for.

 I don't eat red meat so they had a vegetarian option to replace the dish with the beef.  The vegetarian option was very good but not as strong as the previous two courses.  Their dessert had a bizarre foam on it that I didn't care for, but it was still pretty good.  Overall, great service and delicious food and drinks.  The ambience was also very nice.  I reccommend the restaurant, but just be prepared to hang out at the bar for at least 15 minutes past your reservation time.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "In May, I went to Boka for the first time in about a year.  I have always thought the food was very good, though perhaps had grown a bit weaker in recent years.
