This is not my favorite type of crab but they were very good. Creamy and sweet, better than the ones I had in Florida. We also got a pound of Jumbo Alaskan King crab legs and the Dover Sole. Alaskan King is prob one of my faves (next to Dungeness), they were SO GOOD here. Really succulent and sweet. We finished the meal off with that famous key lime pie, mmmm so good.<br><br>By the way, if you've never had a pickle martini, they make a decent one here.

The shrimp were a bit over cooked and the lobster were a bit undercooked. The scallops were just right! The Mac and cheese side was super tasty but the seasonal cauliflower side was bland. My husband got a seafood pasta dish and he said it was good but he regretted not getting what I got.

I've been to the Las Vegas location in Caesars Palace many times, and always love it. 5 Stars. <br><br>Last night was my second trip to the Chicago location. It is just a good. Despite downtown Chicago being very quiet last night (10/31/17), Joe's was relatively busy, but not packed. I was by myself so had hoped to just get a spot at the bar, but every seat at the small bar was taken. There are seats at a counter along the exterior windows so I grabbed a seat there as there were several available. <br><br>Service was prompt. I ordered the Select size claws which is 6 claws in the pound. $49.99. If you are not familiar with stone crab, this price is fair. Same you would get at the original location in Miami. I have found a place here and there that does them for less like in Tampa, but it is few and far between you will find them for much less than $50 for a pound of decent sized claws. <br><br>As always they were cracked well, easy to eat, and with their awesome Joe's mustard sauce. If you like shellfish and have never had stone crab, you need to try them, and get them at Joe's to make sure you get an authentic experience. Also, make sure you get them between October 15th and May 15th. Outside of those dates the stone crab season is closed so you would be getting claws that had been frozen. Once frozen the meat gets stringy and very hard to pick clean off the claws.

(Side note, I wish the manager was also dressed as elegant as the rest of the staff was not in a gray suit) <br>Our waiter was Matt, a little dry on the humor and short with words but overall knowledgeable and kind. <br>To start had the crab cake appetizer. It's one crab cake but mostly crab no cake which is perfect. My entree was the Dover. Wow! Highly recommend anyone to get this dish. <br>They bring the whole fish and take off all the bones before they serve you it. Sides are all a la carte, the Brussels were one of the best I've had.

It's definitely your traditional, classy steakhouse (white linen tables, servers in tuxedos) so avoid casual wear as much as you can. My husband, parents and I came here this past Saturday (the beginning of Restaurant Week) and it was PACKED. Highly recommend you book a reservation, especially on the weekends. <br><br>We were seated and our server, Denise, came by and introduced herself and then proceeded to ask all of us what our names were. I can safely say that has NEVER been done before when I've dined at a restaurant. I thought that was so classy and respectful to ask our names; not to mention, she remembered them the rest of the night and addressed us all individually by our names. Claps for you, Denise! <br><br>The food was absolutely outstanding and I'm pretty sure we all rolled outta there afterward. My husband and I decided to go for their Restaurant Week menu of an 8 oz filet mignon (order it with a side of béarnaise sauce), grilled tomato (which was fabulous by the way - had pesto spinach and cheese on top of it), and mashed potatoes. We also added on mac and cheese and brussel sprouts, because why not? Everything was incredible and cooked to perfection. My father ordered the grilled branzino and my mother ordered the seafood platter. Needless to say, we were all stuffed by the end of our meal. <br><br>But....who goes to a steakhouse and leaves without trying dessert, am I right?! My husband's and my meal automatically came with a slice of pie (key lime for me, banana cream for him), so obviously my parents were a little jealous and decided to order some pie too. What's great is that Joe's does half slices of pie so you can try more than one. My parents each got a half slice of two different pies so they could get a taste of everything. Let's just say, half slices mean full slices to the people at Joe's. They were HUGE. I had my key lime pie and tried the banana cream and chocolate pies and I have to say the key lime knocked it out of the park. Probably the best I've ever had. That graham cracker crust though.....<br><br>Anyways, if you're looking for a nice steakhouse but aren't afraid to drop some serious ca$h money, make your way to Joe's!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "5 stars for the service from Bridget & Maggie.

Of course we ordered 2 because we don't like to share! <br><br>Oysters: there's 3 different sizes we got the smallest ones which was delicious. Especially with the ice vinaigrette. If you're afraid of raw oysters GIVE THIS ONE A TRY it's fresh and not fishy at all! <br><br>Crab stuffed shrimp: the crab meat was succulent and reminded me of crab cake. It was good but I would order this as an appetizer and share not as your dinner. <br><br>Alaskan King Crab: we ordered this 1.5 pound and I was in heaven!!! Soooo money! They cut it up for you table side. Only flaw was it was served cold not hot. Nevertheless it was delicious! <br><br>Everything is a la carte. We ordered a side of fried asparagus which was crispy on the outside and still tender inside. Very nice :)<br><br>Drum roll... and the finale was our incredible dessert.

Honestly, it's good but I don't think there has been anything out of the ordinary from your standard steakhouse.

But I just don't think it quite lives up to the hype-it's all about the hype for me don't give me false expectations with hard let downs-the worst! I digress. <br><br>Our reservations were for 9pm. We got seated about 20 minutes past. It was crazy packed on a Saturday. They announce your name over the mic when your table is ready. I love the ambiance. It's very classy with romantic lighting. Although there was a mix of people from dates to friends getting together so it's really for any occasion. The dress code is pretty fancy but if you're at least in business casual level you'll be good. I wouldn't recommend jeans unless with a fancier top and some heels. <br><br>The service was friendly. Nothing spectacular and quite honestly at some points-annoying. Our waiter was nice but when the man asked what kind of beers do you have we got the \"uhhh well uhhh we have Stella and uhhh corona\" there is nothing I hate more than getting the basics. If I'm asking you what kind of beers do you have I'm definitely looking past the basics to that of corona. There were points where I was trying to get the waiters attention and he was just blatantly making conversation with his fellow employees. I was ready to leave and  we could have left sooner if it wasn't for his distractions. <br>Annoying. But still friendly and pleasant. <br><br>The minimum to tip is 18%. I really only wanted to give this guy 10% but I just gave in because he was nice and j wasn't going to be petty. Still, annoying. <br><br>We tried the stone crab which you can order individually. We got 4 pieces which came out to 25.00! Expensive. It was good and very chilled. So we got sides of fried asparagus and Mac and cheese. Both phenomenal.  Mac and cheese was SUPER cheesy and the fried asparagus with lemon was great. Can't go wrong with fried shit!<br><br>So I got the filet Oscar for the main meal.

You're greeted by men in starched white shirts and bow-ties.  I felt, my second visit, that the hype doesn't live-up to the reality. While service is brisk the food that arrived at our table was ordinary. I had the grouper special--a rather bland piece of fish served without fanfare.  This restaurant uses the Ruth Chris model--everything is ordered separately. I also got the watermelon and feta salad--too salty and the flavors just didn't blend well. The side of broccolini was heavily  buttered and steamed. Their unique potato side was the only standout. Drinks are quite pricey and the wine pours are not at all generous--the opposite, really. Their pies were the most prized part of the meal--the coconut cream and chocolate cream were both outstanding. I would head their just for the pies. Overall, for the amount of traffic and price range, I'm not sure what all the fuss is about except sometimes an old, iconic restaurant takes on a life of its own regardless of the reality.

After a few sips, ~10 min wait, the host tells us he's got a table - score! Wait for it...table was situated in a communal dining fashion. Ok, because the food will make up for us being uncomfortably sandwiched between two other couples, or will it really...<br>Ordered seafood platter which was super scrumptious (4 lg shrimp, 3 small lobster tails, and a children's serving of fun-sized scallops), she ordered halibut -best ever, but that is all you get is a slice of halibut, so we also ordered sweet potato fries - came with a couple specs of seasoning and were begging to be dipped into something. That's right, absolutely no sauce, not even a suggestion or recommendation of sauce. Now for the long cold wait for our cold waiter's return so I can ask about sauce for my now cold sweet potato fries. Thankfully a waitress with good instincts recognized our distress signal and desperation. So having studied the menu I keenly asked for some of their sweet mustard sauce that the accompanied some of the more affluent entrees. All the while my expectations for this place are smoldering (who makes sweet potato fries and doesn't think to offer a sauce?). <br>It was somewhat of an occasion for us so let's wrap this up in a bow of some sort of pie.

I have been to Joe's 3 times, I don't really remember much from the first time it was 5-6 years ago when my husband and I where dating, the 2nd time was about 1.5 years ago but I had received a gift card and sometimes having a free meal can blur your dining experience. But this review is about my most recent visit about 3 weeks ago for my husband's birthday.<br>We decided to go to Joe's as my husband had a taste for seafood and we had other plans for the evening. I made a reservation for 3pm, mentioning it would be 2 adults 2 children. When u have kids you plan things differently, this is off peak lunchtime and not busy dinner time either. We get there and they say they're going to prepare the table for us, which is fine. The restaurant had maybe a handful of people at the bar and even the dining room only had a few full tables. But where do they sit us with a 2 year old and a 4 month old in a car seat? Right in the middle of the dining room, why that would make sense I don't know (yes I understand that there is some process of seating sections and what not but if a restaurant is practically empty you should put small children in a corner off to the side somewhere, common sense.) <br>So we sit down and I'm getting my kids settled. The waitress comes to our table and my husband orders a glass of wine and I have the wine list in my hand and she yankes it from me saying \"let me save you some time\" and shoves the back of the menu at me. I honestly didn't even get the chance to realize that the menu I had was bottles, I didn't even open it, but already I was given the feeling that I was not considered an important guest at the restaurant. We ordered oysters, stone crab legs, I got a bisque and crab roll my husband got some sort of beef roll and my daughter ordered (for herself) Mac n cheese, which she was very excited about. <br>The oysters where good, the stone crab well some where good but some had a weird dry texture and no flavor (they even stuck to the shell which makes me feel like they where reheated or over cooked as they are served cold I don't know), my bisque was good my daughter decided she was going to eat it and spilled a little on the table cloth but she's 2, what can you expect. I decided that I would stick to water as my son needed to eat, but at some point I asked for a virgin piña colada which apparently they don't do blended drinks . Our food took forever to come out, not really sure why we hadn't order anything that even needed to be cooked, so of course by that time my daughter was out of her seat going back and forth between my husband and myself, not being bad but exactly the reason you don't sit kids in the middle of a dining room. My crab roll was good but that's pretty hard to mess up especially if your at a seafood restaurant, but my husband said his sandwich was just ok. Oddly enough my daughter spit out her Mac n cheese and made a face, when I tried her leftovers the next day I realized she wasn't being difficult, she was served pasta with cream of chicken soup, no cheese flavor what so ever, not even some melted on top I suspect this is the reason our food took so long so they could figure out what to do about the Mac n cheese and rather then just saying they're out they would rather trick a 2 year old because they're opinion doesn't matter.  I asked for our leftovers to be wrapped up receiving an eyeroll in the process and the bag was thrown on our table after a $150 bill plus tip was paid.<br>I guess a lot of my grip is with not only this restaurant but a lot of up scale restaurants downtown, the service I'm finding is really sub par for the prices you pay and the tips that are EXPECTED rather then earned. How is spending $150 on lunch not worth getting treated well? Because I have kids? I mean most people know that people who have kids NEED a nicer experience because it means more to them because they probably don't go out every weekend. Mind you this restaurant HAS a kids menu, complete with coloring book and fancy triangle crayons which gives the impression they welcome children, but my daughter didn't even receive her kids cup with her $9 cream of chicken soup pasta. I think that wait staff should not be tipped exorbitantly just because they work at a nice restaurant but they need to do their part to earn it, it's sad that I get better service at a Chinese take out restaurant that has tables or a golden corral then a \"fancy\" restaurant downtown. I have grown up in Chicago and am not in aww of going to eat downtown like a tourist, and I think these restaurants should do more to EARN people's business rather then treat patrons as it's a privilege to eat (and spend money) at their establishments.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Food was delicious and service was great.

In short, it's a ton of restaurants in the Chicago area that you can get points when spending and then cash out on meals/drinks after acquiring enough points. <br><br>If you're thinking of coming, I would definitely put in a reservation. The place was completely slammed for Valentine's Day as I expected, yet the service and overall experience was great. <br><br>For cocktails, the lady went for an old fashioned and I did the Manhattan over ice. Both were excellent and I appreciate they listened to the lady's request to go easy on the simple syrup for the old fashioned. Anyone notice how ridiculously clear and square the ice cubes are in the cocktails? Perfection in a glass at $12 a pop! <br><br>To start our meal, we did the seafood chopped salad which came with generous amounts of king crab, lobster, and shrimp. It was a rather good value for all the fresh seafood and doesn't break the bank. I dig it!<br><br>For the main course, we decided to skip out on their world famous stone crab claws and we opted to split their 30oz porterhouse cooked medium. Overall it was a solid steak, but a little bit disappointing that the filet side came almost well done while sirloin strip side was a perfect medium. <br><br>For sides, we did sautéed broccolini and the four cheese Mac n cheese. The broccolini was good but I felt like the portion was a bit too small for $10. The mac n cheese was quite delicious though.<br><br>To finish, we did a half slice of the key lime pie. That's right they do HALF SLICES! When you feel like you can fit no more, then you tell yourself it's just a half slice. Our waiter suggested the key lime as it's their most popular, I gotta say it did live up to the hype. <br><br>Anyways, it was an overall great experience.

We love steak and have been making our way through the top places in Chicago since we moved here. Joe's had been recommended to us by multiple people, so we had to give it a try. As of right now, Joe's ranks somewhere in the bottom half; still tasty, but not somewhere we'd likely come back to (this is written with the knowledge that Joe's is not just a steakhouse, but seafood place as well) . Full breakdown is below. <br><br>Atmosphere: A little dark. A little loud. In other words, not that much different than other steakhouses. Still, we didn't care for it that much. <br><br>Drinks: We didn't really want wine, so we went with cocktails and were both disappointed. She got the paloma cocktail on the menu, but it was too tart. I got the Boulevardier and wished I'd gotten a bourbon straight instead. It was too sweet for my taste. <br><br>Entrées: She got the filet with lobster tail while I got the filet and crab. The steak was well seasoned and cooked perfectly. Delicious. The lobster tail and crab were just okay. Nothing about either stood out. <br><br>Sides: Sides are all a la carte, so we got two to share. The mashed potatoes were pretty good, but not mind numbingly so (which may be too much to expect from mashed potatoes anyway). The roasted sweet corn, on the other hand, was amazing! Sadly, it may have been the best part of the meal. We also got a crab cake to go for her mom who was staying with us. I was told it was one of the best crab cakes either of them had had, but I didn't try it myself. <br><br>Desert: We decided to split the key lime pie, since apparently all the pies are made in house. Unfortunately, just because they make them in house doesn't mean they don't freeze them as well. Still, it did taste good, and the whipped cream was on point. <br><br>Verdict: Food was good enough to give it 4 stars, but as I mentioned above, we probably won't be back. There are just too many good places to eat in Chicago to go back to a place we didn't enjoy that much.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "delicious food in an upscale environment without being pretentious. Arrived at Joe's at 9:40, without a reservation, and they closed at 10:30. I'm not proud of that, but they didn't bat an eye.

We had steak with asparagus and mashed potatoes on the side for our entrees. The steak was cooked perfectly with a nice sear, and the sides were splendid. Also enjoyed a key lime pie with coffee for dessert which was tart and not overly sweet. Joe's was the perfect end to this Chicago vacation.

Having been to Joe's several times in the past, we were well aware that a Friday night is a tough reservation to get, so out of character for us we booked our 7:30pm reservation a month in advance. Arriving on time, we reported to the host that we were a complete party.  As expected the place was packed and not surprisingly we were told it would be several minutes before we could be seated. 45 minutes and a martini with blue cheese olives later we were still standing in the bar/foyer with the crowd waiting for our name to be called. The excitement of a great meal to come was being replaced with pique when our name was finally called at 8:15pm.<br>As soon as we arrived at our table, our server, Jennifer Rowan and the attentive staff at Joes madeit their mission to make our wait a distant, hazy memory. <br>The tuna and steak tartar arrived in minutes and were cold, delicious and clean in flavor and complimentary. The oysters on the half shell were so fresh with a crisp,wonderfully briny finish.<br>For our entres we shared the nights special of dry aged bone-in ribeye, a large Alsakan King crab plate served chilled, Dover sole with brown butter, and a large stone crab for each diner. Each item was perfectly prepared. The steak was incredibly flavorful, with a medium rare center and perfectly carmelized exterior. The Dover sole, deboned at the table was as good as Mon Ami Gabi's and the old now defunct, Nick's Fishmarket. If you experienced the Dover sole at Mona Ami or Nick's you know what I am talking about. The King crab was sweet and as fresh as you will find outside of Alaska and the stone crab was a good as I remember having at the original Joe's in Miami Beach. The lyonnaise potatoes  were crispy, savory, rich and delicious and one order is enough for a table of 4. For beverages there was a gewurtztraminer from Alsace and a full bodied Chianti Classico . To end our evening we finished with Joe's tres leche cake which is on a par with Frank's Butter Cake at Francesca's Hole in the Wall. So good!<br>So how good was our experience?

My 20 oz bone in ribeye came with a beautiful crust, cooked perfectly medium, juicy, with a generous amount of fat marbling.. Yum. I ate the entire thing in one sitting. The ex said the filet mignon was good, and the sides were plentiful for two people. Tip: Get a half order of the onion straws, a full order is giant and the half order could easily feed three people. The coconut cream pie was made with fresh whipped cream and was very decadent. I tried a bite of my companion's key lime pie and it was perfectly tart, with fresh lime flavor, a nice crust, and tasted quite refreshing. There is a complimentary bread basket with an assortment of goods, like onion bread, sesame parmesan wafers, and sweet raisin biscotti- like crisp bread.  Yum. This restaurant is very expensive, but the food quality and service is top notch.

The food was fantastic, and the service was exceptional, especially our server, Colleen! We'll definitely be back!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "My husband and I came here to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary. We had heard good reviews and wanted to try a place we had not been to before, so we booked the reservation two weeks beforehand. When we got there, the bar area was packed! As soon as we mentioned our names with the host, we were seated right away, in a back booth. The ambiance of the whole restaurant is upscale, but relaxing. The restaurant area was completely full as well. Even though there were many people there, and music playing, we could still hold a conversation with each other, without raising our voices, or being able to hear other conversations. It really helped make it feel like it was just us there! Our waiter was Jose and he was truly wonderful! He made suggestions, friendly banter, and gave us a few surprises throughout the evening. We ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio to start off, while telling Jose it was our 1st wedding anniversary. When he came back, he surprised us with two champagne glasses for a toast! It was so sweet and definitely a great start to our evening. For our appetizers, we ordered the steak tartare and a half dozen oysters. It was the first time we tried steak tartare, and it was... Interesting. It certainly wasn't bad, I just don't really have anything I could compare it to! My husband really enjoyed it, but we both agreed we wouldn't go out of our way to order it somewhere. The oysters were very fresh! We tried two of each of the three types, and our favorite were the Foley Shamrock from Prince Edward Island, Canada. At last minute, we decided to try the crab bisque before our entrees came out because there were so many reviews and pictures of it posted on Yelp. SO GLAD WE DID. The soup literally tasted like you were eating creamy, buttery crab deliciousness. It just slowly glides down your tongue and every tastebud is in pure ecstasy. Seriously, I told my husband I could just eat that bisque all day, every day. For our entrees, I ordered the grilled seafood platter, which had Madagascar Shrimp, Lobster Tail, and Scallops. The shrimp was my favorite part!! It was huge! The meat was tender and seasoned well with this light sauce laying underneath that I dipped each bite in. The lobster tail was delightful as well, although I did steal a little bit of my husbands butter to better enjoy it. The scallops were alright- not fantastic, but not bad. My husband ordered the filet mignon and lobster tail. It was his first time ordering lobster tail and he loved it!! He was able to finish his whole plate (I brought some home), and was very happy (and full) afterward. Jose came back to ask us if we saved room for dessert and we had to turn him down. It was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do, since dessert is my favorite meal. We asked for the check politely and a few minutes later, he just couldn't help but surprise us again with a slice of key lime cheesecake! I could only manage one small bite- but it was incredible!!! I wish I had had more room to eat the whole cake! The citrus flavor was strong, but mixed with the soft, creamy cheese, it was just perfect. My husband had a few more bites, but that was all he could manage too. We were both still full the next morning!!!<br>Overall, we want to thank Jose and Joe's for giving us a wonderful experience to share our 1st anniversary at. We highly recommend!!!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/48i3yLRFK2vLeRVl1n00-g/348s.jpg", "caption": "Champagne toast for our 1st wedding anniversary"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-1io_rLSD13pXnP_2BVHwQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Steak Tartare"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kXto5NMYy5v9w0n3uQEpZw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Oysters"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Excellent restaurant, as you'd expect from one of the most highly rated places in all of the Windy City! <br><br>The service was spectacular.

My time and effort paid off like a Grand Slam in the bottom of the ninth of a championship game with Joe's Seafood Restaurant. <br><br>Joe's is a Five Star in food, service, ambiance, atmosphere, and knowing how to make a first time diner feel like a regular. The restaurant is located in what I will call Downtown Chicago; also referred to as the Near North Side. Our hotel was walking distance so we did not utilize any parking or a Valet in dining at the restaurant.<br><br>We arrived on time for our reservation and after a very friendly greeting were escorted to our table. There are tables and a nice bar in the entrance area. The restaurant itself is on the first floor and is very large. Even though our dinner was on a weekday night every seat in the house was occupied the entire time we were there. It is very easy to understand why this is the case.<br><br>The service at Joe's is on the level of what I am accustomed to at Commander's Palace in New Orleans. Steve K, our assigned server,  was even recruited to leave his home and move to the Crescent City by me. Attentive and never overbearing; informative and friendly; knowledgeable of the food and the wine on the menu; and something new and agreeable. <br><br>First off Steve offered the tasting of the wine we selected to my wife. That is rarely done but most appreciated since we are equal partners in life. And the new experience was that Steve asked us when he should place the order in for the various courses. This made the dinner even more enjoyable since we controlled when the food would be prepared. He would put the appetizer order in after we enjoyed our drinks and so on for each course. <br><br>Joe's is definitely a place a visitor dreams about how it would be if he or she lived in Chicago. So many luscious offerings on the menu to decide upon and it was so difficult. After much thought our decisions were made and the choices were all at the Five Star level.<br> <br><br>We enjoyed a small cup of the Crab Bisque. Taste and flavor make us feel as if we were home. Surprised that a restaurant so far from the Gulf could produce such taste. The Crab Cake appetizer was made with jumbo lump crab meat and, although different from my usual, was delicious and I was enjoying the way my taste buds were dancing at each fork full of pleasure. <br><br>Other side dishes prepared to perfection were the Four Cheese Mac & Cheese and the Crispy Shoestring Onion Rings. The Chef had to be taught his talent somewhere in the South. No need for any additional spices or flavor at any time. <br><br>Our main course was divine and both my wife and I decided on the same thing. The Crab Stuffed Shrimp makes you think that you are in heaven. Large beautiful deveined Shrimp stuffed with Crab Meat. It is really just too good. It is so good I was thinking that I may have to go to confession and declare that I have sinned in a weird sort of way. Anything that good has to be a sin. <br><br>The wine selected and enjoyed was a Cuvaison Chardonnay. <br><br>Observing the staff operate was like taking in a Symphony in concert. The men and women of this restaurant are good and it shows. Some other comments are that the wine list is vast and reasonable. Restrooms are clean but use the one upstairs for it is a little larger. And if you have room for desert the Key Lime Pie is scrumptious. <br><br>The review is rather long but I feel that Five Stars should be. <br><br>This place has my Seal of Approval!!!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Had a great dining experience.

I could distinctly taste carbonation.  Main course:  Grilled seafood platter.  Shrimp, lobster and scallops were of excellent quality, but the dish was spoiled by being prepared extremely salty.  Strawberry ice cream pie was OK at best.  My wife had Manhattan clam chowder and oriental style sea bass, and she liked both.  Overall 3 stars.  It did not help that we were seated in a booth next to a large and very noisy group.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Wow, Joe's, you really impressed.  As a Californian, the first thing I think about when I hear Joe's and Crab is the ubiquitous and casual Joe's Crab Shack on the West Coast and most of the United States.  While Joe's Stone Crab is also a chain, it's completely distinct and has locations only in Las Vegas, Miami, and Washington D.C.<br><br>The atmosphere is also much more upscale.  Whereas our recent meal at Bavette's seemed like a throwback to a speakeasy and the 1920's era, Joe's has a class and business ambiance reminiscent of the white table cloths and formally attired waiters of the 1950's.  It's obviously a place popular for business and power meetings, although they were a small scattering of casually dressed families throughout the dining room.<br><br>Service is both efficient and professional with water glasses being filled seamlessly and dropped spoons being replaced quietly and quickly.  Coloring books and crayons are provided for the younger clientele as are high chairs and booster seats for those with young family.  <br><br>But Joe's is really about the seafood.  So you can imagine my disappointment when they told us they had already sold out their small and limited allotment of their famous Florida Stone Crab Claws.  Crab season supposedly has been tough so this is becoming a more common occurrence.  Our selection:<br><br>Mojito - classic cocktails done without fuss.  Nothing fancy or innovative but refreshing.<br><br>Crab Bisque - excellent.  A very small scoop of crab meat is placed in the center of a large bowl and the bisque is poured around it.  Served piping hot and both rich and full of crab flavor.  <br><br>Pacific Rock Crab Claws - related to the Florida Stone Crab Claws and much more abundant.  We opted for an order (by the lb) and found them strikingly similar in appearance to the Florida Stone Crab.  Chilled and pre-cracked for easy eating, the Pacific Rock Crab Claws were super fresh and delicious.  Supposedly, Florida Stone Crab Claws are even sweeter and even better, so now I'm convinced I'll have to be back or find them.  $42/lb.  <br><br>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs - Offered with table-side service, the Alaskan King Crab Legs are brought whole to the table and expertly cracked in minutes by the waiters.  Chilled and served with their signature mustard, they pop easily out of the shell and are amazing.  I've had Alaskan King crab cooked many ways, but these were some of the sweetest and freshest I've had.  <br><br>Four Cheese Mac & Cheese - a cheesy and delicious classic side dish.  <br><br>Vanilla Ice Cream - complimentary dessert.  Good quality vanilla bean flavor.<br><br>Key Lime Pie - their signature dessert and served chilled like the seafood.  It's perfectly tart with a wonderful crust.  As a first time diner, they also made the single slice (plenty for sharing) complimentary.<br><br>Overall, we had a great meal at Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab.  The old school atmosphere and up-scale service were a joy to have and they didn't blink having our family sitting right in the midst of power dinners between businessmen and professionals.  The seafood was top notch and every dish was fresh as can be.  Now that I know what Stone Crab Claws are, I am on a mission to have the select Florida Stone Crab claws.  Everything is expensive here, but it truly is a top notch dining experience if you can swing the visit.  (reservations recommended as it seems most people can and make dining here a priority even on weekdays)<br><br>Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab accepts credit cards including American Express.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dVTxbF5JlBY6LfDAHF207A/348s.jpg", "caption": "Complimentary Key Lime Pie"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TQQH6BHSccyJD0hrXZ-CuA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Complimentary Vanilla Ice Cream"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JkHqrY2DlfEAz5Ru2gEd1g/168s.jpg", "caption": "Alaskan King Crab Claws"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Absolutely delicious.

We expected so much from this place because of good yelp reviews. Either it was a bad day today for them or its all a hype. We looked forward to this visit to celebrate Father's Day and we came out very unsatisfied. Our son ordered a full-size (not from the kiddie menu and not the petite) filet mignon and yet was served the petite. The server said, here's you 'petite filet mignon'. We thought fine, maybe the server  misunderstood and our son was too hungry to wait for the bigger portion. When we got the check, we were charged the prize for the full-size filet mignon. And again, already very disappointed to even make an appeal. We just wanted to get out of there. Moving on, my husband ordered the 1lb Alaskan King Crab which did not look like a pound at all. We like eating crabs so we know what a pound looks like. In all, the crabs were okay. Nothing eye-popping or heart-warming about it. Just okay. I had the Filet Oscar which is a petit filet mignon and 4oz of Alaskan King crab. Again, just okay. It came with its own sauce but I like my crab with butter. To make the experience worse, I wasn't done eating yet and the server started cleaning up our table just because my husband and son were already finished. That's fine except he took away my butter. Again, already disappointed to even argue. Our toddler just wanted fries and that's the only thing that came out as expected.

Not worth the price. But I guess go for the experience but don't have high expectations. <br>Once you enter, there's a podium like area where the host is, to your right, there's complimentary coat check. Definitely make a reservation bc it was packed when I went and it was a Tuesday night. If you don't make a reservation, you'll probably end up waiting for a while or have to opt for their bar area (the front of the house/ area around the host's podium). I was with my parents and the three of us shared the seafood salad, porterhouse, stone crab claws, seasonal fish (wild bass), key lime pie, and the butterscotch pie. The seafood salad was great only bc of the ingredients. It lacked flavor and acidity. I've had stone crab claws before, fresh at asian supermarkets for much cheaper. But since it's their specialty, I chose the 7 mediums for $40. There's nothing great about them. The sauce was horse radish based and did make them taste better but it's not something worth raving over. Porterhouse melted in my mouth and was even better with the salt/pepper concoction they gave on the side. Yes, it could've used a little more seasoning. No, I'm not a salt/seasoning freak. Wild bass is not worth noting about and something you can skip. Butterscotch pie was like mousse and was delicious. Key lime was their most popular pie but it was meh, no different than any other I've had before. The best thing of the night aside from the steak was the bread they give you. Huge variety and were all very delicious. My main complaint is how god damn cramped the whole place is. It's the worse when the servers have their little stand out to serve the food. You'll be stuck in the middle of the damn place for 10 minutes waiting for them to make space for you.

Now with it being Saturday night, I figured I should call and see if there was a wait -- and of course, I was told it would be about 2 hours. I was told, however, that if we sat in the bar area, it would still be a full menu, but it was a first-come, first-serve basis. My man and I decided to try our luck so we stopped in, and lo and behold, there was a table in the bar area open... as if it was waiting for us!<br><br>We quickly pounced on it and got settled in, patiently waiting for service. It took a wee bit for the waitress to come over, but it was only because it was quite busy. She brought over our menus, got our drinks, and got our food order in pretty quickly. I ordered the Filet Oscar cooked medium rare, and HIGHLY recommend it!!! The filet was so tender and flavorful, cooked absolutely perfectly; my knife went through it like butter. My man ordered the Bone-in Filet, which was so tasty, and tender. Since the filets are \"a la carte\" we ordered mashed potatoes and sautéed mushrooms to share. The mashed potatoes were so creamy and good, with some ooey gooey cheese throughout, and the mushrooms were sautéed to perfection with mouthwatering flavor! Well, the food certainly didn't last very long...<br><br>For dessert, we ordered the Peanut Butter Pie with hot fudge, and the Havana Dream Pie (don't panic, they were both HALF slices... yes, you can do that, so that you can try more than one flavor of pie). And I ordered the Classic Irish Coffee to go with the pie... Mmm! When our dessert came to the table, they accidentally brought us Key Lime Pie and the Peanut Butter Pie; now I'm not a fan of Key Lime Pie, but I tried it nonetheless (I thought it was the Havana Dream Pie, only realized it was Key Lime after taking a bite), and it was actually pretty good. The Peanut Butter Pie didn't stand a chance though... I devoured that half slice! <br><br>We told our waitress about the mixup and she corrected it and brought us the Havana Dream Pie quickly... and I had a few bites of that as well (which was amazingly delicious! I recommend it!) The Classic Irish Coffee took a while, and right when I started thinking our waitress maybe forgot to put the order in, she brought it over, apologizing that the bartender hand-whipped the cream for it so it took extra long... but she told us that it was \"on her\" for taking so long. She was an absolute doll; I wish I could remember her name. <br><br>All in all, the experience was great... the atmosphere was laid back, and the food and staff were phenomenal!!!

Not over seasoned and not bland.. Thank god. The texture was luscious. It also comes with a nice little plate of charred crostini's to spread it on.  What a solid well executed simple dish.<br><br>  Stone Crab: AKA star of the show.

Anywho, this was my very first time having Stone crabs. We don't get those here in SoCal and if anyone has the dibs on where I can, that would be SWEEEEEEEET!!!! Luckily the waitress told me an alternative crab that almost has the same taste, that could be found in my hood YAY!!!!!! Back to the crack stone crabs. This was probably some of the freshest seafood I've ever had. I also love how easy it is to get the meat out. I'm pretty intimidated by shellfish that make me work for my food LOL. I feel like a cavewoman trying to open up shit HAHA. Ever since my last bite of these crab claws, I've been thinking about them weekly.  You can not come here and not order these. It would be disrespectful to their namesake!<br><br> Roasted Turkey sandwich:  Yea I got a turkey sammie for my main meal LOL. I purposely ordered this because my hotel room didn't have a fridge and this would be the easiest leftover  to travel with back to the room HAHA. I'm the leftover queen!  The sandwich comes on a toasted multigrain bread and is stuffed with carved turkey, avocado, pork belly, tomato and sprouts. I usually hate sprouts, but these were no bother. Nothing super mouthgasmic about the sandwich, just a solid fulfilling sandwich. It also comes with fries but I wanted onion straws and those were nice and crispy with a little sweetness. I could eat a whole plate of those!  I kinda wish I ordered the DIP, but my leftover priorities took over ;)<br><br> Branzino w/lemon and capers:  This was the Docs dish but of course I had to get a taste in! We also ordered broccolini as a side. If you're watching your weight, this is a great dish to be had. But lets be honest who would be watching their weight visiting Chicago. He lives here and can have Chicago eats anytime LOL. His dish was very good. Again the seafood is outstanding on its freshness. It was nice and flakey and the broccolini was a great pairing.

The Stonecrab come in 3 different sizes (essentially regular, large, and custom-picked) with respectively increasing prices. The Alaskan King Crab legs are definitely market-priced items, but if you're looking to splurge, try out the sea-food app platter, including Alaskan King crab, lobsters, oyster and jumbo shrimp for about $25pp. My fiancée and I got these two, as well as the seafood chopped and a side of cream spinach. Similar to everyone's comments, the seafood salad definitely does not skimp on the generous portions crab, lobster and shrimp over a bed of fresh crispy greens. The cream spinach is good, but that was more for my fiancee than anything else. The stone crab legs (which can be purchased individually) came perfectly cracked and were sweet, juicy and well-worth the review. The Alaskan King crab legs from the sampler were good...but I can't tell if it's worth an arm or leg. The bread basket that everyone raved about was good, but certainly not as divine as I had anticipated, but there was a good spread of different carbohydrates to fill you up. My biggest disappointment for such a high class place was the service. Our waiter was just not excited about serving us and never made us feel welcomed in the restaurant. We dressed the part, and were incredibly excited to indulge in this restaurant as part of our culinary journey, but we were treated like second-tier diners the entire time. Needless to say, I was very upset until he brought complimentary desserts for our recent engagement. While his service certainly could use some improvement, I can't argue against the richness of the key lime cheesecake.

Our server was super nice and as everyone says, service is on point over here, nothing was forgotten and everything was presented perfectly, she gave us some great recommendations and we obviously started with a few drinks. For an appetizer I decided to forgo my usual calamari just because I wanted to do different. We did get those over talked about stone crabs and they were phenomenal. 7 medium ones were $40 which I thought was kind of expensive for what you are getting, but they were delicious, I just wish there was more of them. The mustard mayo sauce that is served with them is to die for but you could also get their horseradish cocktail sauce as well on the side. For my entree I decided to get the crab stuffed shrimp and they were delicious. The shrimp were huge and there were four of them and they literally tasted like lobster because they're from the same family and these were gigantic shrimp. My husband is a big fan of lobster rolls but they didn't have any so he ordered the alaskan king crab roll and I took a bite of it and all I have to say is that it is EVEN better. I mean for $25 or so you get so much luscious king crab and the brioche fun is warm and buttery and it was delicious. Also, it is served with their sweet potato fries which are my favorite things ever so that is always a plus. <br><br>Oh, how can I forget about their legendary bread basket, I was hoping it would be amazing but I only really liked the warm onion bread roll, everything else was kind of just blah.

Okay, so onto the dessert, we couldn't decide so we got both the key lime pie and the banana cream pie and they were both delicious if I had to choose which was better for next time it would have to be the key lime pie because it had the perfect amount of tanginess to it. Except I need my dessert to have chocolate and lots of it to be exact. Overall, an amazing place, definitely save up for a special occasion or that perfect date night because it's definitely not cheap, but truly awesome.

The filet mignon was amazing: very tender, cooked to perfection, and had just the right amount of seasoning along with a finishing touch seasoning on the side which was great: a very little bit went a very long way and added flavor. The crab was delicious and very convenient to eat so that made it much more enjoyable. Not a big veggie guy, but the asparagus was good and the bearnaise sauce went well with all aspects of the entreé. We also got a complimentary slice of key lime pie and I ordered a peanut butter hot fudge pie and both were a delicious end to a great meal.

Very polite, helpful, and knowledgeable about any questions we had. After we had our stone crab, she squeezed lemon juice on our hands and gave us a hot towel. This was new to me and to be honest it kind of blew my mind and had no idea what was going on at the time, but it really showed me how nice of a place Joe's is. <br><br>Great atmosphere, perfect lighting and had nice decor. Also, had some nice tropical paintings on the walls so it went well with the seafood. Kind of felt like I was on a beach in my suit eating a delicious steak. Classy music at a reasonable volume was also a plus. Only thing I would've liked to see was a dress code. In a nice place like this, would've liked Joe's to require at least business casual because I kind of got a vibe that there were a bunch of a**holes in t shirts and shorts in there who didn't respect the establishment. Was just sad to me. <br><br>Other than dress code, had pretty much a perfect experience I and would highly recommend and hope to return.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "4.5 OUT OF 5<br><br>Sometimes you just get what you pay for I suppose. At #JoesSeafoodPrimeSteakAndStoneCrab, that is certainly the case. <br><br>We arrived with no reservation. We had been walking up and down Mag mile for the better part of the day and needed a meal pronto. The formal dining room only caters to reservations but the host encouraged us to wait for a table in the open informal dining space upfront (first come first serve). So we literally stalked a few tables until we spotted a set of matrons asking for their bill. Bingo!<br><br>Twenty minutes after our arrival we were seated and ready to eat. And did we ever!  <br>Every dish served and every glass poured was enjoyed. <br><br>APPETIZERS<br><br>We had the colossal lump crab cake and the fried calamari- both were phenomenal and if you read my reviews you know I am never impressed with calamari in the North American region! The crab cake was the slightly better choice, and I love that it comes in an appetizer size (one cake) or in an entree size (two cakes)- we got the latter and shared.<br><br>ENTREES<br><br>I went for the large filet mignon (12oz as opposed to 8oz) with the Four Cheese Mac and Cheese and my friend tried the special, a Steak Au Poivre topped with mushroom with a side of Jennie's mashed potatoes.  <br><br>The Mac and Cheese was just what I needed in my life at that precise moment, and the steak was cooked perfectly. Mouth-watering through and through.<br><br>The steak au poivre was a limper cut of meat and the potatoes didn't floor us but they were good- I think I like my mash made traditionally or extra creamy and this one was very textured with a panko crumble finish. <br><br>But we couldn't complain about the actual taste of anything, except maybe the special's watery mushroom sauce. Also, that steak was ordered medium yet served medium rare but the waitress noticed right away and corrected that.  Consequently, and within minutes, a manager on duty brought us the new plate, apologizing profusely for the oversight. Great service makes up for bad anything.<br><br>WINE & DESSERT<br><br>My friend and I love our sweet tooth. Throughout the meal we sipped on a French riesling (Alsace region), although we should probably have opened with a white for the appetizer portion of the meal then moved on to a red with our entrees.  But we enjoyed the riesling too much to entertain that notion. Definitely a quality vine. <br><br>For once we did not have dessert. We polished off our wine and had coffee instead.<br><br>If it weren't for the initially undercooked steak (the special) and a couple absences on the menu (better desert options), I would have given Joe's an unabashed 5 out of 5. But quality meat and wine, wonderful service, free wi-fi and a classy environment earned Joe's more than a 4. So glad this was my last meal in Chicago. <br><br>I RECOMMEND- The crab cake paired with at least a glass or two of the Kuentz-Bas Riesling. Also many of the patrons seemed happy with the stone crabs.<br><br>EXTRA TIP- Save NO room for dessert. None of it is as appetizing as the main dishes. And stay away from the specials- go for that prime cut of meat or that great catch and spare no expense; you'll be happy you did.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oksA1WH4T_OFKeoLIG71tw/348s.jpg", "caption": "Filet mignon shot #2"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9IDzoP4jwjgQm59P5csrrQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Scrapped the plate for every drop #macandcheese"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tvnpchfriYG1UvQJNKOHhA/168s.jpg", "caption": "4cheese Mac n cheese"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Just walked up on this place with my wife.

Meat or seafood? Hash browns or mash potatoes? Cole slaw or grilled tomato? Since my bf was going for the filet I opted for the stone crabs. We both had the lobster bisque, which was quite delicious and well-seasoned, while a few other in our party had the chowder and surprise! It's a red chowder versus the norm white, creamy.

I'm not a \"lime\" dessert person so ended up with the banana pie which was decent. <br><br>So the food wasn't bad right? Well, let me tell you about their service. It definitely did not live up to an upscale, fancy restaurant standard. Our server had an attitude where he didn't care to wait on us and ignored our table quite often. We started counting how many times we would have to ask for straws, it ended up being 6! (We received it the last 15 minutes of our dining experience.) And we constantly had to ask for refills on our water, which left a lot of us thirsty. It took 15 minutes from when every single one of us finished our entree to receive our desserts. That's a really long time for desserts that doesn't have to be cooked. The bussers constantly kicked my chair and didn't even apologize, although they acknowledged that they kicked my chair. Wow, thanks. Oh, can I have some water now?<br><br>Service like this makes a lot of people not try RW because of the perception this would happen. Who knows maybe it'll be different if I came here for dinner and dressed up, but I'm still a paying customer and would expect the same service as anyone else.

People also tend to enjoy the steaks here, although I normally go for seafood. Also, check out their seasonal pies. I once had a blueberry peach pie here that I still dream about to this day. The salmon is also surprisingly good. I normally steer clear of salmon at restaurants because it's often over cooked and under seasoned, but these guys nail it every time. I highly recommend adding it to a salad. The fish and chips and the burger are also definitely worth checking out if you're in the the mood for either of those. Yeah, yeah, I know I've essentially listed the whole menu, but you seriously can't go wrong here. <br><br>In addition, the service is impeccable.

How are you supposed to taste the flavor of the seafood that you are paying $$$$$ for when it is stone cold (no this is not to be punny). Seafood should be served slightly chilled to enhance flavor. The \"melted butter\" dish they brought for the stone cold crab claws was also stone cold. The only item that was not stone cold was the ceviche, which was warmish? I absolutely hated the stone crab, and that is a strong word. They crack the claws for you in back before they bring it out so you are picking chunks of shell off of it before you consume it, and after severe inspection (as well as I could in the dimly lite room)  I still managed to get small chunks of shell in my mouth (so unpleasant-put me off for the rest of the night after I ate the second one and got the same result).<br>For a drink I ordered an old fashioned southern comfort sour with an olive garnish, another unpleasant experience, an olive that wasn't fully pitted so I got to spit yet another thing into my napkin.<br><br>Major Downfall: I also was blessed with food poisoning only 15 minutes after eating that consisted of cold chills, stomach cramps, and other side effects I wish not to mention that lasted for 3 hours.

My advice to you is....come here VERY hungry! There's ALOT of great stuff you'll want to try! It's also nice to come with a group/ that way you can share/sample each other's stuff. For apps we got the tuna poke, stone crab claws and the crab cakes. All delicious! For our entrées: I did the jumbo lobster tail, girlfriend did the king crab legs, and both our husbands did the bone-in filets. We all shared and had the most amazing surf & turf dinner. For sides we did the mac & cheese and corn. Mac & cheese was out of this world. When the dessert menus came out, we all had our eyes on 2 things.

Sometimes they ask you to wait for your table even if you have a reservation if you come on weekend evening during busy hours. <br>We were there few times, both for lunch and dinner. <br>Oysters Rockefeller or fried oysters, Alaskan king crab roll -really amazing palatable appetizers. <br>Since it's a prime steakhouse as well, try their steak tartar, it's really tender and delicate. If you eat raw meat of course. <br>For main - seared sea scallops, broiled swordfish, and Chilean seabass - all are differently fetching and very sipid. If you go for meat - filet mignon is always a right choice. But I don't like it for lunch, it's more my dinner preference.  <br>The whole section of the menu is dedicated to the potatoes. As for other sides - I wouldn't recommend grilled tomatoes, better go for creamed spinach. <br>Pretty \"well-tailored\" wine list fixed of commercially successful wines, mainly from the United States, France and few items from the rest of the world. Interesting pricing policy: on affordable wines they add just a small margin, on the middle segment - it's a reasonable, but on the expensive and very expensive it's just out of the logic. Particularly interested can order Cabernet from Screaming Eagle for $ 4900. By the way, that's one of few places where I saw \"Pursued by bear\" - one of my favorite Washington State red, for 145$ 2009 here, and we enjoyed it with a juicy steak tartar.<br>Various desserts for any liking and taste. My favorites are for now peanut butter pie and Boston cream pie. Key Lime pie is a bit soft for me, I prefer it more textured and firm. <br>Service attentive and good.

But not knowing the proper way to cook and finish a steak wasn't nearly as bad as the seasoning. It was like eating a salt lick. in fact all the food - potato, side of spinach, steak were all loaded with salt to the point where the food lost all identity in the dish. For me, if you don't know how to make something taste good you add a ton of salt and no one will be the wise.

But wines I know the wholesale on (and the full retail), wines I've ordered in other establishments are at least 2X more at this place is laughable.

I also really enjoyed oysters, sweet potato fries (they put a hint of cinnamon and sugar in them!), the grilled tomatoes, and the other vegetables were nice additions to the otherwise more protein heavy meal.

For what Joe's costs and the rave reviews I have always heard, I have to say I was a little disappointed.<br><br>For starters, I have to make a comment about atmosphere. I usually don't let this bug me too much, but again, for a \"fine dining\" restaurant like this, I kind of expect a little more civility. Unfortunately, the host station and waiting area are basically one and the same with the bar and some high top (I assume first come, first served) tables. It's very noise, very crowded with both patrons and wait staff worming their way through any waiting customers, and they're forced to call your name out over an intercom as though it's some kind of local watering hole. Once seated, our party of four ended up in a booth in a corner, which was kind of nice, being out of the way and a little quieter. <br><br>As for food, we started with the namesake stone crab - just one claw for each of us, since it seemed silly to come and not try it. Turns out...we could have skipped it. It was very watery, oddly textured, and nearly tasteless. A member of the party who has eaten at the Joe's in Florida reports that it's much better there, which i could easily believe, but this was just not impressive. There was also an order of the lobster bisque which was good, with a nicely textured cream base, but didn't make me jump out of my seat or anything.<br><br>For the entree, I do have to specifically call out our waiter. After three of us ordered the petite filet with king crab legs, he pointed out to us that the crab served with those filets is frozen, not fresh. And if we wanted, it would be basically the same price if we just each ordered a petite filet and then about 1.5lbs of king crab legs, since then the crab would be fresh. That's awesome advice, and we were glad to have it. I think they probably should note on the menu that you're about to get frozen crab meat, as I really wouldn't expect *any* of the crab to be frozen at a place like this that trades on its seafood. We also ordered the crab hot, since we all agreed we preferred that to chilled.<br><br>My steak was properly cooked, but was a little unremarkable. Was it good? Yes. But it doesn't really compare to the filets I've had at other steakhouses in the city, especially III Forks and Chicago Cut. Didn't have exceptional flavor, wasn't exceptionally tender, no delicious grill crust or salt and pepper outside. The crab legs had great flavor (reminding me why lobster ain't got nothin' on good king crab) and good texture, but honestly could have been hotter. They were basically warm - and again, we all agreed that we've best enjoyed them when they come out piping hot.<br><br>Our service, as mentioned was very friendly, and I liked the fresh lemon and hot towels to clean hands in between courses. Really nothing wrong with the service. Price was just high for what I think we got. I think we could easily have spent the same amount of money for steak or seafood elsewhere and been just as happy if not more happy. Our visit was motivated by a huge number of gift cards, which tempered any bill anger, but still.<br><br>So I'm wavering between three and four. Good service...very good king crab...OK steaks...bad stone crab. I think what tips me in the direction of three (and a strong three) is that the namesake item on the menu was just not good...plus nothing else was able to really blow me away or make me forget about it.

I went at those suckers full force, ordering the large size and jumping right in when they arrived...OK...HALT...what the hell? My crab is oozing water! My stone crab claws had been frozen! I didn't realize it wasn't stone crab season and paid a fortune for pre-FROZEN crab! I was more than disappointed. I was literally ready to cry as I'd been so excited!

I've had seafood all over Chicago (Catch 35, Devon Seafood Grill, GT, every steakhouse in town) and I think Joe's does it best, hands down. <br><br>We started with the jumbo Alaskan king crab legs. They are expensive- but they are worth it. They're served all cracked and cut open so it's minimal work but they were delicious. (Also, honorable mention for diverse and delicious bread basket!). For our entrees, I had the miso glazed Chilean sea bass, and my husband had the mahi mahi. They were so flavorful, and so  fresh. We're both from Florida so we know seafood, and it's tough to get good seafood sometimes in Chicago because we're so far inland. Our fish last night was absolutely fantastic. Sometimes fish is just so plain- but here it was really flavorful and delicious. We also shared the garlic creamed spinach and the mashed potatoes- both great.<br><br>Because it was our anniversary, we were given complimentary \"mocktails\" which was a nice surprise. We don't drink, but I think normally they'll bring out champagne so the mocktails were special for us. Also, since it was our first visit to Joe's, we got to try the key lime pie on the house.

The downside and reason for 3 instead of 4 stars, is due to poor service. The waiter was more miss than hit when it came to the time between drink order, appetizer, then entree and finally follow up. We ordered drinks and it took about 15 minutes to get them. At the time we ordered drinks we ordered oysters and the waiter forgot so we had to remind him. Then after the oysters are done it takes a while to order our dinner. Again, there were times when we had to remind the waiter of something we had said before that he missed. Finally, it was a person in the group's birthday the waiter brought two desserts (he did not ask anyone their preference) he brought a gluten-free choice and a key lime pie. Again, it was nice but he should have asked our preference. Realizing his mistake he did try to make amends by taking the cheaper dessert off of the bill. On the good side, the price versus quality of food was excellent, surprisingly affordable.

While the lion's share of the kudos go to our waiter, Darren, the experience was consistent. On the food alone, I might yield four stars. The service takes it to five.<br><br>We are seated in a cozy booth, A small, variegated  bread basket arrives, My wife had a glass of Pauly Riesling, while I enjoyed a Negroni and my son slurped a dirty, blue cheesy olivey Martini. <br><br>The smallest of the three sizes of stone crab was the only one available. We had the Pacific crab claws instead - Darren likened them to a sauvignon blanc with the standard stone crabs being a chardonnay - an apt analogy. Cold and meaty, they were excellent. <br><br>My wife's halibut filet was a small portion - but then again Darren had advised her that the on the bone halibut was the larger portion. We didn't get a taster. Fils and I both went for the bone-in rib steak. Perfectly cooked  it had been buttered and seasoned to a delicious richness, but the mineral taste of the beef was somewhat obscured. I would have preferred a little maitre d hotel butter on the side. Blame Del Frisco's and Ruth's Chris for creating a taste for these buttered steaks. Darren did present us with a house made seasoning blend that mitigated  the butter.. I would rate the steak as solid, but not the best I have ever had. <br><br>For sides we went with an special of braised artichoke hearts with a bit of fennel, the roasted corn, and sauteed spinach. The artichoke hearts were the best - the portion was small but serving fresh artichoke hearts is a lot of work and costly, so I get that. I thought the roasted corn was nothing special, although better than the version at Primehouse. Bones in Atlanta is my choice for corn side at a steakhouse. Sauteed spinach was a generous protion, not oily, could have used a bit more garlic or other seasoning.<br><br>Glasses of Paradoxx red washed the steak down - they were superb, if pricey at $20 each.<br><br>Being newbies we were gifted with a slice of key lime pie, and one slice served three after the sumptuous steak. Double espressos were coffee bar quality, quite good.<br><br>To sum, as a comparison, I'd say the meat was about as good as I got at Chicago Cut, but the overall experience here was far more pleasant. I suppose my only complaint is that this is part of the Lettuce Entertain You Archipelago and not the natural born offspring of the Miami Beach original.

So, I wanted to show the New Yorker what Chicago has to offer, and I thought this would be a good place for a birthday dinner.

We get there exactly at 10, and were seated right away. <br><br>Okay, so no problem. The waitress was friendly, we ordered drinks and appetizers and this is sort of where the experience went downhill. We ordered the whale and a wedge salad. We wanted to dine and take our time and enjoy my birthday dinner, but they were clearing our plates before we were even finished. The ice tray that the whale is served on still had food on it that needed to be chilled, but the bus boy took the multiple food items off of the ice, put it on a side plate and took the ice away. Why? I don't see the point of it. I felt so rushed, and I don't think they were trying to turn our table it was past 10:00 at night. And even if they were going to turn the table, don't do that, especially from such a \"fine\" establishment like Joe's. <br><br>Then we told our waitress just to slow things down, we felt rushed, etc. etc., and she responds with: well what else do you want me to do? Um I don't know, say you're sorry, treat us nicer, accommodate the paying customer? Then she avoided us for most of the rest of the night. <br><br>I was not as happy with this restaurant as I expected to be. The whale appetizer and wedge salad was tasty.

The best crab cake I've ever eaten! Their crab cake had less filling and LOTS of crab meat.<br><br>Then we had the grilled lobster tail. That was very tasty. Although it was a bit \"grilled too long\" since we tasted the \"burn-ness\" of the fire on the lobster. It was okay.<br><br>We had the 1.5 lb Alaskan King crab legs. Wow, they are filling!

I made a last minute Friday night reservation for 4 because we were in Chicago for Easter and realized it was stone crab season so we're like why not. Thank goodness they had a reservation for 530pm and upon walking into the restaurant they told me they were completely booked out. The hostess led us to our table and we were greeted by our server right away. Our server's name was Denise and she is AHMAZINGGGG. We gave us the menus and proceeded to explain all the different options they have (and she definitely highlighted the important stuff which was helpful since the menu was SOOOOO long). She was very knowledgeable and told us how the stone crabs were different between the medium, large, and selected. She describe certain dishes that made me want to order it right away. After extensively explaining the menu to me she gave us some time to discuss amongst ourselves. She came back a few minutes after but we couldn't make up our minds yet because there was too many options and we were debating between many things. When she came back to take our order i had to ask her again what her opinion was because i was between the filet and lobster tail or the chilean sea bass. I ended up with the chilean sea bass because she described the flavor so well. <br><br>For starters we had the crab bisque soup and the stone crabs. I have never eaten stone crabs before and she simply described how to eat it as she was serving it on our plates. The stone crabs were boiled, chilled,a nd cracked so it was very simple to eat. BOY WERE THEY FRESH!!!!! it was delicious and coming from me it means a lot because I don't eat seafood due to the fishiness but this crab was nice and juicy with no fishiness a all. The mustard sauce that comes with it complimented the crabs very well and before we know it the crabs were all gone. The crab bisque was also DELICIOUS! super flavorful and again not fishy at all. ONTO THE ENTREE!! I got the chilean sea bass, my sister got the filet with alaskan king crab, my mom got the dover sole, and my dad got the filet with lobster tail. To share, we got the mac and cheese, sweet potato, and asparagus. The chilean sea bass was DELICIOUS!!!!! it came with a few pieces of bokchoy but the fish itself was super fresh and the miso glaze gave it the perfect sweet tangy taste. The dover sole was fried and the chief comes out to filet it in front of you which was definitely a plus. Denise came back to the table as our food was serve and we talked about stone crabs, again she was super knowledgeable and told me when stone crab season started and ended and some history about the restaurant. All the dishes were delicious, but if you were to order just one entree i would definitely go with the dover sole!!! Mac and cheese on the side was definitely most worth it. <br><br>When it came time for dessert we honestly did not have room for anything so we were gonna share one pie amongst everyone. We asked Denise if we should order the tres leche pie or their signature key lime pie. Without a second thought she goes \"why not order both? we do half pies!\" I was so excited to hear that I told her we will take both then. After a couple of minutes she bought it out and they were DELICIOUS!!! Me and my sister were both kind of shock how big they were for half slices and we were saying how if we ordered whole slices we would never finish. But desserts was definitely the cherry on top!!! Denise came over again to ask about the desserts and we said it was amazing, and she tells me they were actually full slices! Denise knew we were from out of town and said the key lime pie was on the house!!! AMAZING SERVICE!!!!!!! I would definitely return to this restaurant next time I'm in Chicago but besides the amazing food, the server was DEFINITELY the biggest highlight of the meal!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This place is one of my favorites in Chicago.  I love the service and food is awesome", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Went to this place with a friend from out of town for Saturday dinner because I had a 100 bucks gift card.  After the big disappointment of Morton's, I really had no hopes for other steakhouses in town.  However, plethora of positive reviews about this place led me to try this instead of using the card for the souffle at L2O (which I will do in the near future, too).<br><br>Got there at 6pm without the reservation, and the host told us there was no seat available in the dining room until 10:30pm...

You never have a bad review when you bring a client here for lunch or dinner. <br><br>My ONLY bad experience in 6+ years dining here was a weird tasting stone crab delivery that I emailed the restaurant about and they paid for my meal AND gave me a gift card to apologize.  I look forward to many, many more delicious seafood dinners here.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I am sometimes skeptical of \"Lettuce\" venues but Joe's was a treat but flawed also The restaurant was absolutely packed on a Thursday, even during a Bears (albeit pre-season) game.<br><br>Our group was 3 couples and the 5 to10 star and beyond experience was definitely the service. Our waiter and everyone assisting him  was spot on point. I drink ice water often during my meal and never..I repeat never ..was my glass even a 1/3 empty before replenishment.  Our waiter presented the restaurant history, the signature crab dishes and the specials like an excellent radio or TV host (would not be surprised if he wasn't a \"starving actor\")  One of our bottles of wine (and we killed several) was a little off tasting (one of our group tasted it first but missed the flavor) and they quickly (light speed) had another on our table with deepest apologies.<br><br>The crab appetizer is served perfectly cold with fresh drawn butter. We had them serve it family style in the center of the table. The forks and tongs were flying dangerously close to flesh as we all wanted to insure we got our fair share!  :-) <br><br>The Madagascar shrimp  was also excellent with sauces to die for.  <br><br>So why only four stars you ask? My entree (which sounded so great when the waiter presented it as a \"special\") was really undistinguished. It was a 6 ounce filet served \"Oscar style\" with asparagus, but the steak lacked flavor, the Bearnaise was just OK, and the Oscar was one piece of crab. <br><br>The filet lacked the quality \"steakhouse shape\" that you would expect at a high end restaurant. The unevenness of the thickness of the cut made it deliver the entire spectrum of temperature throughout the cut. I would get some medium rare (my order) but with much of the thinner ends featuring medium to medium well inconsistency with each bite i took. I was so impressed with everything else but my meal did disappoint.  <br><br>In all fairness to the restaurant I did sample my wife's halibut which was fabulous but a quick look around the table and I thought everyone who ordered the filet like me was looking disappointed.<br><br>I almost went down to 3 stars but the appetizers, service and deserts did not deserve the abuse.  I am unsure if i will return or not.

Very nice indeed.<br><br>I had dinner with my family at Joe's this past Sunday. I'm glad I made a reservation because it was packed. I'm guessing the bar area is first come, first served and fine for a quick bite. However, if you can, make a reservation so you can sit inside the dining area. It's much nicer. <br><br>For starters, my dad and I had oysters Rockefeller and the rest of my family had the stone crab claws. I'm not usually keen on eating cooked oysters (I prefer raw), but I will always eat oysters Rockefeller. I never say no to melted cheese with spinach. EVER. I can't eat crab so I don't know what the claws tasted like. I asked my sister and she tried to spare my feelings by saying they're OK but then she said, \"Sorry. I can't even lie. They taste really good. Sweet.\" So get the crab claws. <br><br>For entrees, I had the lobster roll. I was trying to decide between steak or scallops but then I saw the specials menu and picked the lobster roll. I'm glad I did.( I can't eat crab or shrimp, but I sure can eat the hell out of a lobster.) This was my first ever lobster roll. I know, I know: some might say it's sacrilege since I didn't have a proper one from New England but I live here and this was in front of me. Opportunity costs and all. <br><br>I loved it. The roll was crunchy and filled to the brim with lobster meat. I was surprised at how much lobster I got. I appreciated that there was not a lot of seasoning or herbs in the mix because that would mask the natural sweetness and flavor of the lobster. It came with sweet potato fries and a little side of coleslaw. I would definitely order that again. <br><br>I can't speak for any other entrees but everyone enjoyed their meals (mahi mahi, 16 oz. rib eye, and seared scallops). The service was great. Plates were cleared quickly and the table was scraped of crumbs after each time plates were removed. One of the best parts of the meal (besides the food) happened when the busser came to clear our appetizers. He squeezed lemon juice into our hands followed by a hot towel so we could wipe the seafood smell off our hands. Lovely. <br><br>It is a bit pricey and can get very crowded and loud.

The knife that they gave me was perfectly weighted, but seemed big and heavy enough to cut through an entire side of meat.  Then out came the three-inch thick pork chop and I understood why such an implement was needed.

While my boyfriend and I waited for the rest of our party to arrive (note: they will not seat you without your entire party) we stood in the bar and had a couple of cocktails and the fried calamari. My dirty martini and his Manhattan were both quite good. We order calamari frequently when dining at seafood restaurants, and we both agreed that this fried calamari was some of the best we'd ever had; the texture of the calamari was tender and not overcooked, and the breading was light but flavorful. I highly recommend it. They have a limited wine by the glass menu and a more extensive choice of bottles. I didn't have a problem finding a cab sauv at a reasonable price, though. <br><br>For dinner, we enjoyed the crab bisque, the King crab, filet mignon and sides of potatoes and creamed spinach. Note that the sides are a la carte and are served family style, meant to be shared and certainly big enough for 2-3 people. The King crab was the standout. If you're going to Joe's, please don't skip this. It was perfectly chilled and served with warm butter for dipping. I also loved that Joe's does most of the work for you by splitting the crab shell. The meat fell right out and there was barely any work involved. My filet was also cooked well, with a light salt and pepper seasoning. For dessert, we enjoyed the key lime pie and the banana pie with fosters sauce. If you're looking for something light to cap off the meal, go with the key lime pie. The banana pie, oppositely, is huge and very rich (but delicious also). <br><br>The restaurant was packed, even on a Wednesday night, and I've heard this is how it usually is.

Didn't get any crab bits, but the flavor made up for it.<br><br>- Stone crabs (4 pre-cracked claws)- the lemon and Joe's mustard go so well with the crab, and helps bring out the freshness and tangy-ness. These were really annoying to eat though, because I kept eating shell...<br><br>- Joe's cole slaw- not heavy mayo, tasted more like sushi vinegar, came with relish and a dollop of mayo, really, really good<br><br>- Potatoes- like hash brown, but with a really crunchy (almost burnt) crust on top, super oily and heavy<br><br>- Key lime pie-  super tangy, not too sweet, probably one of the best key lime pies I've had, it would have been perfect if they used the graham cracker crumb pie base<br><br>- Banana foster- too much whipped cream, not enough cream and bananas, also not too sweet<br><br>I really like how they do all their sides as family style, instead of individual portions. The menu was also really thoughtful.

We started with a Caesar salad and were given a choice of 9 entrees and three desserts. I opted for the ahi Asian-style and chocolate fudge pie. <br><br>My ahi was not only huge, but amazing. Seared, it came with a side of fresh wasabi, ginger and soy sauce. My first bite nearly brought me to tears; not because it was so amazing (but it was), but because fresh wasabi is so fucking strong.

I was not blown away by our food. <br>  When you are getting into a higher dining price point you expect the diners will likely be fairly decent and respectable people, but the people who were there were not what I expected. Lots of loud obnoxious sloppy drunks. It was like I was at some sort of Frat party for 50+ year olds. <br>The host would get on the mic every 15 minutes to announce a table was ready.

I understand not seating partial parties (4 out of 5 people had arrived) when the restaurant is full but when it's not it shouldn't be an issue. Also, I request a booth and you call me on the day to confirm, I should get that booth. Also, a good restaurant manager shouldn't tell you what time you'll be expected to leave, that's incredibly rude. Not only did the manager tell my mom we needed to be done eating by 8pm he tried to talk down to her. Who does that in the restaurant industry?! The only shining part of this experience was Denise T. our waitress. The food was good until I got food poisoning. I have been in and out of the bathroom all day.

I talked to the waiter and he seemed very blaise about it - asked what I wanted him to do about it? I said that he could just take them away.

The claws were pre-cracked so it was easy to get to the meat. Honestly, it was like heaven in my mouth. Chunks of fresh, dense meat in every bite. We didn't even use the horseradish mustard and just squeezed fresh lemon. My only lament was that they didn't have oysters on the half shell (they have a sister restaurant two blocks away called Shaw's that carries that). In addition to the crab claws, we also got the sampler which included king crab legs and ceviche and a shrimp cocktail. The sampler helped get a feel for their other seafood offerings, but it's the crab claws that shine. Hearing that this was our first time at Joe's Seafood, we were given a slice of key lime pie on the house, and it was divine. And I usually don't like key lime pie. Nice crust, thick, creamy filling and whipped cream to top it off.

King crab legs, split open nicely for you, served cold with drawn butter and mustard on the side.  But to be honest, the crab was so good that you didn't even need the butter or mustard.  Tender and meaty, every bite was an opportunity to revel in the perfect amount of sweetness that signified just how fresh this crab was.  Get this.  Every single time.<br><br>Bone In Rib Eye - Excellent flavor, nice big portion, this was delicious.  To be fair, I've had a good amount of steak in Chicago with all the excellent choices of restaurants.  This ranks up in the top five for how nicely the outside was caramelized, the flavors, and the perfect temperature inside for my medium rare order.  <br><br>Filet Mignon - The guest ordered is medium well, so I'm not much of a fan.  Personally, filet mignon is definitely a more tender cut, but lacks in the ability to compare to a well marbled rib eye in flavor.  But this is often the preference of women (petite filet) or men who want something less fatty and more tender.  While there was a point in my life I marveled at a perfectly tender steak, I'm finding more and more that flavor is just as important, which means filet is going to lose a lot more often nowadays.<br><br>Sweet Corn Side - Sweet corn in season, cut off the cob, lightly grilled in lime and butter.  Delicious.  Clear winner of the side dishes for me.<br><br>Mashed Potatoes - A very well made mashed potato with a good balance of smoothness and thickness.  <br>Creamed Spinach - Excellent cream spinach.  Very well made, but just couldn't compare to the corn.<br><br>Key Lime Pie - Wow.  I'm blown away by the key lime pie.  The filling itself was perfect, but I've had perfect filling before.  What blew me away was the crust... Their crust was made without over packing the graham cracker crumbs, and in large enough pieces that still gave it an excellent texture and taste.  The combination of crust and filling made this an excellent ending course.<br><br>Others:  Customer service was excellent.  Which it should be, considering I was with a big spender that was recognized by staff members, and that it's a high end restaurant with high prices.  Our server's confidence was nearing a level of cockiness that I found somewhat off putting, but his knowledge of the food and recommendations were on point.  <br><br>Verdict:  This is indeed a five star quality restaurant from a food perspective, as well as a service perspective.  That being said, it isn't cheap so there's a definite balance to be considered.  In terms of price, it's likely on par with some of the finer steak houses you would eat at in the city, but with a few items that really make it stand out.  (King Crab and Key Lime pie).  I have every intention of coming back with my wife, and perhaps some more family members... when I get a promotion at work to help cover these costs.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Awesome seafood!

Our server got a twinkle in his eye and said he knew just the thing.

A few minutes later, he carted out a tray of desserts, which we figured were for us and the table behind us. No. Every single dessert on that tray was for us (8 or 9 total) and they were all free.

We tried to walk in at 5pm on Monday thinking the restaurant would be able to accommodate a small party of three. Well, the earliest they could do was 9:30 pm so we opted for a Wednesday night reservation instead. Love the interiors of this Chicago restaurant. The bar, host stand, coat check/reservations counter are all located as you walk in. Lots of details, dark wood, leather, wrought iron chandeliers, tile ceilings - love it! The dining room is huge - again lots of the same details. Black  and white photos from the 30s through 50s (?) adorn the walls. The atmosphere is vibrant and loud - like a huge family gathering. Plates and platters find their way through the dining room giving you a peek of what looks good. The service is impeccable and spot on. I cannot find one thing to complain about. Now for the food... first bad news - no Stone Crab. Bummer. So we went ahead and ordered Calamari and Oysters Rockefeller to start. Both were very good. Calamari was nicely seasoned and fried. I ordered the 16oz Rib Eye medium rare with 3 sides to share - Crispy Onion Strings, Green Beans Amandine and Roasted Sweet Corn. My steak came to the table medium (instead of medium rare). Our server apologized and tookit back. The second one was delivered by the manager who asked me to cut through the center - medium plus. Oh dear. This time, more apologies and a round of desserts were offered with their compliments. They did ask me if there was something they could offer for the overdone steaks... Ah, Stone Crab, perhaps? :-) It would usually upset me when this happens, but the dining experience other than the entree was pretty amazing.

On my last minute trip last week, I alas walked in alone, early (around 5:30) to take my chances. They keep a few table open and I was early enough to score one. My mission this time was the stone crabs and I wanted a perfect wine to go with them...I usually go down the Chard path but the waiter suggested a white burgundy...indicating if I really didn't like it I could change. He also suggested that instead of all stone crabs, I try one from the west coast - he thought they were a little sweeter. Well, I'll be honest, I thought the crab suggestion was because it hasn't been a great season and they were short on the stone crab - but he seemed sincere (wouldn't let me get a full portion of the side I ordered - it's not on the menu but they do half orders...). The verdict?<br>The stone crab met every expectation I had (yummmmmmmmmmmmmm) and the wine suggestion was perfect (as evidenced by the 3 glasses I did end up drinking by the end of the meal - 2 is usually all I ever do). And the west coast cousin of the stone crab? I ended up ordering 2 more after I finished my initial serving. Holy smokes - I'm not usually a big eater but they were fabulous - I just couldn't help myself. (Truly - if I'd been with someone, I might have been embarrassed at my gluttony). And the side dish I ordered (leek casserole thingy)...was finished off!  <br>Well and then, that wine - so I ordered the 3rd glass...and how do you sit at an empty table alone just drinking wine? I'm sure it's not that difficult, but the table looked empty so I ordered dessert. I got the Boston creme pie - I was having a comfort food craving I guess. It came with a thick covering of I'm sure wonderful chocolate, but I'm not not a chocoholic, so I took that off and just at the cake/cream...and swooshed it through the chocolate sauce that was swirled around the plate. It doesn't rate up there with the rest of the meal but it was perfectly fine, particularly as I enjoyed my final glass of white burgundy.<br>So my server was spot on with his suggestions and was attentive enough making my solo meal comfortable and enjoyable.<br>(oh and ps to the guy sitting at the table talking about Trading Places.....I think you underestimated how really young your co-workers were.........but I loved that movie when I was trading in Chicago.)", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "It is by little coincidence that a venture to Joe's Seafood & Steak was partaken during my Chicago Steak Adventures. Having been disappointed on two prior occasions at different establishments, the third attempt would be the final accolade in this expedition. Having been recommended to attend Joe's by a long time steak affectionate, that resided in Chicago since his existence. A venture to this highly acclaimed establishment is not to be missed. <br><br>The Ambiance: Despite the over-the-top decadence that sets as the decor of Joe's, the timely romantic yet quaint charm of the establishment produces both a welcoming and sophisticated feel. At first entry into the main dining room, patrons will be embraced by the upscale setup of the decor. Luscious velvet white table clothe sets the tone to the tranquil and sophisticated feel of the dining room. The white table clothe is further enhanced by the dark mahogany wood panels of the wall decor. To further aid in the romantic ambiance, the sublet tungsten fluorescent lighting that's accompanied by the lowly lit table candles provides the upscale yet modest feel of a more modern high end steakhouse. <br><br>The Service: Our server (Shirley) should receive an abundance of praise for her dedication in providing both attention and service during the dining experience. Everything ranging from the wine recommendation, notable offerings, and portion sizes were commented on with incredibly resolve and accuracy. Furthermore, Shirley's ability to communicate with us provided the insight that allowed for us to further appreciate the experience. <br><br>The Food... <br><br>Appetizer 1 - Crab Cake w/ Spicy Aioli: The application is a simple Jumbo Lump Crab Cake that's deep fried and served with a side of Spicy Aioli. At first bite, the meatiness derived from the Jumbo Lump Crab Meat is the main staple of this consumable. Luscious and generous offerings of the crab meat were evident in each bite. Patrons will also find that the mildly seasoned crunchy exterior of the application provided the subtle flavor contrast to enhancing the buttery flavor of the crab meat. <br><br>Appetizer 2 - Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail: A basic application of a Shrimp Cocktail served with a side of Cocktail Sauce. There was nothing memorable about this application other than the simplistic but welcoming contrast between the sweetness of the Shrimp and the mild acidity from the cocktail sauce. An overall enjoyable appetizer <br><br>Entree - 22oz Bone-In NY Aged NY Strip: Cooked to a perfect medium rare temperature, the NY Strip Steak contained a perfect contrast from the charred exterior and the juicy flavors within the meat. At first bite, patrons will find that the rawhide meatiness of the application is the most notable detection. The perfect abundance of marbling from the aged steak provided the additional flavoring. What's most important in this application is the cooking temperature. At a perfect medium rare, the meat contained a perfect textural contrast stemming from the charred exterior that provided the welcoming tenderness of the pink interior. No steak sauce is required for consumption; the mild salt seasoning combined from the juices stemming from the steak's abundance of marbling distribution is the foundation for the steak's invigorating flavors. <br><br>Side Dish 1 - Macaroni & Cheese: Perhaps the excessive use of a certain bitter cheese was one fault in the execution of this dish. Of course, there was also the excessive cheese sauce that rested as the foundation. Nevertheless, the breadcrumb toppings provided a nice seasoning and textural contrast to the soft al dente body of the macaroni. The semi-bitter cheese sauce provided a stark boldness to the application. Although the extra reduction of the sauce would further enhance the richness of the application, the slightly watery sauce tainted what could be an abundance of bold and invigorating bites. <br><br>Side Dish 2 - Steamed Broccoli w/ a Garlic Butter Sauce: As simple as it sounds, the Broccoli was steamed to perfection. The Garlic Butter Sauce provided a rich flavor that didn't hinder the earthiness of the Broccoli. Such an accompaniment allowed for a perfect balance of the rich steak, with an earthy alternative. <br><br>Dessert - Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie: To end en evening of gluttonous consumption by an overwhelming dessert is one that's offered only at Steakhouses. The Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie was a decadence of flavors. From first consumption, the mild sweetness derived from the Graham Cracker Crust mellows in introduction of the semisweet mild chocolate sauce in this application. The rich and velvety flavors of the peanut butter work to engulf all other elements by providing a decadent exertion of succulent nuttiness. <br><br>Notes on Joe's: <br>- $100 Per Person (after tax & tip) <br>- Order \"half\" portions of side dishes.

You MUST make a reservation or you are going to be spending an hour or two waiting for a table (Not that it isn't worth it...but still why wait?). Since going there the first time we have made a tradition every year of going on Christmas Eve. I made a mistake the first year and waited until the beginning of November to make a reservation - and then I was informed that all reservations for xmas eve were gone by the first week of October. So I called back every other day for 3 weeks and finally was able to steal a cancellation (it was basically a Christmas miracle). Last year, (having learned from my mistake), I stalked OpenTable every day starting in September to see when I could make a reservation for Christmas Eve. The reservations only go out so far but they are updated every day and so I checked and waited until that wonderful day when December 24th became available and made my reservation!<br>The food tastes like heaven - Lobster is always cooked to perfection - I could just sit at one of their tables and eat Lobster every day if I had the chance. Mac & Cheese is excellent as is the Creamed Spinach - But in actuality I have tried most of the sides and I have never had one that wasn't a religious experience. The Boston Cream Pie is just phenomenal - it's like someone imagined what the perfect food experience would be and then baked that pie. <br>If you live in the city and haven't been to this place...what are you waiting for?<br>If you are visiting you have to go...you just DO...you will not regret it", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Had dinner here with a small group.

I made a reservation here about 2 weeks ago about the birthday and engagement we're celebrating. Our server wasn't really paying attention to us since he's got a party of about 12-14 people next to our table. Seems like he's struggling keeping up with all of the tables, I understand that, but the establishment he's working we expect more. I had to tell him we're ready to order our main entree. After our meal is done, he did show the dessert menu, but we decided to not get any. After that he just turned around and gave us the check like he was in a hurry to get rid of us. Before I paid, I went back to the front to ask the host if there's a note on the reservation I made 2 weeks ago. He said yes, so I told him our server just handed our bill and we're paying it now, but nothing is said about the birthday now the engagement we're celebrating. Really disappointed that this is not communicated properly and felt like we were being rush to eat and leave. Not a single manager came to our table to apologized.

To be a bit snarky, I live near San Francisco, so I was not prepared to acknowledge that this was the best crab louis I have ever had.  Dungeness crab is considered a symbol of  San Francisco cuisine and this crab salad outdid any I have had anywhere on the west coast.  I have loved crab louis from my younger years and have had plenty of gooey mayonnaised versions.  This dressing was so balanced and enhanced, rather than covered over, the fresh taste of the crab.  In fact, it was a visit to the west coast that introduced me to my love of crab louis.  To come back home and find this wonderful version in my old backyard tickled me.  I also like key lime pie and found this version to be very good.  <br><br>In addition, this restaurant had a very good glass of chardonnay and we liked the cocktail we had.  (Chicago knows its cocktails ;-)  )   However, another big plus dining here, are the gluten free menu choices.  My guest with celiac had the best lunch where flavor was not compromised at all with delicious choices.  In fact, they don't \"cheat\" on their recipes adding flour where it isn't necessary to smooth sauces or whatever.  In fact, that gluten free brownie was excellent!   If I could have handled that much food three days in a row......LOL<br><br>In short, my next trip to Chicago will include this restaurant for sure.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I had some of the best filet mignon here I got it medium rare and it was delicious. my friend had some of their crab legs so I tried his and there was no complaints at out table.

Small, crisp on the outside and juicy inside; they were perfectly cooked.<br>For the main course we had an order of Jumbo and an order of Large Stone Crabs, a couple of broiled tomatoes and hash browns. Basically the same order we get in Miami.<br>We also ordered a bottle of overpriced French Chablis, but since it was a couple of days after Christmas we decided to indulge. Nothing like crisp chilled Chablis to accompany the Stone Crabs.<br>This is where any comparison to the Miami location comes to a grinding halt.<br>The sommelier poured the wine and put the bottle in a communal ice bucket. We drank most of our first glass with the scallops and then the waitress poured our second glass. I didn't pay much attention to the bottle but when I tasted the wine I could tell it was not my Chablis. I called the waitress over and she showed me the bottle and sure enough it was a Pinot Grigio. She said it belonged to the table next to us who were having dessert and proceeded to get us new glasses and pour our Chablis. There was no apology and worse than that she never explained to the other table what had happened. They were out two full glasses of their wine. Of course, this left me wondering \"what if she had poured some other table two glasses of my wine?\"<br>The entrees came out. Unlike in Miami, they do not automatically offer you a bib with the Stone Crabs. I'm sure if you asked, you could get one. The broiled tomatoes were cold and the hash browns were lukewarm. The Jumbo Stone Crabs were a little mushy. The Large Stone Crabs were excellent. It has now been an hour since we ordered. Although we were not in a rush, we were hungry. We did not send the tomatoes or hash browns back to get them warmed up. I hate sending something back, almost finishing your main entrée, and eating the sides by themselves.<br>The waiters are very bellicose and love to tell stories about themselves.

No. Just hungry.<br><br>So on to the next....dining at Joe's is a real treat.  Stone crabs are delicious and once you know the history, you feel privileged partaking of these south Florida delicacies.

I've been here for both work dinners and personal dinners, weekends and weeknights, and it's always consistent, which is a plus on their behalf.<br><br>My latest trip was on a Saturday evening at 6:30pm. I had made a reservation a few months out, as this place is always bustling and there is always a wait if you don't have a reservation. We checked in with the host and checked our coats (which is complimentary) as they prepared our table. We were promptly seated and greeted by our waiter who ran down the specials of the evening for us and took our drink order. Shortly thereafter he came back with our first round of drinks and we placed an order for an appetizer. For our drinks we decided to stray from wine and explore the cocktail list. I opted for their whiskey smash which was a little sweet for my taste, but for $11 it was pretty boozy and is on the cheaper end for cocktails when compared to other options in the city. My boyfriend went for their Rye Manhattan, which was your typical run of the mill Manhattan with a boozy brandied cherry. As we were sipping on our cocktails, our colossal lump crab cake arrived and we dove right on in. As many other reviews have mentioned, the crap cake is mostly crab versus the filler of other establishments. It was tasty, but it could have used a little more spice/flavor as it was lacking something crucial that I've tasted in other crab cake offerings.<br><br>After we polished off the crab cake, our waiter came back and took our order. We both decided to get the petite filet mignon with the Alaskan King Crab legs. I ordered my steak medium and my boyfriend went with medium rare. We opted out of the sides and went with a split vegetable chopped salad instead. When our entrees arrived we were surprised to have lobster tail instead of the King Crab legs, to which our waiter was puzzled about when we pointed this out. He had us put our steaks on our salad plates, and whisked away the lobster tail, muttering his apologies. We cut into our steaks as we waited for our King Crab to arrive, and I noticed that my medium steak was closer to a medium-well, which was disappointing. When our waiter came back with the crab, he set them down and walked away, not even asking how our steaks were. This was a huge turn off service wise, as I would have pointed out that my steak was not cooked to a proper temperature. Regardless, I was happy to munch on the sweet and buttery crab legs as my consolation prize. The portion size on the crab is substantial at four large pieces, so between that and the steak, I was more than satiated.  Now, onto the chopped salad. This was one of the most sorry excuses I have ever seen for a chopped salad. Sure, the vegetables were fresh, but they were boring. The dressing was watery and flavorless, the cheese was muted in flavor, and there was absolutely no seasoning to the salad. What a letdown.<br><br>Now, onto the most depressing dessert ever. We ordered the peanut butter chocolate fudge pie, and what showed up was something I could have made in elementary school. The filling was simply whipped peanut butter in an oreo cookie shell that you could buy pre-made at the grocery store. For $8 this was an absolute joke and was reminiscent of a pudding pie. Totally uninspired and totally lacking for a steak house dessert.<br><br>After this trip to Joe's I definitely won't be back on my own dime.

Well guess what buddy, I may not look like David Beckham, but I do have something I am sure you do not have, a real HUGE personality!

Maybe it is because I am from Seattle, but their stone crab tasted like they came from a cut rate Vegas buffet, I mean seriously, I was expecting a food experience since this was their big thing, it was such a let down... A very expensive let down, I think the 6 crab claws cost us something like $34 dollars!?! I will say, the saving grace was the calamari, it was in the top 3 of best fried calamari we had.<br><br>I was actually a little full at this time, but I was really craving their Cesar salad since it was \"house made\", also, I did not want anything too big since I knew we would be getting desert, therefore I ordered the Cesar salad for two for myself, and my wife ordered the Ahi Tuna. The waiter appeared very annoyed that I ordered the salad; I think he was a little worried about his bottom line.... I asked if they make the salad tableside, he stated that they did not; I found this a little strange for a steakhouse, but no biggie. I went on to ask if they make it traditionally with the egg yolk and sardines, he told me they do and asked if I wanted sardines on top. I said I will take it however they make it, I trust the chef. He then said \"Sooo you don't want any anchovies?\" I then replied \"I want it exactly how the chef makes it, if that includes anchovies on top then great, if it does not then fine, if it is used strictly in the dressing then make it that way\". Next came the eye roll, he said \"I thought you wanted anchovies on it?\" I am so annoyed at him, seriously, what is the deal with this guy? I told him \"I was only curious as to whether this was made the traditional way or if they had their own twist, please just bring it to me as it comes\". He lets out a big sigh and annoyingly says \"uhhhh okay...\" He kept eyeing my wife in such a way to say \"who is this guy\" my wife was not pleased.<br><br>Our food comes and we were appalled, my salad for two was more like a salad for one and it was underdressed and the Romaine tasted like it had a little dirt on it/not properly washed. Maybe the guy was annoyed about the salad because he knew it was so small and tasted bad? Their dressing tasted like it came out of a store bought bottle, it was very disappointing. And my wife's seared Ahi had no care or attention given to it. The sear was majorly uneven and their marinade/sauce it came with was inedible, sweet like candy syrup? The food was such a letdown. <br><br>This guy totally was acting like he was not going to get a good tip because we did not order drinks and did not accept his recommendations for their 3 most expensive items, however, our bill was still $140 dollars, I so did not want to tip this guy well, because he treated me like trash, but I did anyways, only 20% not the 30% we normally tip. I am assuming we just went at the worst day during their worst year with their worst waiter, there is no way this place is in general as bad as the experience we had, however, the downside is I will never step foot in another Joe's again, nor will I recommend it to anyone.

The lobster bisque sounds better than it actually tastes. Don't expect to find large pieces of lobster in it. Salad however is excellent, as they offer many unique dressings all of which are delicious. <br><br>I am a HUGE fan of all of their side dishes and appetizers, especially the oysters Rockefeller, Jennie's potatoes, and hashed browns. Even if you do not like oysters, you will love the oysters Rockefeller guaranteed. <br><br>In terms of the steak, I would say it is simply above average and not excellent. I recently ordered the rib eye based on the waiters strong recommendation (side note: he looked like he was near orgasm as he was describing the taste of the steak) and I was not impressed. While it was cooked according to my specifications, the taste just wasn't there and I felt it was not up to par with what I would normally expect from a place like Joe's. The seasoned salt was probably the best part about the steak and I would've been pretty disappointed without it. A high quality steak should taste great on its own and seasonings should simply be an added bonus. I can honestly say I can make a better steak at home for a 1/4 of the price if not less. I imagine their stone crab is probably the way to go based on other people's reviews...<br><br>The desert is out of this world, especially the chocolate peanut butter pie and key lime pie - nothing beats it, but I'm sure it comes with a 4,000 calorie per slice price tag. <br><br>Awkward transition but nothing screams you are in a high quality restaurant like super thick disposable napkins in the bathroom and state of the art splash guards in the urinal.

In short, everything about this place exudes excellence. The steaks and seafood are among the best I've had anywhere, and the service was simply outstanding.<br><br>First on our list was a pair of steaks -- a filet mignon and a 16 oz dry-aged NY strip. The filet was buttery soft on the inside and perfectly charred on the outside with a mild, velvety taste that's expected when a filet is cooked to a perfect medium-rare. The NY strip - at 16oz  - was substantial enough to feed two persons, yet I managed to consume about 3/4 of it after devouring half of the filet. The strip was also a perfect medium-rare with a nice crisp crust on the outside. I uploaded a photo of this wonderful steak for all to see.<br><br>Next on the list was a full order the of king crab legs. These are cracked and prepped table-side and served with drawn butter; all that's required is for you to lift out the meat and enjoy with the butter and lemon. King crab legs are a wonderful thing and I probably don't need to go into detail about how good these are, only to say that these were the most flavorful I've had in recent memory. Amongst the group we split orders of the macaroni and cheese and creamed spinach. Since I was mostly occupied devouring the proteins, I had very little of the sides, but they were both quite good.<br><br>By now the group was stuffed, but this was a special night out for us so we went all in and ordered a pair of desserts: slices of Boston cream pie and banana cream pie. The Boston cream pie has a nice richness-to-lightness ratio and it held together very nicely, unlike at some other places where the cake falls apart after a few bites. The banana cream pie was sweet in its own right with perfect cream topping. <br><br>Overall, I left extremely full but also 100% satisfied with the food and service. Back home in Los Angeles I have an abundance of top-rate steak and seafood choices, but I can say with confidence that Joe's has topped my list, and when I return I will certainly pay another visit.

The host & order takers all dressed in their tuxedos, service impeccable and the decor richly decorated..... Stone crabs are easy to cooked/steamed and cracked so nothing extraordinary about them!  Since not much effort is involved in the cooking/cracking processed, I would call their stone crab average. The petit filet mignon are petit ... Perfect for a small eater. Their specialty is the bone-in steaks and so we tried the boned-in New York strip. So looking forward to the steak and while cooked perfectly - medium rare - we were disappointed with how Joe ruined the steaks with their very salty ground pepper + spice rub. We could not finish the steak b/c it was way too salty! The best entree was the dole sole presented to us in a nice filleted presentation. The fish was perfectly cook!  Not much to steaming the green beans and brocollini  either. the key lime pie was good but nothing out of the ordinary. I suppose that if we spend $50+ on a steak!

We had an 8pm reservation and were a few minutes late, but they seated us right away. The place was packed, and thank goodness for a coat check, because once you enter the dining room section, you'll see that there is zero room for anything besides yourself and a tiny purse. <br>It looks like your typical steakhouse institution, which isn't exactly my favorite style, but it was ok. The ceilings were a bit low, and coupled with the fact that the tables are so close to each other that the poor servers have very little room to do their job, I felt a bit claustrophobic. I also got elbowed in the back twice by the server for the booth behind me. <br><br>Anyway! Besides all that, let's talk about the food. There were two options to choose from: <br><br>1) Alaskan King Crab <br>Your choice of an All Greens Salad, <br>a bowl of Chowder or Bisque, <br>1 lb. Alaskan King Crab Legs, <br>Hashed Brown Potatoes, <br>Joe's Cole Slaw and Key Lime Pie<br><br>2) Filet Mignon <br>Your choice of an All Greens Salad, <br>a bowl of Chowder or Bisque, <br>8 oz. Filet Mignon, Jennie's Potatoes, <br>Joe's Grilled Tomato and Banana Cream Pie <br>with Fosters Sauce<br><br>3 went with the King Crab dinner, and 2 with the Filet Mignon. Our server (whose name I can't remember) was the sweetest thing. She was happy that we knew about the special menu, gave it to us gladly, and also told us about the other specials of the evening. When she took our dinner order, she also let us know that we could switch sides between the specials if we wanted to. Which was good, since those with the King Crab orders all hated cole slaw. <br><br>I had the Filet Mignon, bisque, mashed potatoes, grilled tomato... and for dessert, the Banana Cream Pie. The bisque was good, and served very nicely - poured at the table. I will say that my steak was done perfectly. The other person who got the filet wasn't as happy with theirs. It was kind of cold and a tiny portion (for a 6'2\" guy). Since we all got the same sides, our server brought us regular-sized sides to share at the table. We also ordered asparagus. She dished our sides for us, which was really nice. The mashed potatoes were soooo good! Cheesy, with some breadcrumbs for texture. Really good. The grilled tomato - not so much. I would've been very happy with a simple grilled tomato. But this one had a layer of creamed spinach on top and some cheese. The cheese looked like (and tasted like) a Kraft single. Maybe some Gruyere please? The asparagus were fine. <br><br>Those who got the King Crab were very happy with it - huge portion! I tried a piece from my sister. It was very good and quite fresh. <br><br>For dessert, the other 4 got the Key Lime Pie, and I got the Banana Cream Pie. We also ordered the Havana Dream pie.... let me tell you, it was dreamy, divine, decadent. We were happy with our desserts from the special.... but that Havana Dream pie is what would bring us back to Joe's - JUST for that dessert. It's a Cuban version of the Tres Leches cake, so not as soaked as the Mexican version. It had almost a custardy cheesecake texture to it - absolutely delicious. <br><br>I may not go back to Joe's for dinner, but I sure will sit in the bar for a drink and a piece of that pie! <br><br>Sidenote: Before dining at Joe's, please go to the restroom. And don't drink too much while you're there either... because the restrooms are ridiculously TINY. For a restaurant of decent size, with I'd say like 200 customers at a time, they really need a bigger restroom. As I pushed the door open to enter, I hit the lady waiting \"in line\" right outside the stall. There are 2 stalls and a tiny sink.

They sucked! Seriously, this is a complete scam! HORRIBLE! We did try some of our friend's scallops and shrimp. Now, these were awesome! For entrees, I had the 16 oz. bone in filet. WOW! GREAT FLAVOR, but, I ordered it med. rare, and it came out medium. This was a complaint with everyone in our party, but we didn't say anything, as the server never (not once) asked how our food was. Wifey had the petite filet, which was good, but not nearly as tender or flavorful as the bone in filet.<br><br>All in all, due to the FOH's arrogant demeanor, and the fact they screwed up my wife's surprise party, I'll refuse to ever go back. The service was good, but he never asked how our food was. The food was good, but not great.

well worth it, and it was the only thing we wound up needing to take home (and even then, there wasn't much left).<br><br>And then came dessert.  I specifically made sure to leave room because of the rave reviews I'd heard about the banana cream pie and especially the key lime pie.  And as we prepared to order, the waitstaff came by with a brownie sundae and a little candle.  My girlfriend was initially amazed that they linked my offhand comment while ordering the 2nd Mortgage to bringing out something for my birthday, but I reminded her that I put down it was my birthday when making the reservation.  Even so, we still ordered one of each of those pies.  That was what did us in.  The brownie mixed with hot fudge and ice cream was nice, and just as we finished, out came our pies.  She had the key lime (and I had a few bites) and I went with banana cream (and she had a few bites).<br><br>If I had to do it again, I'd have gotten the key lime as well, because it was knee-collapsingly awesome.  If you've ever seen the show Dexter on Showtime, you'll know when I say that THIS is the Key Lime Pie he was likely looking for.  Best I've ever had.  The banana cream was good, but it needed more of that awesome Foster sauce to make it truly stand out above other better-than-decent banana cream pies I've had in the past.<br><br>In the end, I can't give them 5 stars.  I'd like to, but the price tag just gets stuck in my throat and I can't do it.  Aside from the sides we got, everything else was either overly-priced or underly-portioned.  Before the shoveling of onions at the end of entree time and then the desserts, I was a little upset over being not-so-full.  If we were to visit again, our appetizer would instead be one of their soups (that I'm told is a little more filling) or something else that cost less than our sampler and comes with more food.  My entree would instead be just a steak (bigger) and still have sides and dessert to make sure I was full.<br><br>But yes, we will likely go again.  Next time I get a gift card...", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Joe's is like the person you can never say no to and why would you??  This place speaks for itself!  I haven't eaten anything here that I didn't like (lobster tails, creamed corn, mashed potatoes, stone crab) but the absolute best is the alaskan king crab!!  The sweet succulent taste is so mesmerizing that you will go home, dream about it and leave you craving for more!  I absolutely love this place!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The second mortgage was good...but I wish we would have just got more stone crab.

I found the offerings here delectable. It came with cervice, a crab claw, a cocktail shrimp, and a cocktail lobster. Two dipping sauces. I have never had stone crab, and i found this so dammed tasty. Plump, sweet, wow. Even with all the work involved in eating it.  The shrimp and lobster were also delectable. The cervice was some of the best I ever tasted. It was all very fresh. Oh yes, that cocktail sauce had really the perfect amount of horseradish in it. <br><br>Their bread basket is even noteworthy. Onion rolls with onion on the inside! So tasty! <br><br>We were given hot towels, which felt a little odd, but I suppose a classy night out should not involve your hands smelling like crab juice, but I am no expert on this. <br><br>One thing that I think should be noted here, whenever the staff came around to clean the table, they used one of those crumb scraper do dads. Aaron and I laughed a little about that, because we recently saw an episode of \"Check Please\" where a reviewer was complaining about having to sit at a crumby table all night, so no crumbly tables at Joe's! <br><br>Dinner came out shortly after, we both had the \"Steak and Tails\" We also got fries, and onion strings as a side.

The tails, were also fab, I was surprised to that they were cooked grilled, and the standard which is boiled. They were super flavorful and sweet. (They also give you drawn butter mmmm butter....) The onion strings were awesome. They were even more awesome when used to soak up stake juice. The fries were fresh cut but pretty typical, they had fresh sea salt on the table for them though! I really liked that. <br><br>After dinner the waitress brought a brownie with ice cream and fudge on it, and a candle on top, to wish Aaron a happy birthday. Really nice service touch there, they noted it in his reservation that it was for his birthday. After we ordered both the key lime pie and the banana cream pie. It was really the best key lime pie i have ever tasted. I think if Dexter were real, this would have been the key lime pie he was looking for.

It was the stuff in the middle that's dragging down the rating a bit.<br><br>I ordered off the Restaurant Week menu (extended through March) and got the King Crab Legs option. The crab legs came out completely pre-cracked, which was actually a bit disappointing because there was no work involved--just lift up the shell and eat the meat. That might be a pro to most people, but I like the challenge when it comes to crab legs. The legs were also huge--again, not sure if this is supposed to be a pro, but I find the smaller ones have a sweeter, more delicate flavor, which was lacking most of in these.<br><br>The sides were downright bad. It came with 'hash brown potatoes' which was just squares of potatoes smushed into a half-moon--nice crispy outside, but no flavor to speak of except in the accompanying mustard dipping sauce. It also came with a 'coleslaw salad' which I guess was deconstructed because it came with a dollop of mayo and pickle relish on top of some shredded cabbage. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to mix it or what--one bite and done--just tasted like pickles.<br><br>The ambiance was good--I was sitting in the bar area so it was pretty lively (even on a Monday night). Nice decor and music. The only thing that was a bit distracting was the host calling names over the mic in a way that reminded me a bit of a game show (you know, \"come on down!\").<br><br>So, the bisque and pie get 5 stars, the crab gets 3, and the sides get 2.

Not overly dressed, it is was a great starter.  I had a bone in NY strip, dry aged Prime beef, perfectly cooked with a nice crisp crust, just the right amount of fat, and mouthfuls of beefy goodness. Creamed spinach was creamy and nutmeggy and mashed potatoes have a nice crunchy top. With a steak, 1 order of sides is plenty to share for 2-3 people.

Now, onto the food.<br><br>Joe's is especially known for it's stone crab, but also for other seafood and prime steaks. We learned that Florida stone crabs' claws regenerate (into an even bigger claw) if they're removed. So, basically, they're caught, a claw is removed, they're thrown back in the ocean and their claw regenerates. People eat the removed claw. They come in 3 sizes at Joe's. I'm not a big fan of crab, so we didn't try them, but they're super popular and all the diners around us had stone crab. <br><br>For an appetizer we had the Caesar salad. You can choose an individual salad or a salad for 2. We had the one for 2. For dinner, I had the Petite Filet Mignon and my bf had the Filet and Lobster. We chose baked potato and steamed asparagus for the sides (everything is a la carte). The asparagus comes with a lemon butter sauce on the side that is really tasty...not only did I put it on the asparagus, but the potato, too! Both of our steaks were cooked perfectly and according to my bf, the lobster \"melted in your mouth.\"<br><br>We didn't order dessert, but were surprised with a complimentary key lime pie, Joe's Specialty. It was so incredibly good. It was creamy and tart and had the best homemade graham cracker crust. Joe's also has an extensive wine list and a full bar.<br><br>My only complaint is that we were seated at a very small table for 2 that was in a row with several other 2-tops. I understand they are trying to maximize the number of tables they can seat, but it was very uncomfortable to be able to fully hear the conversations going on  on both sides of us. I could have easily reached over and grabbed food off of the tables next to me. Additionally, the ambiance is a bit outdated and lackluster. I will definitely return, but I will ask for a booth or a larger table next time!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Ate lunch here on my last day in Chicago and what treat!

We ordered the stone crab appetizer (if the market price wasn't so high, we would have ordered the largest dish possible!), the stuffed spinach mushrooms, and the seafood variety dish. I am not sure of the exact title of this dish, but it had shrimp, calamari, and a couple of other things... At any rate, the quality of the food was superb. I have never tasted such fresh, clean seafood in my life! On top of that the stuffed mushrooms were out of this world. Cooked to perfection with just the right amount of cheese and butter for added flavor. We also ordered the Jennie's Potatoes, which I would strongly recommend for any starch lover. Loads of cheese and bread crumbs, bursting with flavor. Yum yum yum! <br><br>For dessert, our server suggested the key lime pie. We were too full to eat it at the restaurant, so we ordered a slice to go. WOW! The flavor was amazing, and the crust was perfect.

But after eating here a number of times I've found that the food and the service are a little inconsistent. While everybody is very polite, I've seen Joe's screw up orders a couple of times. They will acknowledge and fix their mistake, but it should never happen with this kind of frequency at a restaurant this expensive. They could stand to be a little quicker to remove these screw-ups from your bill, too.<br><br>As a steakhouse, Joe's is good but not exceptional. Their bone-in steaks are the best options; the other cuts are just okay. For these prices, you're better off buying a steak at a nice butcher shop and asking me to grill it for you. <br><br>The bulk of their seafood menu has some excellent options, like the blue nose grouper or the red snapper. But there are some mediocre dishes here as well so be careful what you order. The waiters will all tell you that everything is \"excellent\" but so did the guy who sold weed in my dorm in college.<br><br>Joe's really stands out for two things. First, the stone crabs (surprised, right?). This is their specialty and is the reason to eat here. Although expensive, they are absolutely delicious and better than any crabs you've ever had (especially those ones). Don't bother coming to Joe's if you're too cheap to get the stone crabs. Better yet, come on your office expense account so you can get righteous and not worry about the bill. That's what I do and I get the jumbo (\"market price\") every time.<br><br>Second, Joe's has kick-ass deserts so save room (which won't be hard if you order the wrong thing). The peanut butter pie is my favorite, but everything from the apple pie to the key lime pie rocks the house that rocks the body. If you ask, Joe's will kindly give you half-sizes so you can get a couple of desserts and try everything, fatty.<br><br>Finally, they have the slowest valet here of all time.

I ate their last night with my girlfriend and her aunt and uncle. The place was completely jammed, and their was a large group of people in the bar area waiting it out in hopes of a \"no-show.\" We had 6:30 reservations and were seated promptly. Unfortunately, we were seated in a booth instead of a table, but I knew I would I live.<br><br>Our waiter showed up soon after we were seated with the menus,  and the busboy was right behind him with the waters and the bread. The bread was pretty good, but the cinnamon raisin was by far the best... too bad their was only one of them for four people to split. For appetizers, we ordered the highly touted Stone Crab Claws, the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms, and the Fried Calamari. In my opinion, the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms were the best of the appetizers, and they were so well done that the layer of cheese on top of the mushrooms was not necessary. I actually removed the cheese from my mushrooms so I could fully enjoy the spinach flavor.  The fried calamari was perfectly fried, but on \"par\" with what you would expect from a high-end steakhouse. Now comes the shocker, the Crab Claws, were, in my opinion, just OK. I know some people will scoff at the suggestion that Joe's Crab Claws were not the Holy Grail, but I have had better, and I do not think I would order them the next time I go to Joe's... the high price doesn't help their case either. <br><br>My only real complaint about Joe's was created at this point in the meal. Our busboy was overly aggressive, and a bit bothersome. He was insistent about removing plates from the table and actually took our appetizer plates from the table before we had finished all of the food! Yes, we had stopped eating for a minute or so to converse, but I had been eyeing those last two mushrooms only to seem them swept off the table, by what can only be described as the Terminator of BusBoys... his mission, confiscate anything and everything! This gentleman was so insistent on dumping water into our glasses that, not once did he do so without spilling water all over the table... excuse me and I apologize work once or twice, but he was just reciting them in order to seem proper. He also leaned his entire body over our table to reach the still half full bread basket and plates on the other side. I know he is just doing his job, but I could have done without the table being shaken like a 50lb weight just fell on it, and even more so, without his body all over my clean dinner plate and silverware. Maybe I am just being picky, but at a restaurant of this caliber, I do not expect that type of service. Anyway, he did not take away from the rest of the night, so that is enough about him.<br><br>Now onto the highlight of the meal, STEAK! My girlfriend ordered the Petite Fillet, her steakhouse standard, her uncle ordered the NY Strip, her aunt, who gives up meat for lent, was forced to forgo a steak, and of course, I went with my steakhouse standard, and ordered the NY Strip - Medium Rare. We ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes, Sweet Potato Fries, and Sauteed Garlic Spinach as our sides. All of the sides were wonderful and the Fried Green Tomatoes were a fantastic surprise... we only ordered them because we have never scene them on a menu before. The Sweet Potato Fries had a brown sugar, and nutmeg (I think it was nutmeg) sprinkle over them that made them addicting.  The Sauteed Spinach was perfectly done, and in my opinion, a much better accompaniment then its creamed counterpart. What can I say about the steaks, they were all perfect. There comes a point when you realize Prime Cut Steaks are, well, Prime Cut Steaks, and that is what the majority of top-tier steakhouses serve. However, the rub/seasoning at Joe's, combined with their cooking method (absolutely perfect char to the steaks) made my NY Strip one of the best I have had. I did need a moment or two to recharge my appetite before I could finish my steak, but I made sure to wield my very large steak knife, just in case  our busboy was going to try anything funny.<br><br>I did not eat dessert because I gave that up for lent, but our table ordered a piece of the Key Lime Pie and a piece of the Boston Cream Pie, both looked and were described as, very good. <br><br>Joe's is a great steakhouse... It has a lively atmosphere, and the food to justify the hard to get reservations. For anyone who lives in or near Chicago, it is a must try. It's also perfect for someone looking to impress visitors.

The bartenders were nice and had great suggestions. For example I ordered the green salad with Joe's vinaigrette but the bartender gave me the creamy italian along with the vinaigrette and I am glad he did that.  Joe's vinaigrette was more like a sweet salsa while the creamy Italian was more like a mustard vinaigrette.  One reviewer said the bloody mary was great so I ordered it. It came with the typical celery stick, but I was pleasantly surprised by the blue cheese stuffed olive and shrimp that was attached to the drink.  This was one of the best bloody marys I've ever had.  I ordered the filet mignon with select stone crab claws.  I got the medium well which had very little pink in the center.  I would order the medium next time for a juicier steak.  My hubby ordered the bone in filet mignon and he gives it an 8 out of 10 rating.  He ordered it rare and it was cooked perfectly.  Their wine list is concise but perfect.  I highly recommend the 2008 Ken Wright pinot nior which is fantastic. Their mark up for the wines was <br>reasonable.  We paid $108 for a wine which would have cost $80 at a wine store.   That may seem a lot but I'm from NYC so I'm used to ridiculous mark ups.  Their creamed spinach and roasted corn side were also great and were the perfect size for side dishes.  We were too stuffed for dessert  but the blueberry pie looked really good.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Very good.

After all is said and done, it's a chain. Which means it will look, feel and taste the same in Vegas.

The bathroom was too tight and I had to wait and pray that the door wouldn't hit me. Compared to Shaw's, the menu is really not very expansive. I went for the mahi mahi, which was described as having a \"herbacious sauce\" accompaniment plus jicama slaw. Well, the slaw was the most interesting thing on the plate. The mahi was a little dry and underseasoned for my taste. The sauce was like a green wig. It added some color but had nothing to do with taste. We were scolded a couple of times for wanting to keep our bread dishes and butter on the table (\"We usually do things in stages,\" we were told) and had to ask for more bread (Really?

Joe's serves traditional American cuisine (with a few twists like the Asian-inspired sashimi-grade black cod in a miso-terriyaki glaze that is simply the best fish dish ever created by man or God) and serves it perfectly. The staff takes extreme care in searching out the best possible ingredients from anywhere in the world as seasonal availability allows. While US Prime steaks are always available and delicious, frequent visitors will watch the exotic specials change with the seasons from Madagascar shrimp, to never frozen Alaskan King Crab Legs, then again to Dover Sole, and, of course, fresh Florida Stone Crabs from October through May. Despite prices that could reasonably considered high, the quality of the ingredients used combined with generous portions and consistently excellent preparation make Joe's a great value (though to be fair, the wine is a tad on the high side, but not nearly as bad as many competitors.)<br><br>Executive Chef Gary Baca is almost always at the restaurant, for both lunch and dinner, and tirelessly whips up new creations while making sure that even the comfort and bar food items on the menu are both innovative and delicious, right down to the delicately fried chicken or the off-the-menu crab cake grilled cheese. Food wise, you simply cannot go wrong at Joe's, though some favorites include the shrimp and scallop ceviche, fried calamari with cocktail and tartar sauces, steakhouse salad with USDA choice fillet and crumbled bleu cheese, the twin tenderloin chopped steaks with grilled onions and peppers, the prime bone-in rib-eye, and a short rib special that is so tender that most waiters don't even bring out a knife for it. For sides, don't miss the downright decadent hash browns, or, if you have a guilty conscience, the somewhat-almost-healthy grilled tomatoes. <br><br>As for service, the Joe's staff always treats every customer like royalty despite dinner crowds that can feel like they rival Soldier Field during a Bears' game. This one of the last few establishments that wholeheartedly lives under the seemingly forgotten mantra of \"The Customer is Always Right\" and will always overcompensate for even the smallest of rare slip ups. The staff is quite knowledgeable about the entire menu, and keeps well abreast of the many specials and wine.

Originally a chain from Miami, the restaurant has sort of absorbed the Chicago restaurant attitude.

However, in terms of food, the restaurant is anything but ordinary.<br><br>I was lucky to get a pretty good sampling of the menu, as I started with the \"second mortgage\" seafood sampler appetizer and had the bone-in filet as a main course. The waiter was extremely good: he knew the menu very well, he was quick to answer any questions we had and while he did manage to upsell us into that seafood platter, it turned out to be exactly what we all wanted. He took pains to check on us often, refilled our drinks, and explained the ins and outs of everything we ordered as it arrived. Onwards to the food: the seafood appetizer was a great selection of the restaurant's signature shellfish dishes. The shrimp and scallop ceviche was nice and flavorful, with a citrus-y kick. The shrimp cocktail was nice, although the shrimp were certainly good enough to stand on their own. The stone crab claw was delicious, there was plenty of crab meat in the claw and it was precracked. Finally, the lobster cocktail (yes, lobster cocktail) was really nice. An interesting touch here is that they plopped a dollop of horseradish into the cocktail sauce, which gave it an interesting spiciness. Soon after they cleared these plates and dropped off some steak knives, they brought out the filet. I'm rather glad I ordered in the bone in cut, because the bone adds so much flavor. It was really juicy, perfectly medium-rare and seasoned very nicely. They also brought out a little dish of the seasoning they used for those that didn't think it was seasoned enough. The sides were also pretty great. The spinach with garlic was really flavorful, the stirfried sugar snap peas were delicious and the asparagus was pretty good too. I think we shouldn't have ordered the cottage potatoes, as they were kinda bland. Next time, I'm gunning for the hash browns or potatoes Lyonnais.<br><br>The atmosphere of the place is interesting. It kind of has an air of old Chicago about it, with the big leather booths, private dining area and slightly dim lighting. The mood lighting is maybe a little heavy, but it's not really intrusive. However, the din of the restaurant certainly is. When we started our meal, it was hard to be heard across the table without yelling. It got easier when the dinner rush started winding down, but in the end it wasn't really a problem, just more of an annoyance. It also definitely helps to go with a great group of people (much love to my cousins and fellow yelpers Melissa F and Sara F). Just try to make sure your party arrives all at once, because they won't seat you unless everyone's there and the bar is always really crowded.<br><br>So in summary:<br>1. The food's really solid in general.<br>2. Stone crab is delicious, as are the shrimp.<br>3. The steaks here are really nice, and the bone-in filet is great if you can tolerate a little bit of hacking to get at all of the steak.<br>4. The veggies are really good.<br>5. The waiters are good at their jobs.<br>6. Show up at the same time.<br>7. Going with family is lots of fun.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I stayed away from this place a good long while due to thinking it was an offshoot of Joe's Crab Shack.  Then we went here for some work thing.  Overall, s'ok but I would never make it a destination.  It's clearly geared toward being a lunch meeting type place, but in spite of the upscale vibe I found the seafood to be average.  Service was good, fast and curt like you'd expect.  They do seem to try to turn over tables quickly.  I'd go back, but it's not somewhere I would get that excited about.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The food and service were outstanding once again.

I liked Joe's, but couldn't help feel that no matter how nice the inside was, I was still just blocks off of Michigan Ave and tucked in the ground floor of a hirise. I don't have a problem paying for rent when I'm in a high traffic area, but I just felt like I was at any other tourist/suburbanite safe resturant. Joe's would be 5 stars if it was the little cozy place tucked back off of Taylor Street, that the decore wants to make it feel like. James, my server rocked and Scott & Stats at the bar were top notch. The people who work here know the menue up & down. The food was truely great. I really loved it, but it's just to commercialized. Well it is a Lettuce-entertain-you joint. I would giv eit 3 1/2 if they had 1/2 stars.", "pics": null}}]}
