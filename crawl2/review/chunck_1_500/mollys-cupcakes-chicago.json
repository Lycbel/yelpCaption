They even sell ice cream! <br><br>I included a photo of the make-your-own cupcake menu, because that intrigued me the most. There are also quite a few pre-fixed cupcake creations here at Molly's that I strongly considered, but I'm a sucker for banana flavors, so I went with a banana bread cake, buttercream frosting, and mini Oreo toppings. Molly's also offers the option of getting a frosting filling in your cupcake as well. <br><br>I can't believe I'd been missing out for so long on such a great place that is so close to my home.

The s'mores had a nice chocolate filling in the center with a light marshmallow frosting. The frosting was not too sweet and had a great whipped texture. The butterscotch cupcakes center was an tasty caramel pudding filling. Because the pudding filling is heavy, my cupcake began to split when I took it out of the box.

We began our wedding planning in September 2016 and the whole process with Molly's has been seamless. We booked a cake tasting in mid-September 2016 and we were immediately given a time slot the following week. Our cake tasting consisted of five classic Molly's cupcake flavors (vanilla, chocolate, red velvet, banana, and carrot) with all of their frosting options (vanilla, chocolate, cream cheese, brown butter, and buttercream). In addition, we were allowed to select two center-filled flavors to try. Needless to say, the creme-brulee flavor was a must-have but we also tried the blueberry cheesecake center-filled cupcake. I do not suggest having dinner prior to tasting because the portions were delightfully comparable to a meal. <br><br>During the tasting, our event coordinator was very careful to jot down notes and made meaningful inquiries to gauge our thoughts and plans. The whole process was about 30 minutes long. At the conclusion of the cake tasting, our event coordinator immediately emailed us the notes she had taken and followed up with the instructions should we decide to proceed with their service. I am big fan of their efficiency, especially since her notes were so thorough that I did not have to repeat myself. Therefore, within a week, we had confirmed the approximate number of guests, amount of cake we intend to book, deposit to secure the date, tentative delivery time, and design. <br><br>Fast forward ahead, in July 2017, Molly's sent us a check-in e-mail to inquire if we had any changes on our end, i.e. number of guests, wedding venue address and contact information, delivery times, etc. The fact that I did not have to take the initiative to follow up was a huge plus, considering how we had a ton of last-minute wedding plans to settle. It was a quick item to check off and without any further changes, we paid the remaining balance a month before our wedding.   <br><br>On our wedding day, Molly's deliverer was punctual to deliver both the wedding and sheet cakes well before our reception time. We did not have to fret about any last minute mishaps as the cakes arrived just as we had anticipated. When cake was served, our guests marveled about the selection, asked for seconds, and inquired of its origins. We briefly considered being selfish and withholding the information so we could have all the delicious cakes to ourselves, but of course, the best things in life (not calories) are meant to be shared. Let everyone have Molly's cupcakes!<br><br>P.S.

It was very reasonably priced!<br><br>THE NEGATIVES:<br><br>1. The emailing communication wasn't the best. Every time I reached out I got an auto message a few hours later saying they would get back to me ASAP which got annoying after a while since I would get excited thinking I got a response. I wish they had given us a specific baker's email so that we could avoid the headache. <br><br>2. All the meetings and tastings are at the Lincoln Park location and the parking is a NIGHTMARE. We ended up missing the first tasting appointment because we were driving around looking for a parking spot for OVER AN HOUR. Moral of the story: skip the car, take the train. <br><br>3. If you decide you want to taste test a seasonal flavor and it's not currently that season, you have to order an entire batch of cupcakes. We wanted to try tiramisu and pumpkin spice since we were getting married in October but they said we had to order and pay for a batch of them to taste them since we were there to try them in August and it wasn't Fall yet. Ultimately, we ended up biting the bullet and ordering the tiramisu ones which were pretty expensive. <br><br>4. They cannot do fondant. This is obviously a biased negative but for someone who was really hoping for a quilted fondant cake this was pretty disappointing. At the time, they were only offering a brown sugar frosting, regular frosting, or buttercream. We went with buttercream and it looked very crisp and clean. We also had them do draped sugar pearls and frosted flowers. It turned out pretty but not exactly what we had in mind. If you decide to go with a design, I recommend keeping it simple since they don't have as much experience with decorating. <br><br>OVERALL:<br><br>Definitely worth checking out if you're in the market for a simple cake that packs a lot of flavor. We are glad we used Molly's for our wedding cake and we love that we can stop in anytime for a cupcake in our wedding cake flavor!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I'm (not) sorry, but as I stated a decade ago these cupcakes are vastly overrated! It had been that long since I last had them and decided to give them another try after several people asked me about them. Keeping in mind that I have tried all the major cupcake places in Chicago, Molly's does not rank in my top 5. If you are the type that likes a filled cupcake, ie stuffed with some flavor in the cake, then you'll appreciate these. A true cupcake enthusiast will recognize that the cake should be able to stand on its own without being stuffed. And while Molly's does offer both, it's clear they pride themselves in the stuffed versions. As for flavors in still not convinced that their red velvet is a true red velvet. I could not detect the presence of chocolate in it. It seemed like it was a yellow cake that had been died red. If there is any chocolate in it then it is very little because the color is most definitely off (not a deep red, rather a marginal red). Overall these tasted at a level slightly above store bought cupcakes. There really wasn't anything particular about them that told me why they've been voted as one of the best cupcakes in the country. I can argue against that. One of the things I recall from my first tasting of them remains true these years later, they're a bit oily. I was still getting some on my fingers. As for cake flavors they are very limited: chocolate, vanilla and red velvet. There were a few other flavors for the specialty (stuffed) cupcakes, but again, it's all about the basics and there wasn't anything beyond the aforementioned.The frosting flavors are more varied. All in all I have about five other cupcake locations I'd go to before going to Molly's. They have better selections, better quality, use better ingredients and have more flavor in their cakes.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "We ended 4/19 'What the What' Wednesday with a trip to Molly's Cupcakes.

The flavor combinations were scrumptious, and although I do not like butterscotch, I can't imagine this cupcake without it!!<br><br>The Boston Cream is a vanilla cupcake with cream filling, dark chocolate frosting, and white chocolate shavings.

That creme is just amazing.  It's consistency and creaminess works well with the light cupcake, but you can't have a creme brûlée cupcake without the brûléed sugar on top.  Molly's does this, and the burnt sugar on top gives this cupcake another level of decadence and provides that small crunch that puts it over the top.  Molly's Cupcakes however knows that too much sweet and sugar isn't always the best.  To even out the sweet, they put fresh blueberries and raspberries on top to provide a tart flavor that cuts the sweetness and balances everything out.  Bottom line it's amazing, and you should try it.<br><br>Side Note:  This place is awesome to just hang out at as well.  If you are lucky enough to score a table, grab a board game and buy some milk to accompany your cupcake (yes, they serve milk... amazing right?), and just hangout.  Also the next best cupcake is the blueberry cheesecake, so try that too.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FYXk3WRtkd006jBjKegSSw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Creme brulee"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/B9qW3lYM2Kj4jp2k-QRQ-Q/168s.jpg", "caption": "Creme brulee cupcake ^_^"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "I hesitate to use hyperbole in reviews but when I say these cupcakes are life changing I really mean it.

Not gonna lie - we had an inquiry out to another Chicago cupcake place that I love and we moved forward with Molly's right away because they were able to get us immediate pricing information. I didn't have to talk to someone on the phone.  My fiance and I also loved that they didn't jack up their prices just because this was for a wedding. Because that's how all things wedding work. Nope. This was a price per cupcake and per cake for any type of event. The pricing also ended up being around what an actual wedding cake would cost and we all know real wedding cakes don't even taste that good. I wanted a dessert that tasted good!<br><br>We came in for our tasting and waddled out (these are very filling cupcakes). We picked 20 of five different varieties. We had 100 cupcakes for 120 guests which worked out (our venue provided an ice cream dessert as well). We had peanut butter nutella, cookie monster, cookies and cream, flourless chocolate cake, and birthday cake. We pretty much only had leftovers of birthday cake. I was very surprised about that so I wanted to mention that here. Obviously it's delicious. It's definitely not my favorite but I thought it'd be more appealing to our guests and I guess I was wrong.<br><br>We also had a small (their smallest?) cookie monster cake made for us to cut. We kept it plain and simple and it was also delicious. I can't really speak to the delivery process except that we paid for delivery and I didn't hear anything about it and our cupcakes were at our reception so as far as I'm concerned, that went off without a hitch as well.

Feeling like they want me out of here in an already uninviting atmosphere. I take a couple more moments to finish up a call and I hear a big clang, come to find out, some other worker comes and knocked my bag (full of work electronics) to the floor of off the stool next to me, and hastily picks it up and just says \"sorry\", and immediately turns back around as if nothing ever happened. It was very rude and the culmination of a bad experience. <br><br>I did not see them asking the other 2-3 people in the shop to basically buy or leave so I felt a bit targeted for not good reason. I had asked 2 employees about drinks and planned to still purchase despite not having exactly what I wanted on the menu.<br><br>I tend to work from coffee shops and have no problem buying and ordering, but I would like to pay an establishment that is inviting and I do it at my own pace. I may order a cup of coffee mid way through the hour, sometimes at the back.  Aside from the one worker, your staff (This particular morning) sucks. Get some manors and learn customer service.<br><br>EDIT/UPDATE<br>One of the employees of your shop approached me a week later at the grocery store to explain that \"I did not hear her apologizing at first\". She also said \"I should look at this from the view of the business employee/owner\", \"the counter was in fact for paying customers but you're are welcomed to say\" (which was NOT what was said to me) and that \"My review was very unfair\" and that \"she \"feels sorry for me\". Again, this was at a grocery store over a week later....I stand by my review. I would advise you engage in customer service or actually listen to me instead of randomly approaching me in an combative and defensive manor.

Moist, light, peachy with a hint of cinnamon. The filling is a bit heavy and caused the cupcake to fall apart after one bite, but it's delicious so no complaints. <br><br>4) The Ron Bennington - Ah-mazing!

Lastly, they have games, even Connect Four, for you to play while you stuff your face with one or two cupcakes.<br><br>I recommend:<br>- Cake Batter<br>- Blueberry Cheesecake<br>- Peach Cobbler<br>- Cookee Monster (that's how they spell cookee not me)", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "My favorite cupcakes in the entire world Molly cupcake's are so good u can't just have one the cookies are great I love Molly's cupcakes  so much any time I am in the Area I always have to stop in so delicious", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "First one to arrive at the party, and the last one to leave.  Most of the time, I'm on time.  The rest of the time, I'm early.  I was super thankful for this when I had time to stop at Molly's Cupcakes before meeting my friends for dinner.<br><br>The inside of Molly's is cute, but not overly bright or decorated.  There are a few tables to sit and stuff your face.<br><br>My friend Aimee M. met me here and bought me a cupcake for my birthday - yay!  Thanks Aimee!  I had the Creme Brulee cupcake, which is ten times more incredible than it sounds.  It's a cupcake with the crunchy glaze of a creme brulee, complete with a creamy middle and topped with berries.  THIS cupcake is 5 stars!<br><br>I purchased two cupcakes to take home and share.  I wasn't really impressed with either one:  the Raspberry Vanilla was just okay.  The cake was good, and the raspberry flavor of the frosting was good, but the frosting was a little bit...waxy?<br><br>The Ron Bennington, smothered with chocolate ganache and stuffed with a peanut butter center, is raved about by others, but I thought the glob of peanut butter was a bit too much.  PB & Chocolate isn't my favorite flavor combo, but it will most likely please those who can't get enough.  It's best served with a glass of milk!<br><br>That Creme Brulee cupcake was fantastic, but I could take or leave the other ones I tried.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "So I have to be honest with you here, I would have never known about Molly's if it wasn't for Ron & Fez, of the Opie & Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.

However even as an occasional listener of Ron & Fez, I still know then Ron Bennington of Ron & Fez has his own cupcake at Molly's Cupcakes in both Chicago & New York.

My coworkers and I made our way to Mollys and there was a line outside the bakery. I was not going to stand in line in the summer for a cupcake, no matter how good it was. We went to another cafe instead. The spark had been ignited and my curiosity would not get the best of me. I strategically planned my next attempt. I called and found out that the bakery is open late, so when I got off of work at 8pm, I headed over to them. Luckily it was a rainy friday night and there were a few people in the bakery. <br><br>As I made my way to the cupcakes, my mouth nearly dropped. They had so many that I had to order one of each basic flavor. Then I saw the specials (which change all the time) and I had to have the peanutbutter frosting, red velvet and the oreo. By the time, I got to the register the woman asked how I wanted my regular cupcakes frosted. I mustve looked puzzled because she explained that the specials were as is, but the regular cupcakes, I could choose the frosting, so I told her, give me different kinds, as i explained that it was my first time here. She rang my order up, $32.00/dzn wow!!!! I paid, and then looked up at the prices lol. Go figure, this would be my splurge. <br><br>I got home and i cut them all in quarter pieces n each day would try one slice of each cupcake. Yes, i did share with family. I was more fond of the buttercreme frosting. The red velvet, yellow cupcake with white or chocolate buttercreme frosting is so good. Its def not a place to go all the time, its perfect for a splurge or celebration.<br><br>Years later, I am still fond of this place. So much that, now that I work at Rush, I always talk about this place. For staff parties, I bring Mollys and so when I returned to work, the surgeon celebrated my returning by bringing me back in style with MOLLYs cupcakes. Thanks Dr. Rashad!!!!<br><br>Johnny (the founder of Mollys), thank you for being such a kind person and donating your cupcakes for our causes at the hospital. We are truly thankful for your big heart. Just so everyone knows, not one edible cupcake is ever thrown away. <br><br>I love that swing by the register, and you can sit and have a cup of coffee at the counter or at the tables but I will tell you that it tends to be noisy and there arent many tables.

If you are able to eat your selection in house, try to do so because the shop is so well laid out that eating here is elevated to an event.

It is to the point where if you don't like Molly's, I'm not sure if we can be friends...<br><br>All joking aside, I absolutely swear by Molly's Cupcakes. I love cupcakes, and everywhere I travel, I seek out the little confections. These are not only the best ones I've had in Chicago, but anywhere I've been! I used to live in Hyde Park, and before I had a car, I almost shed a tear when I realized I lived one mile outside of their 10  mile delivery radius. Do I camp out in a closet a mile north a la Elaine Benes from Seinfeld? Since that didn't work out too well for her, I would make the long bus and train journey to Lincoln Park just for these fabulous little cupcakes. Now that I have a car, I circle and circle around the neighborhood looking parking just to go this bakery. Whenever my friends are visiting from out of town, I bring them here. If a friend of mine is having a bad day, I know one sure way to cheer him/her up!<br><br>This cafe is decorated whimsically. Even though it's small, its filled with bright and cheery colors and have cute swing-seats by the bar. The employees are always bubbly, chatty, and friendly, even when the store is swamped with costumers. They serve Intelligentsia coffee here, so its a nice place to hang out for a quick afternoon sip and snack.<br><br>And then there are those cupcakes. I think I have tried each and every one at this point, and my favorite changes periodically. In general, I prefer the cupcakes with filled centers. My current favorite is the butterscotch carmel, which is very buttery, fluffy, and not too sweet. Another favorite for when you've got a craving for not one, but two nut spreads is the peanut butter nutella. It has a peanut butter cake and frosting and is filled with rich nutella. A unique pick is the blueberry cheesecake (a cupcake filled with cheesecake?! The charming, sweet cousin of the turducken!) or the cake batter if you are a lover of more simple flavors. To be honest, you can't go wrong with any flavor, they are all wonderful!<br><br>And with this review, I have professed my undying love! Molly's is a spot not to be missed!

Your cupcakes, however, have done just that.  And while my fidelity to Sprinkles remains steadfast, you've given me another reason to journey into Lincoln Park.<br><br>Molly's interior is straight-up charming, no question about it.

It's bright red, unlike the RV cupcakes at Sprinkles, which have a darker hue. The cake was soft but just a little dense. I'm not complaining though because you get a fairly large cupcake, all for less than three bucks. I went with the cream cheese frosting, and let's just say you can't fault Molly's for false advertising. While I like the more subtle cream cheese frosting on the Sprinkles cupcake better, Molly's frosting was still very good. It wasn't just an RV fest when we visited, though. My girlfriend got the key lime cupcake, which she absolutely loved! <br><br>One thing I like more about Molly's cupcakes than Sprinkles cupcakes are that they look more \"homemade,\" as my sister observed. The cupcakes at Sprinkles are too pristine, too perfectly constructed, like Uncle Jesse's beautifully styled hair. You almost don't want to eat them. Not the case at Molly's - the cupcakes are practically begging you to take a bite.<br><br>This place gets excellent marks for its friendly service, charming interior and exterior, excellent prices, and of course, delicious cupcakes.

First and most importantly, you need a good cupcake, Molly's were overly dry and either it's their style to get a crisp top or mine were burnt. It was more than just one cupcake though, so it's not like just one batch was in a little too long. The filling for some were overly sweet, the frostings for others were extremely heavy and overall they just didn't work. I can think of 4 cupcakes places in Chicago (Smallcakes, Sweet Mandy B's, Magnolia's, Sprinkles) that I'd rather get cupcakes from. I wouldn't go back and I wouldn't even eat one if offered. That's right, if someone GAVE me a cupcake from Molly's, I'd refuse. Eeessh.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I'm not a cupcake fan, but I have to say, this was really good!

I consider myself pretty current and thought the cupcake trend was dying down. I've also seen my fair share of overpriced, over-hyped, and trendy confections so I didn't care to eat just another cupcake.<br><br>We arrived at Molly's where the line was kind of a jumble, but I felt like it made me anticipate when it was finally my turn to see what was behind the display case. <br><br>We got 4 cupcakes: creme brulee, s'mores, and two molten chocolates. Pricing for filled cupcakes were like $3.75 and then regular cupcake prices vary by size. <br>$20 for 4 cupcakes? Seems a little steep, but I couldn't wait on the drive home and ate my brother's the molten chocolate. <br><br>I noticed on the sign that it had a flourless base, but you couldn't really tell. When it sunk in that each cupcake had a different filling, that's where I lost it. I bit into the molten chocolate ganache and was completely consumed by the chocolate flavor. It wasn't too sweet and it was just the right amount of chocolate. They top this cupcake with a whipped cream frosting that's supposed to curb the chocolate, but I ended up eating the cupcake upside down and foregoing the whipped topping all together. <br><br>The next day (I don't have any control), I had the creme brulee cupcake. Creme brulee is my favorite dessert so I'd say I know my way around creme brulee. This cupcake was everything you'd think of when you think of creme brulee. It has a carmelized sugar top that stays crispy. The cupcake itself stayed firm and not soggy. And the best part was the custard middle. <br><br>While my sister was at work, I ate her s'mores cupcake. (I know. Three cupcakes within 24 hours of each other. I have no shame.) By this time, I didn't think Molly's could make a good cupcake thrice over. I don't even like marshmallows, but this cupcake was also very delicious. <br><br>So there you have it. I couldn't stop after one, two, but three cupcakes. I would've eaten that fourth molten chocolate if someone else hadn't already gotten to it.

If you offer delivery, that seems like a pretty easy thing to change. I'm pretty sure Dominos can do that.

She is knowledgeable, thorough and very attentive to details. <br>-We communicated via e-mail which made setting up the tasting and finalizing details an easy and efficient process.<br>-At the tasting, Nicole helps you choose the cupcake combinations (cake flavor, filling, frosting, cupcake size, frosting color, conditions (refrigeration available or not))  that delight your palette and your budget. <br>-We chose to have our cupcakes delivered from Chicago to Plainfield to reduce stress on our wedding day. Even with that additional charge, it was an excellent value. <br>-Nicole promptly replied to e-mails and answered all of our questions. <br><br>Which cupcakes did we choose, you ask? After a intense cupcake tasting and much discussion with with our mouths filled with cupcakes, we chose three different kinds of regular sized cupcakes for our guests. None of them required refrigeration! <br><br>Here's what our wedding guests devoured:<br>1) Vanilla cupcake with brown butter frosting (colored orange)<br>2) Chocolate cupcake with buttercream frosting (colored yellow)<br>3) Red Velvet cupcake with chocolate frosting<br><br>We chose three \"Mega-cupcakes\" for ourselves. Two of the Megas sat at the top of our cupcake tower. The third Mega cupcake was frozen to celebrate our one year wedding anniversary. For our Megas, we chose the Ron Bennington (peanut butter filling) and the Mixed Berry (fresh berry puree filing). <br><br>Molly's also creates cakes, but we opted not to do a traditional cake. <br><br>I highly recommend choosing Molly's Cupcakes for your wedding cupcake needs! I've included photos to show our frosted gems!

Okay, confession: sometimes we go out of our way to walk by Molly's for a sweet treat.

It's our go-to dessert spot. <br><br>So, when the time came to start thinking about dessert at our wedding, we tossed around a few other ideas, but kept coming back to Molly's. We called them and they set up a tasting, which was SO fun. Basically, they bring out a gigantic tray of cupcakes and you get to try them all- which was amazing and kind of dessert overload, but in a good way! Though we tried lots of flavors, we decided to go with our tried and true favorites. Molly's was nice enough to turn his fave into a sheet cake, which would be served at the end of dinner alongside my red velvets as mini-cupcakes. <br><br>However, our experience w/Molly's didn't end there. As we were wrapping up planning our wedding, we were trying to figure out a fun favor to send home with our guests. We figured, why not give a late night snack. For this, Molly's created mini cookies for us in a variety of flavors that they individually shrink wrapped. They also did all of the legwork for us, placing these shrink wrapped treasures in cute bags sealed with stickers we provided for them. And they let us come in for a second tasting, just to try cookies, too. <br><br>Dessert was a HUGE hit with our guests- some even came up to us asking if there was more cake or cookies in back they could steal.

The filling is similar to the strawberry shortcake in the sense where it's jam like, but it works in this case. Easily, my favorite.<br>- Cake Batter: Filled with cake batter. What more is there to say? The fat kid that used to polish off the bowl of left over batter when mom made cakes is delighted.

Me being the caramel connoisseur I am opted for two of the caramel butterscotch. How a bakery with all of these 5 star reviews from hype(and sugar) induced yelpers can screw caramel up so bad in a feat within itself. For one, their butter cream is horrible. It was salted vanilla flavored, yet had an artificial, bitter aftertaste. The texture was more like whipped cream than frosting, so much so that I just checked the website to make sure it WASN'T. <br><br>The butterscotch filling was also just as bad. Had a horrible, unexplainably bitter taste and the texture was too smooth which caused it to be messy. These problems made eating the cupcake a very unpleasant experience.

They couldn't mess this up right?<br><br>Wrong. The texture was spongy, dense and contrived. These things can probably be used as stress balls. I'm sure their red velvet is nothing more than typical batter with excessive red food coloring. I got cream cheese frosting to top it and together with the cake formed a really bad combination. This wasn't the fault of the frosting, but the flavorless cupcake itself needed something stronger to make up for its shortcoming.<br><br>On top of that parking in this area is a BITCH; took over 15 minutes searching for a spot to use for 3 minutes. The filled cupcakes are $4. The regulars are $2. So that begs the question; how the hell is filling a cupcake with cheap artificially flavored sauce worth an extra $2 by itself?

I asked for some kind of reimbursement for those cupcakes  due to the fact that I was an hour away from the shop, and I could not go back to get new ones. The lady then told me that she can not give me any sort of reimbursement due to the fact that I did not pay for the cookie and that the only reason they put the cookie on the cupcake is to be nice (Not true; The cupcakes are always decorated with a cookie on top). I then explained to the lady that only 1 out of the 4 cupcakes had that decorative element to it. I explained to her that it looks dumb and unprofessional. She then told me that I could just take the cookie off of the other cupcake. That's when I got really upset. The lady clearly thought it was funny that I was complaining about such matter, but what she did not understand is that I paid that much money for neat, decorative cupcakes. I then told her that she was no help and hung up the phone. The lady made NO effort at all to reach me, even after realizing how upset I was.<br><br>As small as this situation may look, this business CLEARLY does not care for their customers and is CLEARLY only concerned with the profit component of the business.

It was bad. It was severe. And when asked what kind of cupcake I specifically wanted I, without hesitation answered, \"Molly's Cupcakes--chocolate cupcake with peanut butter filling, chocolate frosting, and Butterfinger crumbles.\" Oh good Lord did I want, nay--NEED that cupcake. But alas it was late, and Molly's, although only a short walk away, was closed. So my cupcake craving was denied. <br><br>In the last few years a lot of cupcake places have popped up in Chicago and many have been really good (Sweet Mandy B's) and many have been bad (Cupcakes! on Briar/Broadway--great flavors but too dry and poorly executed). But for me, Molly's takes the cake (ZING! I've GOT to be the first person to make that joke, right?). The cake itself is nice and moist, the frosting is rich but not too heavy. Being something of a sweets aficionado I have come to know that my favorite type of butter cream frosting is easy on the butter and heavy on the creamy. Molly's is just that. Creamy but not heavy. Not like eating a stick of butter which in theory sounds awesome but in practice is kind of gross.<br><br>The space itself is adorable. I chatted with an employee shortly after they opened and she told me that the owner started the business in homage to an elementary school teacher who would bake amazing cupcakes for all the kids on each of their birthdays (I believe Molly's may even use that exact recipe). CUTE! So to bring back that feeling of childhood Molly's is decorated as a kid friendly space--board games, colorful decor, wooden swings at the bar, a cupcake decorating station. The employee told me that the wood itself (for the swings and other pieces of decor) is actually pulled from the floors of a local elementary school. I don't know if that's true or not but I like to think it is which is why I'm repeating the rumor here.<br><br>Furthering their commitment to kids and education, Molly's donates a portion of their proceeds to local schools. How awesome is that? Super awesome!<br><br>So if you're in the mood for a cupcake and you're in the Lincoln Park area be sure to hit Molly's. I know it's a bit pricier than some cupcake joints but it's just so delightful. The cupcake you get will be definitely worth the money and some of that money will go to help a local school.

Like the old Judy Garland song- I thought Molly's Cupcakes was going to be just another cupcake store. But boy- was I wrong! <br><br>First- the cupcakes. I'm a plain kind of girl so my first choice will always be a yellow cake cupcake with chocolate frosting (no sprinkles please). At Molly's-they didn't just reach into the case and grab me one- oh no. The girl waiting on me got a plain cupcake out of a container in the back and the piped on the rich decadent chocolate frosting with a pastry bag. Yum! <br><br>So as I sat at the table envying those who sat at the \"bar\" on the adult sized swing seats (not to worry- they are bolted to the floor so the fun doesn't get too far out of hand!) I schemed how I could come back and pick up some cupcakes to take home. <br><br>The great news? Molly's is open until midnight. A midnight bakery? Now this is quite the find! So as I went up the street to indulge in a little beer garden action at one of the many bars along this stretch of Clark- I made a mental note that I would be back. And I was. <br><br>With 10 minutes to spare -good thing I didn't have more time as I really have no idea who is going to eat all of the cupcakes that I bought- but they were so cute and the flavors beckoned to me; red velvet cake, coconut cream,chocolate decadence and plain. What could be more comforting than a little box of cupcakes? <br><br>So I'll end as I began . . .

Well, it was good but not good enough to make me not regret going with a different one .

I'm going in.  <br><br>First of all the place is super cute.  All their cupcakes have cute little drawings on them (Speaks to the child in me)  The choices were:<br><br>Cookie Monster:  Mmm... raw cookie dough inside a cupcake.  The frosting was super light.  Definitely not overpowering nor too much.  Batter super light not dense or heavy at all.  And what girl can resist cookie dough.. come on?! <br><br>Rob Bennington: Supposedly a customer favorite.  My bf liked it, me not so much.  The peanut butter was too much for me.  Too sweet.  But i still ate it<br><br>Boston Creme:  I love BC donuts that i had to try this.  Whoa! cool... It captures the BC donut essense in a cupcake.  Again the batter was light.  The creme filling was just right.  The frosting not too sweet.. light enough.<br><br>Also ordered a latte.  Its Intelligentsia so yeah.. it was good.<br><br>Fast forward two days later..

Molly's was just that. Walking into the bakery is like stepping into your old kindergarten classroom.

It's hard not to fall in love with this place. <br><br>I'm usually not a cupcake fan. Ok, correction - I've always hated cupcakes. The frosting has always been too sugary, the cake has always seemed too dry, and they're just too damn hard to eat with your hands once you're more than halfway done with them. However, I must admit that after my first try at Molly's I was converted. Every single cupcake there is absolute perfection! <br><br>First of all, they've got their buttercream down to a science. It's not too sweet, not too thick, and it'll leave you wanting more. The actual cake has a wonderful, moist consistency and it's light enough to not make you want to run to the gym right after your first bite. And maybe it's just me, but who's ever thought about eating a cupcake with a fork? My rule of thumb is if it's small enough to fit in your hands, then why not eat it with them? Cupcakes have always been a problem for me in this case, but Molly's has got you covered! They serve your cupcake on a plate, then you grab your fork, knife, and whatever else you need to demolish this scrumptious creation by the sprinkle station. That's right, they have a section of the bakery where you can shower your cupcake with more yummy goodness!   <br><br>I've had a number of their cupcakes, and they're all really delicious,  but I'd have to say that the red velvet is my favorite so far. They also have other treats there like cookies, chocolate covered strawberries, pies, and brownies (which I'm sure are all just as spectacular as their cupcakes). To wash all their goods down, they also serve coffee, tea, and of course - milk! <br><br>Molly's is located in a busy area, so naturally, finding street parking is a complete nightmare. I'd say that despite trying to find a spot to squeeze your car into and the fact that the eating experience will last less than 5 minutes (because I just know that you will scarf that thing down), Molly's is still worth the visit.  It's cute, fun, kid-friendly, and your jaw will literally drop once you have a taste of Molly's cupcakes.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Not a surprise - the cupcakes at our wedding on 5/25/13 were AMAZING.

At the store, I felt too many \"varieties\" I saw in the case were just chocolate or vanilla cake with different frostings. I bought one apple cinnamon and one cookies-n-cream chocolate. At home, before sampling, I'd pretty much decided Molly's was a 3-star cupcake shop, maybe 4. But then we tasted them. WOW! The apple cinnamon was so unique for a cupcake, so moist and so well balanced between the apple and the cinnamon. Still very sweet, but not over the top, and you could still taste the cake.

I clarified, \"So if I come in around 5:00 this evening there will be a dozen red velvets for me to buy?\" Yes, is what she said. She wouldn't let me order them, she was so confident. (I should've listened to my gut) Well, you can see where this is going. I show up around 5:00 and the cases look empty.  I order my dozen and she tells me they only have 9. No more coming, as today was unexpectedly busy. I explain my phone call earlier in the day, but no dice. She asks what other flavors do I want, no offer to discount my order or allow me to upgrade to the more expensive type of cupcakes. So I order 3 more chocolate cupcakes and a coffee. She gives me the coffee for free, so that was something.<br>So, the taste. Wow, the red velvet was good, particularly the frosting. Possibly even just the frosting, but it was good enough I didn't care. Then the chocolate cake with chocolate frosting - meh, not so much. The cake was a bit dry and the frosting was too sweet, not enough chocolate taste, and all around reminds me of the grocery store cake version of chocolate frosting. It was the totally opposite of the cream cheese frosting, which was decadent and rich, huge flavors of cream cheese without being too sweet or overpowering.<br>I would most likely go back and try some of the filled cupcakes, but maybe avoid ones with chocolate.

She should have been serving the customers the cupcakes.)<br><br>So a couple days later I went back.  I went out of my way on a Monday evening to travel from the suburbs by public transit just to get my family some of these cupcakes everyone is raving about.  After my 3 + hour commute, I was really looking forward to some great customer service at Molly's.  I walked in the store, and I was the only one there in line!  I went right to the counter eager to ask all kinds of questions about the cupcakes, and I had the same girl who just simply said, \"Do you know what you want?\"  I was attempting to ask my questions, with the girl at the counter just looking annoyed, not answering me, then some customers came in behind me.  I didn't want to take up anyone's time, but at the same time my questions weren't being answered.  The girl behind the counter curtly said, \"we do make them how you want them.  if you don't know what you want step aside and let the other customers order.\"  Not wanting to hold up the line, I just quickly ordered the mix and match cupcakes (vanilla cake, chocolate frosting) and a few others.  She rushed me over to the register and I said calmly, \"Oh, please make sure you put alot of frosting on.\"  I'm not sure if she heard me, but the line was piling up behind me for people to pay, so I didn't worry about it.  I trusted the cupcakes would be worth it.  The girl hands me the box, and I had to ask for a bag, which was a problem seeing that she rolled her eyes when I asked for a bag.  I said, \"I'm sorry to bother you for a bag, but I have to take 2 buses and 2 trains with these cupcakes.\"  <br><br>So far, I felt like I was just a bother to the employees, and definitely not a welcome customer.  The people in there behind me were regulars, they didn't have any questions, which seems to make the process easier, understandably, but this is a service business, so there needs to be good customer service.<br><br>NOW, I got home after my long train ride, greeted my husband and son with the box of cupcakes we had all been looking forward to (I hadn't opened them at this point.)  When I opened them the order was entirely wrong.  I asked for specific pairings of cake and frosting, half of the cupcakes had literally a 1.5 inch diameter x 4mm height of frosting on them.  My son looked at them and said, \"that's it?\"  We're all too familiar with the massive amount of frosting Magnolia, Crumbs, and Sprinkles.  (The customer service we have received at the mentioned cupcake bakeries was great, by the way, despite how busy these places get.)<br><br>I emailed <a href=\"mailto:info@mollyscupcakes.com\">info@mollyscupcakes.com</a> and had a useless discussion with the GM.  I won't name anyone, but this general manager showed absolutely zero understanding that they messed up my cupcakes, and the attitudes were terrible.  She didn't even offer to replace them.  She spent all her time in the emails back and forth being defensive, saying, \"oh, I'll look into it, surely this can't be possible, we don't receive *any* complaints as you can see from our reviews.\"  I then responded, \"It is very possible as with many customers who've had bad experiences that many don't bother to take the time to write a letter about it or discuss the issue.  Instead people who've had bad experiences just end up telling their friends about it.\"   <br><br>So as of now, I'm awaiting a response from the GM of Molly's.  She could have really mended this situation, but she just steered me in the opposite direction, I couldn't run any faster from this place.  I will stick to the many other cupcake bakeries in the city and burbs that offer great cakes made correctly AND great customer service.<br><br>My husband and I will be sure to tell our friends to stay away.  My husband buys pastries and such for his employees bi-weekly, so we're always looking for new places to buy large quantities of pastries/cupcakes from.  My husband mentioned this to her by email, and she told him, \"that's your loss, Mr. M***.\"  My husband was just speechless when he read me the email over the phone.<br><br>UPDATED 3/20 at 10:55pm:  G***, the General Manager, has emailed me back a verbally abusive letter!  If anyone would like to see the email, please contact me through Yelp and I'll be happy to inform you of the terrible service here.  She made it clear she's not going to resolve the situation due to the \"Yelp\" review.

Okay, so don't tell my boyfriend, but a man who makes cupcakes for a living and who can come up with the brilliant idea of a \"Sprinkle Station\" ...? LOVE. At first bite, that is. <br><br>I recently visited Chicago for a whopping five days, and all five days I noshed some delicious Molly's Cupcakes. I give you, a sampling of these days of orgasmic cakey goodness.<br><br>1. The Triple Berry: Hopefully I'm getting the name right, but this cupcake was outstanding. It was a yellow-ish cake with a creamy berry center and purple berry icing and fresh berries on top. The cake was soft, spongy, and absolutely decadent, but not too rich to knock me completely off my feet. It was just enough to, well, get me hooked. If you like fresh berries, this cake's for you.<br><br>2. The classic Red Velvet: The test of a good bakery is how they can do up Red Velvet. Luckily, Molly's has this classic cake down. The red velvet was soft and moist, and the frosting was classic and creamy. Thumb's up!<br><br>3. The Vegan yellow cake with chocolate frosting: YUM. A vegan cake this good should be outlawed. Better yet, it should be sold as a regular cupcake so people don't know that they're eating something so healthfully delicious. It was uber moist and the frosting was soooo creamy and good. I don't know how they do it, but WOW.<br><br>4. The CINNAMON ROLL cupcake: Seriously? A cinnamon roll cupcake? Let me describe how I ate this ... I pealed off the paper, and took layer by layer off the cupcake (yes, it's like a cinnamon roll), swinging it through the creamy frosting on top so that EVERY bite was filled with the delicious frosting. This was better than any regular cinnamon roll I've ever had. CHEERS to you guys. I could eat this for breakfast EVERY day.<br><br>The place is adorned with childhood favorites -- board games, swings that you can sit on while enjoying your cupcakes, and even signs on the doors of the bathroom that ring of elementary classroom days. Overall, this place is HOPPING with fun and childhood goodness. Where else in Chicago can you feel THIS much like a kid while also enjoying gourmet, hip-style cupcakes that won't break the bank?<br><br>Nowhere. That's where. So go in, say hi to Mike, enjoy a delicious cupcake, and play Connect Four.

The vanilla with chocolate was, as per usual, my favorite. The frosting was perfect--rich, sweet, and smooth. I could literally eat spoonfuls of it. The cake was moist and eggy, just how I like it. The Ron Bennington was a close second--very rich and chocolatey, with the perfect amount of peanut butter flavor. The red velvet was also very moist and tasty, although there wasn't any cocoa flavor like I've come to expect from red velvet.

Of course for a dozen Molly's gives you $3.50 off where Sugar Bliss gave you $2.00 off.

I got four to bring home to share with the boy (two vanilla and two chocolate - one of each for each of us), and I splurged and had one from the build-your-own bar while I was there. The one I had at Molly's was vanilla cupcake with the brown-butter frosting I'd heard so much about. And it was good, but boy, was it sweet. They could probably halve the amount of sugar and it would still be sweet. The cake itself was still warm, so I was expecting something moist and gooey, and it wasn't - more like warm and kind of dry.<br><br>The sweet frosting and dry cake were a theme for the other cupcakes that we tried. Both of us thought the vanilla cupcakes were dry and bland, with very little actual vanilla flavoring (especially compared to the champion of vanilla cupcakes, Dinkel's), and the frosting was soooo sweet and even a little grainy from all of the sugar. The chocolate cupcakes were better than the vanilla - moister and with a richer flavor, and the sweet buttercream worked slightly better on the chocolate than on the vanilla. The boy had chocolate frosting on his chocolate cupcake and he was it was good, but still overly sweet for him. <br><br>Molly's is super cute, but I don't think we'll be back unless we're walking by when my sweet tooth hits me or I have a small child with me - because the sugariness and the decor are extremely kid-friendly.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I really have no idea what is with the 1-star (or even 3-star) reviews.<br><br>This place is pretty darn awesome.  My wife loves cupcakes, and love is an understatement, so I've sampled quite a few, and this place has damn good cupcakes.  In particular, the peanut butter chocolate is amazing.<br><br>Also, the space is great, the people are nice, and they have some sweet board games.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I think, before I review this, it's important to mention that I really don't have a sweet tooth.<br><br>With the exception of cupcakes...<br><br>Heavenly.  Walking into this darling (yes, I said darling) little bakery, I knew I was in love.  Serious cupcake love.  This spoken by a woman who has professed her undying devotion to Sweet Mandy B's...I loved it.<br><br>The varieties are creative and fun, the presentation is lovely, the swing chairs at the little bar?  Just too cute!  <br><br>We tried the strawberry shortcake cupcake (heavenly, as they hide a delicious little bit of strawberry on the inside) and the \"Ron Bennington\" cupcake...which is chocolate and peanut butter and out of this world!  Top that off with a hot cup of Intelligentsia and I'm in heaven.  But I think I already said that...just do NOT tell Sweet Mandy.  She'd never understand.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I've only had plain old chocolate so far and it's the best in the entire city hands down.

Everyone behind the counter greets you with a smile, the owner is usually churning out coffees and teas, and I am pleased with the cheeriness of the place. It helps that the decor has swing chairs at the bar, colorful tables, board games, and fun cutouts at the bathroom. If you don't get a seat at the counter, sitting at the quaint tables is just as fun.<br><br>Seeing the owner work just as hard as his staff scores major points for me.

Fabulous cupcake joint in Chicago. It's like eating a cupcake in a wonderful fun loving gay club.

I have been making (and eating) cupcakes since a very young age, being sure to lick the bowl afterwards, salmonella be damned! Usually, I don't even like to eat other people's cupcakes, just because I enjoy the process of making them.<br><br>Until Molly's.<br><br>I was never one of those girls who begged her boyfriend to take her out for cupcakes, since I knew I could whip some up at home. But then I had Molly's Red Velvet cupcake with cream cheese frosting and ADORABLE red heart sprinkles, and I just died. I have never had a red velvet cupcake as moist or as flavorful as Molly's. <br><br>I struggle everytime I go, thinking \"Will this be the day that I don't get a red velvet cupcake?\" And everytime, I fail. However, I have started getting two cupcakes (and eating them all in one sitting, oops) and I have to say that they are all very good. While some people have complained of the price of the center-filled cupcakes, I have split them with people (I know, blasphemous) and been perfectly content with my half, and it's a great way to try them. <br><br>Getting the mini assorted ones is a great thing to bring to a party to add some delicious dessert.<br><br>The sprinkles counter is the best; my boyfriend got super excited to put dinosaur sprinkles on his cupcake! The decor of Molly's is adorable as well, with the swing sets for chairs at the \"bar\" area. And the board games!

The Vanilla cupcakes have a great balance between sugar and salt. Many of their filled cupcakes are good, but I like the simple Molly cupcakes. <br><br>However, I do think that the staff and owners don't fully recognize the very important  issue of customer appreciation. I have been into Molly's several times over the past few years, often buying 6-12 at a time. Not once have I had an interaction with the staff that would suggest they appreciate the business, or offer anything for me to try, or let me know about something really great that I should try. That really stands out. If I go somewhere a lot and they recognize that, and offer me a sample, or a free cup of coffee, or an extra cupcake with the 12 I just ordered, I would be forever loyal, and that type of loyalty is what really spreads word of mouth.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I finally dragged my lazy ass outside on a gorgeous 55 degree day in the city last Sunday.  After eating at Crisp, I noticed Molly's here for the first time and quickly swerved my car over to take a look inside.  What a fun and interesting place!!

They have every cupcake you can imagine, and even a \"make it yourself\" option where you pick the cake frosting and toppings... And my new favorite thing that I saw - they have a Sprinke Bar. Haha. I know it's kind of pointless but I just think it is so cute. <br><br>I just learned that they have Wifi as well, so that's even cooler. It's really such a nice lively alternative to a coffee shop to sit and relax... grab a cupcake and cup of coffee, do your work, play a board game, whatever!

Molly's is where I would bring my friends and family to go hang out because it's just a lot of fun there.

What an brilliant idea! It kinda reminds me of a day care or a kindergarten.<br><br>Feeling nostalgic already? I am not quite done yet. They have some of the best cupcakes in town. From specialty cupcakes to the clasics, there is something for everybody. Can't find what you are looking for? Custom create one! Yes, there is no shame in having a red velvet with chocolate frosting. Well, my personal favorite is their red velvet and the vanilla cupcake with brown butter frosting (custom). The brown butter frosting is a must-try! Wait, there's also a sprinkle station, in case it's not enough.<br><br>They are open till midnight on Fridays and Saturdays - just perfect to end the night.
