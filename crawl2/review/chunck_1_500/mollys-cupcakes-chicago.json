They even sell ice cream! <br><br>I included a photo of the make-your-own cupcake menu, because that intrigued me the most. There are also quite a few pre-fixed cupcake creations here at Molly's that I strongly considered, but I'm a sucker for banana flavors, so I went with a banana bread cake, buttercream frosting, and mini Oreo toppings. Molly's also offers the option of getting a frosting filling in your cupcake as well. <br><br>I can't believe I'd been missing out for so long on such a great place that is so close to my home.

The s'mores had a nice chocolate filling in the center with a light marshmallow frosting. The frosting was not too sweet and had a great whipped texture. The butterscotch cupcakes center was an tasty caramel pudding filling. Because the pudding filling is heavy, my cupcake began to split when I took it out of the box.

We began our wedding planning in September 2016 and the whole process with Molly's has been seamless. We booked a cake tasting in mid-September 2016 and we were immediately given a time slot the following week. Our cake tasting consisted of five classic Molly's cupcake flavors (vanilla, chocolate, red velvet, banana, and carrot) with all of their frosting options (vanilla, chocolate, cream cheese, brown butter, and buttercream). In addition, we were allowed to select two center-filled flavors to try. Needless to say, the creme-brulee flavor was a must-have but we also tried the blueberry cheesecake center-filled cupcake. I do not suggest having dinner prior to tasting because the portions were delightfully comparable to a meal. <br><br>During the tasting, our event coordinator was very careful to jot down notes and made meaningful inquiries to gauge our thoughts and plans. The whole process was about 30 minutes long. At the conclusion of the cake tasting, our event coordinator immediately emailed us the notes she had taken and followed up with the instructions should we decide to proceed with their service. I am big fan of their efficiency, especially since her notes were so thorough that I did not have to repeat myself. Therefore, within a week, we had confirmed the approximate number of guests, amount of cake we intend to book, deposit to secure the date, tentative delivery time, and design. <br><br>Fast forward ahead, in July 2017, Molly's sent us a check-in e-mail to inquire if we had any changes on our end, i.e. number of guests, wedding venue address and contact information, delivery times, etc. The fact that I did not have to take the initiative to follow up was a huge plus, considering how we had a ton of last-minute wedding plans to settle. It was a quick item to check off and without any further changes, we paid the remaining balance a month before our wedding. Â  <br><br>On our wedding day, Molly's deliverer was punctual to deliver both the wedding and sheet cakes well before our reception time. We did not have to fret about any last minute mishaps as the cakes arrived just as we had anticipated. When cake was served, our guests marveled about the selection, asked for seconds, and inquired of its origins. We briefly considered being selfish and withholding the information so we could have all the delicious cakes to ourselves, but of course, the best things in life (not calories) are meant to be shared.

The cake was delivered on time, by the head chef, and they agreed to use our personalized cake topper. They were also willing to use our cake plate which we just dropped off at the Lincoln Park location the month before our wedding. And, they included a side of chocolate ganache, cut strawberries, and mini chocolate chip cookies to be served with our cake at the reception.<br><br>4. The cake was ENORMOUS. They give you the width of the cake when you order it but we had no idea how tall it would be. We had a very small wedding with only 25 people in attendance so we ordered a 2 tier cake and it was WAY too much. Which was wonderful, we ended up with lots of left overs!!!<br><br>5. It was very reasonably priced!<br><br>THE NEGATIVES:<br><br>1. The emailing communication wasn't the best. Every time I reached out I got an auto message a few hours later saying they would get back to me ASAP which got annoying after a while since I would get excited thinking I got a response. I wish they had given us a specific baker's email so that we could avoid the headache. <br><br>2. All the meetings and tastings are at the Lincoln Park location and the parking is a NIGHTMARE. We ended up missing the first tasting appointment because we were driving around looking for a parking spot for OVER AN HOUR. Moral of the story: skip the car, take the train. <br><br>3. If you decide you want to taste test a seasonal flavor and it's not currently that season, you have to order an entire batch of cupcakes. We wanted to try tiramisu and pumpkin spice since we were getting married in October but they said we had to order and pay for a batch of them to taste them since we were there to try them in August and it wasn't Fall yet. Ultimately, we ended up biting the bullet and ordering the tiramisu ones which were pretty expensive. <br><br>4. They cannot do fondant. This is obviously a biased negative but for someone who was really hoping for a quilted fondant cake this was pretty disappointing. At the time, they were only offering a brown sugar frosting, regular frosting, or buttercream. We went with buttercream and it looked very crisp and clean. We also had them do draped sugar pearls and frosted flowers. It turned out pretty but not exactly what we had in mind. If you decide to go with a design, I recommend keeping it simple since they don't have as much experience with decorating. <br><br>OVERALL:<br><br>Definitely worth checking out if you're in the market for a simple cake that packs a lot of flavor. We are glad we used Molly's for our wedding cake and we love that we can stop in anytime for a cupcake in our wedding cake flavor!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I'm (not) sorry, but as I stated a decade ago these cupcakes are vastly overrated! It had been that long since I last had them and decided to give them another try after several people asked me about them. Keeping in mind that I have tried all the major cupcake places in Chicago, Molly's does not rank in my top 5. If you are the type that likes a filled cupcake, ie stuffed with some flavor in the cake, then you'll appreciate these. A true cupcake enthusiast will recognize that the cake should be able to stand on its own without being stuffed. And while Molly's does offer both, it's clear they pride themselves in the stuffed versions. As for flavors in still not convinced that their red velvet is a true red velvet. I could not detect the presence of chocolate in it. It seemed like it was a yellow cake that had been died red. If there is any chocolate in it then it is very little because the color is most definitely off (not a deep red, rather a marginal red). Overall these tasted at a level slightly above store bought cupcakes. There really wasn't anything particular about them that told me why they've been voted as one of the best cupcakes in the country. I can argue against that. One of the things I recall from my first tasting of them remains true these years later, they're a bit oily. I was still getting some on my fingers. As for cake flavors they are very limited: chocolate, vanilla and red velvet. There were a few other flavors for the specialty (stuffed) cupcakes, but again, it's all about the basics and there wasn't anything beyond the aforementioned.The frosting flavors are more varied. All in all I have about five other cupcake locations I'd go to before going to Molly's. They have better selections, better quality, use better ingredients and have more flavor in their cakes.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "We ended 4/19 'What the What' Wednesday with a trip to Molly's Cupcakes.

The flavor combinations were scrumptious, and although I do not like butterscotch, I can't imagine this cupcake without it!!<br><br>The Boston Cream is a vanilla cupcake with cream filling, dark chocolate frosting, and white chocolate shavings.

Â The icings, albeit there is a large amount of frosting, is sweet and decadent, but not too sweet that you feel like you have to run to the dentist right afterwards. Â I'm the type to remove frosting from my cake, but here's at Molly's I devour everything. Â <br><br>The must have cupcake here is the creme brÃ»lÃ©e cupcake. Â This just maybe the epitome of cupcakes. Â The cake is still airy and light, but it's filled with the creme... That creme is just amazing. Â It's consistency and creaminess works well with the light cupcake, but you can't have a creme brÃ»lÃ©e cupcake without the brÃ»lÃ©ed sugar on top. Â Molly's does this, and the burnt sugar on top gives this cupcake another level of decadence and provides that small crunch that puts it over the top. Â Molly's Cupcakes however knows that too much sweet and sugar isn't always the best. Â To even out the sweet, they put fresh blueberries and raspberries on top to provide a tart flavor that cuts the sweetness and balances everything out. Â Bottom line it's amazing, and you should try it.<br><br>Side Note: Â This place is awesome to just hang out at as well. Â If you are lucky enough to score a table, grab a board game and buy some milk to accompany your cupcake (yes, they serve milk... amazing right?), and just hangout. Â Also the next best cupcake is the blueberry cheesecake, so try that too.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FYXk3WRtkd006jBjKegSSw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Creme brulee"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/B9qW3lYM2Kj4jp2k-QRQ-Q/168s.jpg", "caption": "Creme brulee cupcake ^_^"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "I hesitate to use hyperbole in reviews but when I say these cupcakes are life changing I really mean it.

I'm leaving this review because we just used Molly's for our wedding in Oak Brook and I'm so happy with our decision. The whole process was seamless. What I especially loved was that they had an up front, to the point, pricing sheet. That makes things SO easy. Who wants to beat around the bush and not get exact pricing right away?!?! Not gonna lie - we had an inquiry out to another Chicago cupcake place that I love and we moved forward with Molly's right away because they were able to get us immediate pricing information. I didn't have to talk to someone on the phone. Â My fiance and I also loved that they didn't jack up their prices just because this was for a wedding. Because that's how all things wedding work. Nope. This was a price per cupcake and per cake for any type of event. The pricing also ended up being around what an actual wedding cake would cost and we all know real wedding cakes don't even taste that good. I wanted a dessert that tasted good!<br><br>We came in for our tasting and waddled out (these are very filling cupcakes). We picked 20 of five different varieties. We had 100 cupcakes for 120 guests which worked out (our venue provided an ice cream dessert as well). We had peanut butter nutella, cookie monster, cookies and cream, flourless chocolate cake, and birthday cake. We pretty much only had leftovers of birthday cake. I was very surprised about that so I wanted to mention that here. Obviously it's delicious. It's definitely not my favorite but I thought it'd be more appealing to our guests and I guess I was wrong.<br><br>We also had a small (their smallest?) cookie monster cake made for us to cut. We kept it plain and simple and it was also delicious. I can't really speak to the delivery process except that we paid for delivery and I didn't hear anything about it and our cupcakes were at our reception so as far as I'm concerned, that went off without a hitch as well.

Â Can we please bring Molly's Cupcakes to center stage, please? Â We need the real fluffy cupcakes to please stand up, please stand up! Â Now that I've got everybody's attention, let me say this: these are by far, the best cupcakes I have ever had! Â Similar to what others have asserted - I have been hard-pressed to find a cupcake that isn't dry or tasteless, or maybe even both. Â The daily, fresh-baked cupcakes at Molly's Cupcakes erases all the bad, evil memories of those bland cupcakes I've had in the past...also known as PTCD (post-traumatic cupcake disorder).<br><br>Although I've never been a cupcake fiend, these were some sweet treats that I definitely wouldn't mind having again! Â In fact, I'd gladly go back again to indulge in some of the other creative concoctions they've cooked up. Â Because Molly's Cupcakes does have so many wonderfully inviting cupcakes, it was extremely difficult to make a decision, but ultimately I got these fantastic four:<br><br>1. Creme BrÃ»lÃ©e<br>2. Chocco-cino Â (Coffee)<br>3. White Chocolate Raspberry<br>4. (Flourless) Chocolate Mousse <br><br>Knowing I'd have such difficulty determining which one was my favorite, my fiancÃ© maliciously asked, \"so which is your favorite?\". Â To be honest, I still couldn't tell you because each of them were ridiculously sweet and the flavor was dominating! Â The creme brÃ»lÃ©e cupcake truly tasted like it was a product of France, the chocco-cino was perfect for a coffee-lover, the white chcolate raspberry was my idea of perfection and the chocolate mousse was dense and well...chocolatey! Â <br><br>Each cupcake was just as amazing as the other; the batter was moist and the frosting both on top and inside the cupcake were the definition of creamy! Â The flavor was spot on! Â The only real complaint I had was that there was so much filling in the inside of the cupcake that as soon as I bit into it the entire thing fell apart. Â I wish there was a little less icing because of that, but it's understandable that this is what makes the cupcake so moist. Â Other than the cupcake itself, the cost of each was a little high...I try not to be too harsh because it is a boutique shop that makes their cupcakes daily. Â Just beware that for four cupcakes it about $16. Â I'd also gotten a sprinkled sugar cookie ($3-ish) so I walked outta dropping a good dollar to fulfill my sweet tooth. Â The cookie was good, but definitely stick to what they are known for - cupcakes! <br><br>With all that being said, it's a fun place to walk into and eat at because the staff keeps it lively and upbeat. Â The staff were dancing and singing while serving their customers - I enjoyed the vibe they were giving off. Â So fun!

Get some manors and learn customer service.<br><br>EDIT/UPDATE<br>One of the employees of your shop approached me a week later at the grocery store to explain that \"I did not hear her apologizing at first\". She also said \"I should look at this from the view of the business employee/owner\", \"the counter was in fact for paying customers but you're are welcomed to say\" (which was NOT what was said to me) and that \"My review was very unfair\" and that \"she \"feels sorry for me\". Again, this was at a grocery store over a week later....I stand by my review.

Moist, light, peachy with a hint of cinnamon. The filling is a bit heavy and caused the cupcake to fall apart after one bite, but it's delicious so no complaints. <br><br>4) The Ron Bennington - Ah-mazing!

We went to another cafe instead. The spark had been ignited and my curiosity would not get the best of me. I strategically planned my next attempt. I called and found out that the bakery is open late, so when I got off of work at 8pm, I headed over to them. Luckily it was a rainy friday night and there were a few people in the bakery. <br><br>As I made my way to the cupcakes, my mouth nearly dropped. They had so many that I had to order one of each basic flavor. Then I saw the specials (which change all the time) and I had to have the peanutbutter frosting, red velvet and the oreo. By the time, I got to the register the woman asked how I wanted my regular cupcakes frosted. I mustve looked puzzled because she explained that the specials were as is, but the regular cupcakes, I could choose the frosting, so I told her, give me different kinds, as i explained that it was my first time here. She rang my order up, $32.00/dzn wow!!!! I paid, and then looked up at the prices lol. Go figure, this would be my splurge. <br><br>I got home and i cut them all in quarter pieces n each day would try one slice of each cupcake. Yes, i did share with family. I was more fond of the buttercreme frosting. The red velvet, yellow cupcake with white or chocolate buttercreme frosting is so good. Its def not a place to go all the time, its perfect for a splurge or celebration.<br><br>Years later, I am still fond of this place. So much that, now that I work at Rush, I always talk about this place.

It is to the point where if you don't like Molly's, I'm not sure if we can be friends...<br><br>All joking aside, I absolutely swear by Molly's Cupcakes. I love cupcakes, and everywhere I travel, I seek out the little confections. These are not only the best ones I've had in Chicago, but anywhere I've been! I used to live in Hyde Park, and before I had a car, I almost shed a tear when I realized I lived one mile outside of their 10 Â mile delivery radius. Do I camp out in a closet a mile north a la Elaine Benes from Seinfeld? Since that didn't work out too well for her, I would make the long bus and train journey to Lincoln Park just for these fabulous little cupcakes. Now that I have a car, I circle and circle around the neighborhood looking parking just to go this bakery. Whenever my friends are visiting from out of town, I bring them here. If a friend of mine is having a bad day, I know one sure way to cheer him/her up!<br><br>This cafe is decorated whimsically. Even though it's small, its filled with bright and cheery colors and have cute swing-seats by the bar. The employees are always bubbly, chatty, and friendly, even when the store is swamped with costumers. They serve Intelligentsia coffee here, so its a nice place to hang out for a quick afternoon sip and snack.<br><br>And then there are those cupcakes. I think I have tried each and every one at this point, and my favorite changes periodically. In general, I prefer the cupcakes with filled centers. My current favorite is the butterscotch carmel, which is very buttery, fluffy, and not too sweet. Another favorite for when you've got a craving for not one, but two nut spreads is the peanut butter nutella. It has a peanut butter cake and frosting and is filled with rich nutella. A unique pick is the blueberry cheesecake (a cupcake filled with cheesecake?! The charming, sweet cousin of the turducken!) or the cake batter if you are a lover of more simple flavors. To be honest, you can't go wrong with any flavor, they are all wonderful!<br><br>And with this review, I have professed my undying love! Molly's is a spot not to be missed!

Also not too sweet, it complements the frosting on top to create a flavorful explosion in your mouth.

I went with the cream cheese frosting, and let's just say you can't fault Molly's for false advertising.

Not the case at Molly's - the cupcakes are practically begging you to take a bite.<br><br>This place gets excellent marks for its friendly service, charming interior and exterior, excellent prices, and of course, delicious cupcakes.

Pricing for filled cupcakes were like $3.75 and then regular cupcake prices vary by size. <br>$20 for 4 cupcakes?

If you offer delivery, that seems like a pretty easy thing to change. I'm pretty sure Dominos can do that.

Even with that additional charge, it was an excellent value. <br>-Nicole promptly replied to e-mails and answered all of our questions. <br><br>Which cupcakes did we choose, you ask? After a intense cupcake tasting and much discussion with with our mouths filled with cupcakes, we chose three different kinds of regular sized cupcakes for our guests.

Two of the Megas sat at the top of our cupcake tower. The third Mega cupcake was frozen to celebrate our one year wedding anniversary. For our Megas, we chose the Ron Bennington (peanut butter filling) and the Mixed Berry (fresh berry puree filing). <br><br>Molly's also creates cakes, but we opted not to do a traditional cake. <br><br>I highly recommend choosing Molly's Cupcakes for your wedding cupcake needs!

Chocolate cake with a choc. mouse filling and chocolate frosting. He enjoyed it.

Okay, confession: sometimes we go out of our way to walk by Molly's for a sweet treat.

It's our go-to dessert spot. <br><br>So, when the time came to start thinking about dessert at our wedding, we tossed around a few other ideas, but kept coming back to Molly's. We called them and they set up a tasting, which was SO fun. Basically, they bring out a gigantic tray of cupcakes and you get to try them all- which was amazing and kind of dessert overload, but in a good way! Though we tried lots of flavors, we decided to go with our tried and true favorites. Molly's was nice enough to turn his fave into a sheet cake, which would be served at the end of dinner alongside my red velvets as mini-cupcakes. <br><br>However, our experience w/Molly's didn't end there. As we were wrapping up planning our wedding, we were trying to figure out a fun favor to send home with our guests. We figured, why not give a late night snack. For this, Molly's created mini cookies for us in a variety of flavors that they individually shrink wrapped. They also did all of the legwork for us, placing these shrink wrapped treasures in cute bags sealed with stickers we provided for them. And they let us come in for a second tasting, just to try cookies, too. <br><br>Dessert was a HUGE hit with our guests- some even came up to us asking if there was more cake or cookies in back they could steal.

Â The cake was soft and well-cooked, but neither the chocolate or vanilla flavor stood out, leaving me confused for the flavor they were trying to go for.

Â The filling aside, the worst of the worst by far was the frosting. Â I don't know how they made it, but it tasted like it was some sort of combination of buttercream not made from real butter mixed with whipped up heavy cream. Â I don't know how to describe the flavor other than describing it as being \"off\". Â It was sweet, but it was also mildly sour like fruit or vegetables that have been left out too long.

The texture was more like whipped cream than frosting, so much so that I just checked the website to make sure it WASN'T. <br><br>The butterscotch filling was also just as bad.

I'm familiar with Molly's, so I decided to order 24 cupcakes for the party I'm hosting back at home. I ordered the cupcakes online the night before, assuming the transaction went through. The next morning, I wake up to an email stating that my cupcake order has been cancelled. The email had no sort of explanation at all. I called the cupcake shop, and the lady explained to me that they cancelled my order because \"it was made late at night.\" The website had no disclaimer stating you cannot order at night for the cupcakes to be ready the next morning. <br><br>Disregarding the complications of ordering the cupcakes the first time, I decided to reorder them. On my way home after picking up the cupcakes, I realized that 3/4 of the cookie monster cupcakes that I purchased were not decorated with a cookie on top (the cupcake is always decorated with a cookie on top to make it look pretty).These cupcakes were mainly purchased for the neatness and quality that I experienced before. These cupcakes were definitely not clean, and it looks like they hurried to get them done. By means, I paid $3.75 for each cupcake (I purchased 24: $90 order). Just a suggestion: If one is paying that much money for one cupcake, you might want to make them look good. The fact that they cancelled my first order, and I still had the confidence to reorder the cupcakes, and they ruined that order, shows their lack of carelessness towards their customers. <br><br>I decided to give the cupcake shop a call to inform them of this matter. The lady on the phone was confused about my concern and seemed uneducated about the business and \"their standards.\" She said, \"I know our cupcakes are smaller in size today, but are cupcakes are made fresh everyday.\" First of all, I was not concerned with the size of the cupcakes, but thanks for telling me that they're smaller than usual. <br><br>I explained to her again of the issue, and she put me on hold for a good 10 minutes. Another employee, or I'm assuming it was the store manager, picked up the phone and asked how she can help me. I'm more then sure she already knew what had happened. After explaining my self for the 3rd time, the store manager asked me what I would like her to do for me. I asked for some kind of reimbursement for those cupcakes Â due to the fact that I was an hour away from the shop, and I could not go back to get new ones. The lady then told me that she can not give me any sort of reimbursement due to the fact that I did not pay for the cookie and that the only reason they put the cookie on the cupcake is to be nice (Not true; The cupcakes are always decorated with a cookie on top). I then explained to the lady that only 1 out of the 4 cupcakes had that decorative element to it. I explained to her that it looks dumb and unprofessional. She then told me that I could just take the cookie off of the other cupcake. That's when I got really upset. The lady clearly thought it was funny that I was complaining about such matter, but what she did not understand is that I paid that much money for neat, decorative cupcakes. I then told her that she was no help and hung up the phone. The lady made NO effort at all to reach me, even after realizing how upset I was.<br><br>As small as this situation may look, this business CLEARLY does not care for their customers and is CLEARLY only concerned with the profit component of the business. Although their cupcakes taste good, their lack of customer service, neatness, and inability to get things done RIGHT proves their carelessness towards their customers.

It was bad. It was severe. And when asked what kind of cupcake I specifically wanted I, without hesitation answered, \"Molly's Cupcakes--chocolate cupcake with peanut butter filling, chocolate frosting, and Butterfinger crumbles.\" Oh good Lord did I want, nay--NEED that cupcake. But alas it was late, and Molly's, although only a short walk away, was closed. So my cupcake craving was denied. <br><br>In the last few years a lot of cupcake places have popped up in Chicago and many have been really good (Sweet Mandy B's) and many have been bad (Cupcakes! on Briar/Broadway--great flavors but too dry and poorly executed). But for me, Molly's takes the cake (ZING! I've GOT to be the first person to make that joke, right?). The cake itself is nice and moist, the frosting is rich but not too heavy. Being something of a sweets aficionado I have come to know that my favorite type of butter cream frosting is easy on the butter and heavy on the creamy. Molly's is just that. Creamy but not heavy. Not like eating a stick of butter which in theory sounds awesome but in practice is kind of gross.<br><br>The space itself is adorable. I chatted with an employee shortly after they opened and she told me that the owner started the business in homage to an elementary school teacher who would bake amazing cupcakes for all the kids on each of their birthdays (I believe Molly's may even use that exact recipe). CUTE! So to bring back that feeling of childhood Molly's is decorated as a kid friendly space--board games, colorful decor, wooden swings at the bar, a cupcake decorating station. The employee told me that the wood itself (for the swings and other pieces of decor) is actually pulled from the floors of a local elementary school. I don't know if that's true or not but I like to think it is which is why I'm repeating the rumor here.<br><br>Furthering their commitment to kids and education, Molly's donates a portion of their proceeds to local schools. How awesome is that? Super awesome!<br><br>So if you're in the mood for a cupcake and you're in the Lincoln Park area be sure to hit Molly's. I know it's a bit pricier than some cupcake joints but it's just so delightful. The cupcake you get will be definitely worth the money and some of that money will go to help a local school.

Â Utilizing fine ingredients, supporting a good cause, featuring a \"sprinkles station,\" and allowing you to design your own cupcake in addition to their daily selections seemed like a can't-miss combo - largely it was. Â While cupcakes were pricey and the lack of parking was a tad annoying, the customer service was great, the store was kitschy, and the selections were unique - blending the same Intelligentsia I experienced at Alinea that evening (at $3 instead of $8) I regret not getting a cup.<br><br>Selecting our cupcakes, 6 in total, only one was consumed right away while the others were eaten throughout the next 24 hours. Â An overarching theme of all the cakes is the fact that the quality of the ingredients DEFINITLEY shined through - much like Kara's in SF. Â Each cupcake had great frosting to cake ratio, the cakes held up well to bite and knife, and the cake itself was moist without drying out despite the delay in eating. Â The first cupcake tasted was the Cookee Monster - a wonderful vanilla cake filled with raw cookie dough and topped with a mild buttercream frosting and small cookie. Â I ate it solo and was glad to do so.<br><br>The subsequent cupcakes were eaten as a \"tasting\" of sorts after a post-lunch nap...sort of a pre-Alinea snack, if you will. Â With each divided into quarters we sampled first the Red Velvet with Cream Cheese frosting -Easily a top-5 Red Velvet option with a significantly sour cream cheese frosting that really set off the cocoa in the cupcake. Â While not quite as good as the version at Bouchon, I'd place it on par with the choices at Two Little Red Hens or Grandma Freida's as second best - the frosting REALLY worked.<br><br>Following the Red Velvet was Boston Cream - good texture and flavor but really not all that memorable, lemon-meringue - I demolished this attempting to cut it but found the extremely intense lemon cake very well balanced against the creamy and airy meringue, and Peanut Butter Nutella - excellent but so Peanut Buttery that the Nutella was largely overwhelmed - had I gone into it with different expectations I'd have thought \"Damn, that is an AWESOME peanut butter cupcake.\" Â The final cupcake, the Ron Bennington, I actually did not taste as my family finished it while I was at Alinea - but I am told it was good too.<br><br>All told I quite liked Molly's, but found the price to be just a tad excessive. Â While the cupcakes at Bouchon are similarly priced, they are larger and for about 1/2 the price of Molly's a place like Grandma Freida's or Two Little Red Hens serves an equally good if not better cake.

I clarified, \"So if I come in around 5:00 this evening there will be a dozen red velvets for me to buy?\" Yes, is what she said. She wouldn't let me order them, she was so confident. (I should've listened to my gut) Well, you can see where this is going. I show up around 5:00 and the cases look empty. Â I order my dozen and she tells me they only have 9. No more coming, as today was unexpectedly busy. I explain my phone call earlier in the day, but no dice. She asks what other flavors do I want, no offer to discount my order or allow me to upgrade to the more expensive type of cupcakes. So I order 3 more chocolate cupcakes and a coffee. She gives me the coffee for free, so that was something.<br>So, the taste. Wow, the red velvet was good, particularly the frosting. Possibly even just the frosting, but it was good enough I didn't care. Then the chocolate cake with chocolate frosting - meh, not so much. The cake was a bit dry and the frosting was too sweet, not enough chocolate taste, and all around reminds me of the grocery store cake version of chocolate frosting. It was the totally opposite of the cream cheese frosting, which was decadent and rich, huge flavors of cream cheese without being too sweet or overpowering.<br>I would most likely go back and try some of the filled cupcakes, but maybe avoid ones with chocolate.

Â The store was busy, they didn't have time to answer our questions, the girl behind the cupcake counter had a rotten attitude so we said, \"Ok, no big deal, they're busy, we'll try back again another time.\" Â So we just went with a berry cupcake and took it home with us. Â (The girl at the register, fyi, had a great attitude. She should have been serving the customers the cupcakes.)<br><br>So a couple days later I went back. Â I went out of my way on a Monday evening to travel from the suburbs by public transit just to get my family some of these cupcakes everyone is raving about. Â After my 3 + hour commute, I was really looking forward to some great customer service at Molly's. Â I walked in the store, and I was the only one there in line! Â I went right to the counter eager to ask all kinds of questions about the cupcakes, and I had the same girl who just simply said, \"Do you know what you want?\" Â I was attempting to ask my questions, with the girl at the counter just looking annoyed, not answering me, then some customers came in behind me. Â I didn't want to take up anyone's time, but at the same time my questions weren't being answered. Â The girl behind the counter curtly said, \"we do make them how you want them. Â if you don't know what you want step aside and let the other customers order.\" Â Not wanting to hold up the line, I just quickly ordered the mix and match cupcakes (vanilla cake, chocolate frosting) and a few others. Â She rushed me over to the register and I said calmly, \"Oh, please make sure you put alot of frosting on.\" Â I'm not sure if she heard me, but the line was piling up behind me for people to pay, so I didn't worry about it. Â I trusted the cupcakes would be worth it. Â The girl hands me the box, and I had to ask for a bag, which was a problem seeing that she rolled her eyes when I asked for a bag. Â I said, \"I'm sorry to bother you for a bag, but I have to take 2 buses and 2 trains with these cupcakes.\" Â <br><br>So far, I felt like I was just a bother to the employees, and definitely not a welcome customer. Â The people in there behind me were regulars, they didn't have any questions, which seems to make the process easier, understandably, but this is a service business, so there needs to be good customer service.<br><br>NOW, I got home after my long train ride, greeted my husband and son with the box of cupcakes we had all been looking forward to (I hadn't opened them at this point.) Â When I opened them the order was entirely wrong. Â I asked for specific pairings of cake and frosting, half of the cupcakes had literally a 1.5 inch diameter x 4mm height of frosting on them. Â My son looked at them and said, \"that's it?\" Â We're all too familiar with the massive amount of frosting Magnolia, Crumbs, and Sprinkles. Â (The customer service we have received at the mentioned cupcake bakeries was great, by the way, despite how busy these places get.)<br><br>I emailed <a href=\"mailto:info@mollyscupcakes.com\">info@mollyscupcakes.com</a> and had a useless discussion with the GM. Â I won't name anyone, but this general manager showed absolutely zero understanding that they messed up my cupcakes, and the attitudes were terrible. Â She didn't even offer to replace them. Â She spent all her time in the emails back and forth being defensive, saying, \"oh, I'll look into it, surely this can't be possible, we don't receive *any* complaints as you can see from our reviews.\" Â I then responded, \"It is very possible as with many customers who've had bad experiences that many don't bother to take the time to write a letter about it or discuss the issue. Â Instead people who've had bad experiences just end up telling their friends about it.\" Â  <br><br>So as of now, I'm awaiting a response from the GM of Molly's. Â She could have really mended this situation, but she just steered me in the opposite direction, I couldn't run any faster from this place. Â I will stick to the many other cupcake bakeries in the city and burbs that offer great cakes made correctly AND great customer service.<br><br>My husband and I will be sure to tell our friends to stay away. Â My husband buys pastries and such for his employees bi-weekly, so we're always looking for new places to buy large quantities of pastries/cupcakes from.

The great thing about Molly's is the mini cupcakes if you want to sample. The day I was there, they offered chocolate, vanilla, red velvet, and carrot. The bad thing about Molly's is I think they may be spreading their skills too thinly. They do have quite a bit of variety, but everything was mediocre bordering on bad, except the brown butter frosting. That's a winner. The birthday cake cupcake was lame. The cream cheese frosting on the carrot and red velvet cake tasted like straight whipped butter.

Okay, so don't tell my boyfriend, but a man who makes cupcakes for a living and who can come up with the brilliant idea of a \"Sprinkle Station\" ...? LOVE. At first bite, that is. <br><br>I recently visited Chicago for a whopping five days, and all five days I noshed some delicious Molly's Cupcakes. I give you, a sampling of these days of orgasmic cakey goodness.<br><br>1. The Triple Berry: Hopefully I'm getting the name right, but this cupcake was outstanding. It was a yellow-ish cake with a creamy berry center and purple berry icing and fresh berries on top. The cake was soft, spongy, and absolutely decadent, but not too rich to knock me completely off my feet. It was just enough to, well, get me hooked. If you like fresh berries, this cake's for you.<br><br>2. The classic Red Velvet: The test of a good bakery is how they can do up Red Velvet. Luckily, Molly's has this classic cake down. The red velvet was soft and moist, and the frosting was classic and creamy. Thumb's up!<br><br>3. The Vegan yellow cake with chocolate frosting: YUM. A vegan cake this good should be outlawed. Better yet, it should be sold as a regular cupcake so people don't know that they're eating something so healthfully delicious. It was uber moist and the frosting was soooo creamy and good. I don't know how they do it, but WOW.<br><br>4. The CINNAMON ROLL cupcake: Seriously? A cinnamon roll cupcake? Let me describe how I ate this ... I pealed off the paper, and took layer by layer off the cupcake (yes, it's like a cinnamon roll), swinging it through the creamy frosting on top so that EVERY bite was filled with the delicious frosting. This was better than any regular cinnamon roll I've ever had. CHEERS to you guys. I could eat this for breakfast EVERY day.<br><br>The place is adorned with childhood favorites -- board games, swings that you can sit on while enjoying your cupcakes, and even signs on the doors of the bathroom that ring of elementary classroom days. Overall, this place is HOPPING with fun and childhood goodness. Where else in Chicago can you feel THIS much like a kid while also enjoying gourmet, hip-style cupcakes that won't break the bank?<br><br>Nowhere. That's where.

Â I believe what it was was pure, whipped creamed cheese with no other ingredients added. Â I'm sure I'm probably wrong, but the bottom line is where's the sweetness?

I haven't gone enough to try everything yet...good thing too, my jeans wouldn't be able to take it...but so far the ones I have tried are delicious. The tiramisu and peach cobbler cupcakes were wonderful, probably my favorite. The staff is friendly and efficient. The giant swings at the counter are a nice touch, though I'll probably never use them just because I know I'll have a \"moment\" and kill myself by leaning too far back, which just wouldn't end well. <br><br>So, why only three stars? First, let's face it...they're cupcakes. They are delicious, but not particularly novel, and I find $4 per cupcake a little hard to take. But baking isn't cheap either, so I'm not holding it against them. The lower rating comes more from the issue of how the place is laid out. I'm sure space is an issue, but it seems to take a bit of a dance to get around to the cupcakes, then to your table. Add the possibility of having coffee or tea, in which case you need to get yourself to the cream and sugar station that is right in the middle of everything. And when it's crowded, that tends to get a little precarious and tricky. I get nervous weaving around people with a full cup of hot coffee. <br><br>But really, overall, I enjoy stopping here when we're in the area.

Â We had originally intended to have one huge cake-like tier but then opted instead to put the cupcakes on cupcake tiers at each table as centerpieces. Â We didn't have a single color theme at our wedding (wedding party wore black and ivory), so we decided that for the cupcake centerpieces, we wanted a mix of colors to liven up the room. Â I am also vegan and really wanted to have vegan cupcakes - and had heard good things about Molly's vegan baked goods. Â We did a mix of chocolate and vanilla and five different frosting colors. Â The colors turned out to be so vibrant and look AWESOME on the tiers. Â I cannot say enough how absolutely perfect the colors were! Â <br><br>And, having \"edible\" centerpieces went over very well :). Â We got so many compliments on how tasty the cupcakes were - from those who knew they were vegan and those who didn't! Â Many people noted that they were just the right texture and sweetness - not so rich that you can't finish one but still very yummy (and many people admitted to eating more than one and wanting to try both flavors!). Â <br><br>I myself am not a huge sweets fan, but I've sampled a lot of vegan baked goods in my life and know that some people/places figure out vegan baking and do an amazing job but other places either just don't know the art of vegan baking or don't put much effort into their vegan products knowing they won't be as popular. Â Molly's has DEFINITELY put a lot of effort into making their vegan cupcakes something to be proud of... and even though I'm not that much of a sweets-eater, I myself downed quite a few :). Â I'd definitely recommend Molly's to other vegans looking for cupcakes for a big event or just to enjoy with a few friends...and the vegan cupcakes are definitely NOT the sort of thing that only your other vegan friends will enjoy. Â Great for mixed herbivore/omnivore crowds!<br><br>Also, I had been advised that the vegan cupcakes may not last as long outside of refrigeration (that is, that they'd be perfectly safe to eat but the frosting may lose some volume and not look as appealing)...but we opted to put them on centerpieces a couple hours before the wedding/reception started anyway because we didn't want to save all the set-up until ten minutes before our ceremony (ceremony and reception was all in one room). Â They held up perfectly for the entire night. Â <br><br>Because we were using them as centerpieces, we ordered many more than we needed to feed the amount of people we had. Â We knew we'd have extras going into it, and it was awesome to see so many people take some home. Â It made us happy, since we didn't have to waste food/money, and it was also a nice testament to how good they were (people wanted more!!). Â Also, my parents took a couple dozen leftover cupcakes to my grandma's senior center the next day, and they had held up perfectly, and they were a huge hit! <br><br> I couldn't be more happy about how they looked, how they tasted, and how they fit so perfectly in the tiers we had bought and made awesome decoration and snack and favor! Â (Our only regret is that because so many people wanted to take them, we didn't end up with that many leftovers ourselves...but Molly's did include a cute box with the assortment intended for us to freeze for our first anniversary, much like people would do with the top of the wedding cake - that was a neat touch!)<br><br>Also, I should mention that the delivery was right on time (and on a Sunday, much appreciated!), and every step of the process of ordering was super easy. Â I was able to do a lot by email and had one meeting at Molly's with Kat (who was great to work with) to talk about the general plan. Â The price for our bulk order with our request for vegan cupcakes in two-flavors and five frosting colors was TOTALLY REASONABLE.

Yay, cupcakes!!<br><br>Went I entered I was surprised to see tables and that they had drinks. The cute little swings from the ceiling to sit on in front of the counter were original and cute. This isn't a bakery, it's a cupcake cafe. Â <br><br>So, the main cool thing at the cupcake cafe is that you can build your own cupcake. Get Out!!! You can pick your cake, then your frosting. Â You can get toppings for a quarter or so. Being the cupcake-monster that I am, I got two. 1) red velvet, cream cheese frosting, brownie bits topping. Â Ok, I wasn't really a fan of the frosting for this one, nor the cake. The cake was moist and had good quality, but both the cake and frosting were a little too tart for me. Â The brownie bits were more like chunks though, which of course made me happy. Â  2) chocolate cake, french buttercream frosting, chocolate chips toppings. Â I was very pleased with this one. The french buttercream reminded me of french vanilla ice cream.<br><br>At $2 for the regular sized cupcakes, and $1 for the poppers, I think you definitely get your money's worth. Â You can also get cupcakes with filling in the center for $3.75, not my cup-o-tea though. Â Better than Sweet Occasions, but doesn't top Cupcakes. However, with Cupcakes' prices and lack of beverage offering, this would be my frequent cupcake spot for when I just want a good cupcake w/a hot beverage.
