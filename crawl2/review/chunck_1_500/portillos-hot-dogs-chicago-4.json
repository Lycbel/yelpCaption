There have to be at least 30 people working there at any given time from the register to cooking to sending out orders. <br><br>To be fair, I didn't get the chance to try a beef from anywhere else in Chicago while I was visiting, I'm just glad my first experience(s) was super tasty.<br><br>P.S. don't miss out on the cheese fries!

Portillo's is popular here in Chicago for that. So we walked 15mins in the cold for it.<br><br>This location is very lit up at night. Made me feel safe. Once you enter, it's decorated real well! I felt the Christmas spirit. All the lights and colors made my heart happy. <br><br>We went around 11:30PM, so the lines were very short. My husband and I were taking our time looking over the menu and the cashier was a little rude and impatient with us, even though we let people go in front of us so we wouldn't hold the line. After debating, we decided to order the Jumbo Hot Dog with everything (basically a Chicago dog) and Italian beef sandwich.<br><br>The hot dog tasted really good!! I thought the flavor profile was there. The taste was \"married together\" if that makes sense. But the buns were wimpy. It didn't hold. For some reason, it was soggy and falling apart. We did not like that.<br><br>The Italian beef here was okays. The flavor didn't wow me. I've had Italian beef sandwich before and this one wasn't as good as the other one I ate. I felt like they used the wrong bread because the bread didn't hold the juice well. It started to get soggy and come apart too!! We didn't even eat half of it because of that factor. It just felt like a big let down.<br><br>So in my opinion, only come for the hot dog. Hopefully your buns will stay intact!!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "My boyfriend and I came here for late night eats around 2am. There was still a good size line and a little bit of a wait.

My friend was right, this hot dog was good! It tasted very fresh and had a nice snap to it, not like other pork hot dogs I'm used to.

I just got a chicago dog and ended up waiting close to half an hour. I also got a strawberry shake and for some reason it wasn't ready by the time I picked up my hot dog. Which isn't a huge deal, but there wasn't synchronization. Like no one behind the line communicated so that everything can be ready at once. It isn't like drinks take that long. Honestly, it just seems like there was a lot of goofing around behind the line. Maybe that's why orders take so long. I'm not saying don't have fun at work. Just don't be goofing around if you know you got a packed house. <br><br>For my Chicago dog, it was a sad soggy hot dog. I could barely pick it up to take a bite before it all fell apart. And I know why it was soggy! The dogs are sitting in a big water bath to be kept warm. Yum right? And the guys behind the line just takes the dogs directly from the pool and just slaps it onto the bun without really shaking the excess water off.

The hot dog itself was just okay. It would have been nice if it had more flavor but it was good enough to hold up to everything else.<br><br>The Italian beef was fine but not a ton of flavor and I had it because you're told you had to have it. But I think most people can skip it and maybe go to Philadelphia and get a Philly cheese steak which is far superior.<br><br>The chocolate cake shake was RICH. Basically they took a chocolate cake and blended it into a shake. It was good but you can't have one by yourself or else you'll feel sick.<br><br>Finally, we had a beer because...why not?

Italian beef was so messy with the extra gravy we got dripping everywhere but so tasty! Rarely had meat this tender. We also got a hot dog which was good but not that special.

This is a light beer with a slightly tart/acidic end note making it great to cut all the delicious fatty foods.<br><br>3.) Jumbo dog- 4 stars. Go jumbo, bc you need the extra meat to fill all that bread! Came with Xmas green colored relish, onions, 2 chilis, mustard, and a quartered pickle. It was good but not as good as the chili dog or pasta. Sorry Portillos. P.s. I would have liked my pickle crunchier.<br><br>4.) Chili dog- 4.5 stars, the dog and bun were good but ordinary.

Once I finished ordering is where the fun began. <br><br>They gave you a number and then you walk over to the pickup area with the massive crowd. We waited a good 50 mins for our food. Portillos is supposed to be fast food...I know they were swamped, but they had NOOOOO system in place and no one knew what to do besides the locals. Portillos has probably about 80% tourists visiting so I can't fault them for not knowing any better. Since the wait was so long, I thought I ought to buy a beer. It took me and my buddy about 20 mins just to get a beer when I was the 2nd person in line waiting for a beer. The employees behind the counter never once told me, \"I'll be with you shortly\" or even acknowledged my existence. I was seriously like, \"Do you want my money?\"<br><br>The woman before me ordered a catering order and of course it was wrong so she had to wait even longer too delaying my date with my Daisy Cutter. To make things worse, when I finally got my order, my order wrong when I ordered a chocolate cake shake not a piece of chocolate cake. Also, my sandwich wasn't dipped like I asked, which was very disappointing. Since I waited for so long, it wasn't even worth it to complain because I was starving. I think the only capable employees at Portillos were the cooks and the employees shouting out numbers. <br><br>So overall, I would not come back to this location due to the service. Take my review with a grain of salt because my buddies and I made the mistake of coming to Portillos on a weekend. Service was a 0 and food was only like a 3 since I had the wrong order and the sandwich wasn't even dipped. The chocolate cake was the only satisfying part of the experience...Go to another Portillos location or Al's down the street.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7FmVWNPHZdLpjOg0646YgQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Undipped Italian Beef with unmelted mozzarella cheese... :("}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OAbfeg4-N2VYPbyd3Wdu1Q/168s.jpg", "caption": "Only satisfying part of the experience"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Seriously??

The staff will direct you to the correct line, writes your order on a paper bag, then hands them to the cashier. While you get funneled towards the pick-up line, you can watch the \"behind the scenes\" fast action from the see-through glass. This kitchen line really hustles to churn out orders with extreme efficiency. Just don't record because the managers don't allow it.<br><br>We both got the Chicago hotdogs and side of fries.

We ordered a cajun chicken pita*, an Italian beef sandwich and a cheese and beef sandwich with peppers with fries. The cajun chicken had a spicy kick to it. I got it with tomato, and lettuce. It was really good but I was unable to finish it. The chicken was white meat and cooked where it was still juicy. The pita bread had a a bit of crisp to it. The Italian beef was just the way I remembered  when I lived in Chicago. The beef was nice and tender it just needed to be dipped and of course I forgot my peppers. How did I make that mistake? The cheese and beef croissant was new for me. We asked for peppers for that extra kick. It was actually really good. The croissant had a nice flaky crust but was soft on the inside. It actually seem to be an Italian beef to me but just on a croissant. The fries were also good. Nice and crispy. I thought I was hungrier than I really was because I couldn't finish everything. The only problem I had was that they totally forgot about my cajun chicken pita. However, when they realized there mistake they immediately started preparing it.

We went at 1 pm on Saturday and the large space was packed. There were two long lines to order food and multiple stations to pick up the food depending on what you ordered. The line took around 20 minutes which wasn't terrible but waiting for the food was. We were a large group of 7 so we had a big order but it took almost 40 minutes for us to get everything. The main pick up location could definitely use some lean reorganization because calling out numbers to a mob of people cannot be the best way to do it. The ladies were nice though and got us a couple of the items we were missing from our order very quickly.<br><br>Now to the food itself. Italian beef is amazing. I don't even like meat that much and I ate one and a half sandwiches myself. I just wish that they didn't dip the sandwiches ahead of time especially since we asked for the sauce on the side but I guess that's a result of the assembly food line in the back. Predipped sandwiches that sit make for mushy bread blegh. Also ask for the Italian beef with hot peppers for a better balance. Italian sausage was also hearty and good but I wish it came with the toppings like the Chicago dog does. I'm not a big hot dog person so the Chicago dog didn't impress me. The chopped salad was surprisingly really good and added a nice balance to our heavy meal. Cheese fries were pretty standard. The highlight of the meal and maybe my life is the chocolate cake shake. I absolutely love chocolate cake and apparently I love it in shake form because it means I can get more chocolate cake down in less time. I'll have to come back and compare it to the cake slice itself to see which one is the winner. <br><br>All in all, I can see why this is an iconic Chicago restaurant.

I've frequented a couple of their drive thru locations but have never been to this main restaurant. The interior has some very interesting and cool Chicago-themed decor, and I really enjoyed the flashy lights and expansive atmosphere of their atrium. The line also moved by really quickly, and my friend and I probably placed our order within 5 minutes even though we were probably 20th in line on arriving.<br><br>Hot dog - This will forever be the Platonic ideal of a Chicago style hot dog embedded in my memory. It's not necessarily the BEST out there, but it certainly always hits the spot and brings a smile to my face. I don't think I've ever gone to a Portillo's without getting one. Typically I get a jumbo size too - the extra meat on the dog is really nice!<br><br>Italian Beef w/ mozzarella cheese and hot peppers - WOW. This was sooooo good. I'm surprised I've never tried an Italian beef from a Portillo's before, and I'm sure this will become a fixture in my usual orders from here in the future. Get the style that they recommend on the menu, which is with extra gravy. Now, they don't really \"splash a bit of gravy\" on the sandwich per their menu - more like dump a small tub of gravy in it so it's soaking wet and hard to hold the sandwich without soaking your fingers. But MAN is it good. The beef, while not being the most flavorful itself, is so tender and juicy, and just feels amazing to sink your teeth into. Make sure to continue to dip your sandwich in that gravy to infuse it with even more juiciness. The melted mozzarrella and crunchy hot Giardiniera (not included as part of the basic sandwich) added some great textures and flavors as well, and I highly recommend getting the sandwich with these extra toppings.<br><br>Char-grilled Maxwell Street Style Polish - This was awesome! I've also somehow never tried this before. The sausage was extremely flavorful, and the dank succulent onions on top were SO juicy and filled with flavor. Just be ready to get some mad juicy burps after consuming this. I might just be disgusting (actually, I know I am), but I found these burps to be pleasant as each one reestablished a pleasant flavor in my mouth reminiscent of my delicious meal. Just make sure if you're going to get this you aren't around people you'd rather not be burping up juicy scents around.<br><br>Overall I've always enjoyed Portillo's and this site is no different. However, I do think somehow the quality of this location's food is actually better than that of other locations I've been to (although perhaps not by that much).

When they take your order, they ask for which peppers you want but do not tell you that it's an $0.60 charge so if you don't want it tell them no peppers! The jumbo dog was recommended by the staff but I wanted to try the max street so I got that one. The max dog was amazing! The outside of the hotdog was grilled and crisp and the inside was juicy! I also ordered a mint chocolate milkshake which was also good. The large size is huge so I recommend getting a small( it was enough for 2 people).

To start, this Portillo's was luckily within walking distance from the hotel I was staying at; that being said, parking looks like it would have been a nightmare with all the traffic and pedestrians. The Portillo's interior is unexpectedly large, with a massive seating area broken into small tables for four and an upper area for parties. The sound was deafening, as patrons and employees alike were yelling conversations and order numbers. I ordered a cake shake and ravioli, since I was pretty surprised that this place sold Italian food in addition to American staples like burgers and fries. After about fifteen minutes I picked up both for a pretty cheap combined price. The ravioli was okay, but it was doused in low-quality sauce that made it less appealing. What was worse was the cake shake, which tasted like chemicals, eggs and imitation chocolate. The thickness alone was unsettling, but the blended cake tasted unappealing too.

The dog was enclosed within a soft, poppy seed bun. The hot dog was delightful. One bite was a wonderful combination of different textures and flavors that blended together very well. I absolutely loved the different vegetables which gave the hot dog a great crunchy texture. The peppers added a nice kick of heat and the sausage was juicy.

We were in line when a lady staff asked us if we know what to order because if we do there was a quicker line for that, since we were newcomers we dont know what to get, she happily got us the menu and explained what are they famous for, we ordered Hotdog (with everything on it), Beef Italian Sandwich, we also got Chili Cheese Dog and Choclate Shake. She wrote our order in this paper bag and told us to give it to the lady in the cashier area. We gave it to the cashier lady, paid for it and the cashier instructed us to put the paper bag into the bin then somebody will call out  our number if the food is ready. <br><br>Okay, I admired the process, it looks chaotic inside but they have a process which surprisingly working well.

I am not sure if it comes with two serving or it was a mistake. Anyway, it was good, nothing special or wow factor that I havent tasted before but let me say the toppings goes very well with it. The bun was so soft and easy to eat. <br><br>Chilli Cheese Dog - Did not get the chance to taste this.<br><br>Italian Beef - this one for sure is bomb. For me it was big enough to make me full, the beef was juicy and tasty. <br><br>Chocolate Shake - Did not get the chance to taste this. <br><br>Serving Size - Based on the foods that we ordered, I say it depends. The hotdog was quite small but if it comes with two serving of hotdog then thats actually enough. Italian beef it was big and lots of beef in it.<br><br>Staff -  The lady who helped us because we looked like lost puppies, she was really nice and very patient even if the place was so busy, she did not rush us, she explained everything and how it works.<br><br>Price - Very Affordable<br><br>I will totally come back again, even if they were busy and kind the chaotic they were fast.

Owner and founder Dick Portillo invested $1,100 into a 6' x 12' trailer without a bathroom or running water. To get the water he needed, he ran 250 feet of garden hose from a nearby building into the trailer.<br><br>By 1966, \"The Dog House\" was a success and was ready for a new look. After it was remodeled, it was renamed \"Portillo's\" and over the years has grown into a successful multi-state operation. Portillo's expanded to Southern California in 2005 and to Indiana in 2006.<br><br>The Barnelli's Pasta Bowl concept was introduced in 1993, and features a variety of pastas with homemade sauces, gourmet salads, and hand-tossed pizza. Barnelli's first opened in Schaumburg and has additional locations in Naperville, Vernon Hills, Glendale Heights, Niles, Summit, Crystal Lake, Chicago and Willowbrook, IL.<br><br>In September 2000, Mr. Portillo launched a full service concept, Luigi's House, located on Route 59 in the Aurora/Naperville area. Luigi's House was inspired by Dick's trips to Italy and the Mediterranean. <br><br>Luigi's House and garden area have been meticulously designed to create the feeling of dining in a private Italian home, serving authentic traditional Italian cuisine in a cozy Italian/Mediterranean atmosphere. <br><br>Mr. Portillo launched his latest concept, Honey-Jam Cafe in May of 2010. There are currently three locations: one in Downers Grove, one in Batavia and a third in Bolingbrook. <br><br>Honey-Jam Cafe serves breakfast and lunch in a unique and upscale atmosphere you would not expect to find in a breakfast and lunch restaurant. Several of the items on the menu were discovered by Dick in different restaurants he visited during his travels throughout the United States and world. Each location has a unique open area where you can see homemade waffles being made, a separate carry-out area featuring brewed and specialty coffees \"to go\" as well as breakfast and lunch carry-out items. <br><br>Most of the décor, including the large double-sided fireplaces, was inspired by Dick's travels to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico and various locations throughout the United States.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Quality has gone was down since it was sold.

The beef was sliced super thin and the hot peppers I got for an addition $0.60 created such a perfect harmony of savory flavorful deliciousness.<br><br>I don't know if it's because I started off with the Italian beef and was slightly full, the Chicago dog was not as scrumptious and the Italian beef.

The hot dog was delicious but what separates it from your average hot dog were its accompaniments: half-sliced tomato sprinkled with diced pickles & onion nestled in a soft sesame bun. I ended up taking one to-go. And at $3, who could argue a second helping for that price? Moving on: I really enjoyed the Italian beef. No need to dress it up bc all it was was just lots of beef in a bun. Despite its simplicity, it was perfect in every way-- juicy and tender. What I could've done without was the chocolate cake milkshake. It taste like bits of cake were in it and although I'm all for decadence, this shake was overly sweet and one sip probably pushed my glucose levels over the edge.

It's not overwhelmingly strong and so fresh (not pickled!!), I was surprised that the mildly sour bite was solely from the pickle and not also from the relish. What a delight of textures! and of course, I've never had a hot dog I didn't have to smother in ketchup...This time, sauces couldn't be farther from my mind as the toppings already on the hot dog dangerously threatened to overflow everywhere and the different flavors (salty from the dog, sweet from the onions, sour from the pickle) made the otherwise underwhelming concept of a hot dog the best thing to happen to me that day. <br><br>The italian beef was also a first for me, and don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but against the crisp, colorful hot dog, it was just a soggy monochromatic mush in comparison. <br><br>Tuna sandwich was a little dry and pungent (the fishiness is REAL, guys, and definitely not for people who don't like the fishy taste) and chicken caesar salad was nothing remarkable, but because the hot dog was so great (it's all I can think about as you can clearly tell) this place deserves a visit whether you're from Chicago or not.<br><br>just get the hot dog, guys.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I've been to a lot of Portillo's.  This one screwed up my order twice and then they got angry with me about the malt shake.

Sorry...not sorry.<br><br>The food itself isn't bad, and probably a good option for a quick, tasty bite. At first glance everything seems cheap but the portions are small and you get charged extra for things like hot peppers and sweet peppers (additional charges each). The $5.69 Italian Beef sandwich easily becomes $7-$8. Without the add ons though, the food would be really plain and lacking in flavor. I just wish that was clear up front so I wouldn't feel like I'd been bamboozled into spending ~$15 on what I thought was going to be a cheap meal.<br><br>I had the Italian Beef sandwich which was good but not great. It was very greasy, and nothing special by itself. You have to add peppers to give it some flavor (and apparently you can add cheese too, but I didn't know that). My friend had a Chicago dog, which was only $2.85 but it was really small. I didn't try it because...I just didn't. My friend seemed rather disappointed though. I also had cheese fries, $3 for a large, but it was just regular fries with a side container of nacho cheese. I don't know...I really felt the food was over hyped and overpriced, like when you get charged a rip off amount for buying hot dogs and nachos etc. at a ball park game.<br><br>Lastly I had the Chocolate Cake Milkshake, which ended up costing more than their other shakes but I didn't know that until after (it's listed separately on the menu). It was $4.65 for a large versus $3.79 for their other shakes (including chocolate). It was good but too thick for my taste, it really just tasted like very chocolate-y ice cream to me. I didn't even bother finishing it. It just didn't wow me. Confession: I immediately went to Shake Shake afterwards for a shake, and I'm not ashamed to admit that.<br><br>I think if the workers taking our orders would have been friendlier and more helpful, then maybe we would have been happier with our orders.

It's a grilled hot dog in a poppyseed bun topped with a fat pickle slice, sport peppers, tomatoes, onions, mustard, relish, and celery salt. Something about this combination just works really well! The sport peppers were my favorite part, with the added little kick you'd get once in a while.<br><br>ITALIAN BEEF:<br>I was really excited to try the Italian beef here that I'd heard so much about. The sandwich consists only of beef on French bread, so we added cheddar and asked for some hot peppers on the side. The beef itself was very well seasoned and juicy, but after a few bites I was pretty tired of it. The bread got very soggy very quickly, which made it a lot less enjoyable. Adding the hot peppers (which are actually Giardiniera, or a mix of pickled vegetables that include sport peppers) helped give the sandwich a little variety.<br><br>ONION RINGS:<br>The onion rings were actually my favorite thing here. They're big, perfectly fried, and super crispy. Get these for sure!<br><br>Overall, I don't really get the hype. Yes, it's a tasty and cheap meal.

It is easy to make the mistake of passing Portillo's over. We made this mistake on our 2012 Chicago vacation. I think I yelped Rock Bottom instead. In two years I became educated on the greatness that is Portillo's. Recently my hometown paper the Las Vegas Review Journal asked their readers to chose the top ten fast food restaurants that they want to come to Las Vegas. Portillos is on that list: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.reviewjournal.com%2Ftrending%2Fsilver-state%2F10-restaurants-need-come-las-vegas&s=9f7d600b6a22cd5935fe4f5426f0cf8413c4d8f7cf4f906014d1a4a18d53b1c1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">reviewjournal.com/trendi…</a> <br><br>   The two floor building reminds me of museum dining. Historical Chicago memorabilia fills in the spaces of the two floors.We sat at a table that overlooked the chairs installed in the Chicago Stadium way back in the 1929. <br><br>   When you walk inside this Portillo's for the first time, the choices are overwhelming. It is easy to conclude that Bartella's and the rib eatery are all Portillo's. They are sister restaurants in the Portillo's restaurant group. The Portillo's is at the far end of the food court. The drawback to this design is that if you want ribs and hot dogs you will have to wait on one line, wait for the food, and repeat the process. <br><br>  The Portillo name drew crowds. On account of sharp management, the long cue moved fast. The neat thing is that when you are on the line you get to watch the employees cooking your food. I like that concept! I believe there is a sign by the window that says something in the tune of \"We have nothing to hide.\" Once you order, they give you a number. The misconception is that they serve the orders in numerical order. Not at Portillo's! There is even a sign stating that the food is not served in numerical order. Forget waiting for any number. How about sitting by a number. I am of the opinion that when you order that they give you a number to place at your table. Then when the food is ready, they'll bring it to your table. I prefer to look at the historical memorabilia to watching them cook the food.<br><br>  We dined in Portillo's two times a couple of weeks ago. My first dining experience was the jumbo hot dog with crinkly fries. The jumbo hot dog was served with a  superflous of toppings. They included a tomato and pickle. My second dining experience was the charbroiled 1/3 pound burger with onion rings. I rate this up there with the best burgers that I ate. The taste is comparable to Nathan's, which is currently one of my favorite fast food burgers. The savory onion rings were the tasty companion. The onion rings came in one size. Every bite was precious.<br><br>  It is tempting to use the Portillo's shipping service to have their hamburger shipped to my house. But nah. I'm optimistic that something better is shipping on down from Chicago to Las Vegas: our very own Portillo's.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/C0-3N1-SgNe7cnF2LJZ3Ug/348s.jpg", "caption": "Portillo's has nothing to hide.

They don't do combos either so just piece together a hot dog, crinkly fries and your drink. We also tried the Italian beef sandwich with green peppers and it was one of the best I have had. The prices are great too and the hot dogs are about $3 each. Once you get your food, you can seat in the open dining room downstairs. There are checkered tablecloths and all kinds of sports logos, bright lights and funky decor. We were there in December and it was also decorated with lights and a big tree.<br>You can also look at the menu and read about the history of Portillo's. There are numerous locations in the suburbs and this was the only one I saw in the heart of Chicago. If you want to bring the taste of Portillo's to your home, you can even order online and have a kit of hot dogs, bread and condiments shipped to your house.

I have been to Portillio's many times, every time I travel up to Chicago, I make it a priority to stop. <br><br>I have never eaten anything on the menu that is not-not good. The Italian beef truly melts in your mouth. The customer service for a restaurant as busy as this, is top notch, and the prices are even better. The moment you enter, employees are very friendly, and welcoming. Making the experience even better. Personally, every time I go to Portillio's I get several hotdogs and fries (known for their famous hotdogs). For one hotdog alone, the prices range from $1.50- $3.00, but for the quality of the dog, it is absolutely worth it. It is fun because you as the customer get to watch the employee's make the food since it is an open kitchen. The hotdogs are to die for, which is why I make sure to purchase several each time I visit. Which as a broke college student, I could not ask for any better prices. <br><br>The environment is one of a kind, it almost makes you feel like you're in old-time Italy, or old-time New Jersey, with the decor and music playing. The restaurant is one all year, so no worries about seasonality. Not the usual experience at most restaurants. As more of a tourist, I highly recommend other tourists to visit this local restaurant as one of their first eating joints. This place is not only for tourists, but an extremely popular place for localists to go on lunch breaks, or just in need of a good, cheap meal. <br><br>Despite the overwhelming amount of people who are waiting just as much as you, it is so worth it. The maximum amount of time I have ever waiting was maybe 7 minutes with a full restaurant, and believe me when you see how many people go out of their way just to get some Portillio's, that is pretty impressive timing. And the employees still manage to make the food better and better every time. With this, it should go to show how popular the dive is, and what customers will do to get an outstanding Portillio's meal.<br><br>Portillio's truly in my belief, defines Chicago.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "First Chicago dog I experienced.

Root beer with Italian beef is amazingly delicious! You can request for the bread to be dunked into the Italian beef sauce(?) but you don't really need to because the juiciness of the Italian beef gets absorbed by the bread anyway. The Italian beef sandwich is to die for! The beef is thinly sliced, juicy, and melts in your mouth! There is an abundance of beef! Yes sir, they do not skimp on the beef! It is piled on pretty high and eating the sandwich gets pretty messy, so get plenty of napkins! The fries were crisp and complimented the sandwich, oh and the root beer helped wash it down.

That's pretty much where my excitement ended. The fries were average, nothing special to rave about, no amazing unique seasoning on them, just an average french fry. The sandwich was served on good bread, the beef was good quality roast beef sliced thin and it was a decent beef to bread ration. It was well seasoned and had a good flavor... However, I could have made this sandwich at home and ended up with the same end result.

The massive piles of meet makes it super soggy but the stuff inside is legit. The italian beef is so thin and tender and legit. The last time I was impressed by some meat was at Katz in New York. The actual dog was juicy and flavorful. You cant go wrong with this combo.
