The wine selection is phenomenal, I actually found a new favorite wine there (our waitress brought out the bottle for me, so I could sneak a photo!) Make sure to try one of their signature cocktails. My choice was \"When the Livin's Easy\" (vodka, fresh strawberries, basil, lime, soda) and was the perfect summer cocktail to get your evening started. <br><br>The dinner menu was priced exactly what I would expect for a pretty nice place in downtown Chicago, but nothing extreme. If you want to get the filet or lobster however, then I'd bring the platinum ;) The dinner menu was fabulous. Appetizers ranged from $9-$21 (oysters, bison tartare, house poutine). If you are really hungry, I highly recommend the caesar salad. Hands down one of the best caesars I've ever had. If you fancy yourself a caesar, definitely order one (FYI big enough to split for two).<br><br>There was a pretty decent sized assortment of entrees ranging from $15-$65. The filet mignon was looking FABULOUS, but I was craving something lighter so I went with the fish of the day, which happened to be a mouth-watering Mahi-Mahi ($MP). Someone else in our party had the halibut ($35) and it was also a hit. Looking at other tables, everything on this menu is recommended to be honest. All of our plates were fabulous, and pretty decent portions as well. You won't leave hungry, that's for sure.<br><br>Overall: This is a great spot for both a nice happy hour after work with coworkers/friends OR a nice dinner out. We did both, so that works too ;) I'll throw in a great date spot as well. The lights are dimmed a little lower, so it definitely has a bit of a \"sexy\" vibe. You get the whole \"speakeasy\" vibe for sure with the jade colors on the walls, and art-deco flare. Great experience overall.

Gage Brothers & Co. supplied hats to fashionable ladies throughout the U.S. and abroad. The installation in the staircase to our lower level features original early 20th century theater magazine advertisements for Gage hats which were known for their<br>\"superb style, sterling quality and superior workmanship.\"<br><br>I enjoy coming here. It's a nod to the past while enjoying food and drink of the standard set by the previous occupants of the building.

The night was winding down for us so we asked for the check. As my husband was paying the $500+ tab, a patron at the next table -- sitting with a group of several others -- made a derogatory and racist comment to him: \"Why are you leaving? They don't have tacos on the menu?\" My husband, our friends, and I am Hispanic. The table of patrons who made this offensive, inappropriate, and completely uninstigated remark were caucasian. I feel gross even having to distinguish race/ethnicity here, but this is what occurred. In disbelief, my husband asked what the problem was. That's when another male member of their group quickly stood up with puffed chest, walking aggressively toward my husband as the group continued to make racial remarks. At this point the majority of our party was shocked and asking, \"What did they say? What's going on?\" The next thing I know, a waitress makes her way over and begins yelling at us to get out. We attempted to explain the situation to no avail. She continued yelling at us, calling over more waitstaff to back her up and make us leave -- which we were already doing to begin with! In a state of disgust and disbelief, we walked out and ordered our respective Ubers/Lyfts. We couldn't believe that we had been treated in such a humiliating manner, and the offending party sat at their table laughing at us. Unfortunately, at this point we had already payed our very pricey tab (with generous tip), so it must've been an easy call to kick US out rather than the instigators, who were still imbibing. Waitstaff continued to harass us as we waited for our cars outside, coming out to yell at us several time, \"Get out of here before we call the cops!\" The indignity of the situation was outrageous. We explained we were waiting for our rides and told them to go ahead and make the call. They told us we couldn't stand on the sidewalk outside the restaurant and that we had to wait somewhere else. We reminded them that the sidewalk is public property. A few minutes later three police officers arrived. This was actually a relief for us. We explained our side of the story and they were extremely understanding. They didn't give us a hard time, recognizing how ridiculous the situation was, and they also told us we could continue standing where we were (on the city sidewalk) to wait for our cars. <br><br>I have been to this establishment many, many times and have recommended it to others on countless occasions -- in fact, I recommended it to colleagues just two weeks ago. Never again. I am sick to my stomach with disgust at the demeaning way we were treated, especially compared to the way a table of racist, troublemaking individuals were treated. If you find this situation to be as gross as I do, I urge you not to support this establishment. I realize we're living in a climate where prejudiced people are emboldened to make cruel and hurtful remarks to plain strangers; I just didn't know The Gage supported this type of racist behavior. <br><br>Please tell others about this situation; I'm making sure to tell everyone I know.

Having four hours to fill, I figured I would visit The Gage for a second time and then go to Starbucks and read. Four hours, a good meal, great conversations, and a disappointing football game later, I left the Gage to catch my train home.<br>      On our fist visit we had the Poutine and it was amazing. The braised pork, the Poutine gravy made from the braised pork, the french fries, the choice of cheese curd,  and even the cut of the onions made it a meal worth coming back for. While we were there the server said we had to come back and try the scotch egg.<br>      On advice of my previous server, I started my meal with a Scotch Egg and a Rag to Riches. The Scotch Egg was everything I was hoping for. The housemade sausage, crispy coating, and perfectly cooked egg, served with whole grain and Dijon mustard was enough to leave me satisfied and wanting another one; then I saw the brunch menu. I was drawn to the Housemade Corned Beef Hash and  with the affirmation of Henry, my bartender, I ordered it.<br>      Let me talk about Henry and the other staff that I met for a minute. Henry was very polite, professional and friendly. As I watched him make my drink (I always watch bartenders as they make drinks and interact with customers), I was impressed with the fact that he stirred, tested with a straw and stirred again. My drink (Rags To Riches) was delicious and perfectly mixed with just the right amount of bitters and maple syrup, thanks to his concern for perfection. As I was sitting at the end of the bar I was close to a server station and had pleasant conversations with every staff member.<br>      Sitting a few stools down was a guy who ordered breakfast and an Irish Coffee. As I watched it being made with Jameson, coffee and hand shaken whip cream I was sold. I thanked the customer who ordered it for convincing me I needed \"coffee\" with my breakfast. After a normal conversation I find out that his name was Kevin and he was the general manager of operations and training for the Gage Hospitality Group (off the clock). I thanked him for caring about quality and training with great staff and he thanked me with another Irish Coffee on the house. I cant say enough about the staff here.c<br>       Let's go back to MY FAVORITE MEAL OF THE WEEK (check my reviews to see what this meal beat out). The corned beef hash had a very simple description: Housemade Corned beef Hash: poached eggs, Hollandaise. Let me tell you there was nothing simple about this dish. Lets work from the ground up. The hash was a pile of juicy shredded corned beef with grilled potato pieces throughout. The star of the hash was definitely the corned beef with just enough potato to make it hash. The two poached eggs were poached very precise; we take for granted sometimes how rare it is to get a perfectly poached egg. The Hollandaise sauce was deliciously delicate with a texture to die for and a flavor to raise you back to life. I ate this meal as slow as I could because I did not want to eat the last bite. <br>       I had such a great meal I felt guilty that my wife wasn't with me. I ordered a Poutine to go for her, heated it up for lunch a few days later and decided we need to go back to Chicago next weekend for brunch.

I work in the restaurant industry, and have years of food service (both cooking and serving) experience. There is a clear difference between a hard boiled egg and an overcooked one. Notwithstanding, a scotch egg should be cooked with a medium boiled egg. The server clearly did not know this, and was very dismissive. \"The egg has to be cooked hard boiled so that we can shape the sausage around it so that it sticks.\" Clearly you don't know how this works. <br><br>As far as other service notes go: He rang in the turkey club incorrectly, and we ended up with some spicy chicken sandwich (which was good, but incorrect).

I went with my mother, a concierge at the Marriott Marquis in South Loop, and we had a phenomenal experience from beginning to end. The staff was very warm and friendly towards us and our wonderful waiter, Manny, was eager to guide our decisions on what to order so that we could have the most memorable experience at The Gage. We started off with a tomato and kale salad topped with a fresh ball of mozzarella tossed in vinaigrette. Next came out our main courses which was the lobster roll for me and a spicy chicken sandwich for my mother which manny was considerate enough to accommodate her new diet by substituting the regular bun that comes with it for lettuce. It did not take away from her food at all which I had tried and it was so refreshing and tasty. Previously I had the lobster roll from The Gage but since then they have revamped the menu which is quite a regular occurrence here. Instead of it being served warm as it had been, it was served chilled with creme fresh which made it all the more enjoyable. My mother and I felt light and well nourished after eating at The Gage and there was nothing left to take home. The reason there is no picture attached of my mothers meal was because she was so eager to have it and started before I could get a picture. Before I conclude I want to mention that Manny was able to convince my mother, someone who has hated cheesecake all of her life, to order the cheesecake. It was so airy, fresh, and perfectly done I could not write this review without mention of it. Unfortunately, yesterday was the last day that it would appear on the menu because the strawberry season is coming to an end, and the contemporary chef at The Gage believes that it's time for something new to be added in its place in order to consistently have a vibrant menu at this establishment. The cheesecake was probably the best one both me and my mother have ever had and we have Manny to thank for persuading us to order it. Special thanks to Manny for the great experience, he truly is wonderful, and it is clear to see that he is a fresh face aspiring to become something great in restaurant management. It is obvious that he is immersing himself in the best way possible learning from some of the most well respected and successful restaurant owners such as Bill from the Gage.

Amazingly, the green beans were the fan favourite of the table - I forced everyone to try some because they were ridiculously good. Charred, spicy, with a punch of cured pork from the guanciale, and a hit of citrus from preserved lemon. They were really exceptional. My burger was also really good, but the temp was more medium than medium rare. However, it was juicy and well-seasoned with great toppings. I think I ate it all? It's a big burger, almost comically-so when you're going in for your first bite. I felt like a python trying to swallow a deer.<br><br>Everyone else was all-around satisfied with their meals, with a slight hiccup where a rockfish actually arrived as salmon, but the server was very apologetic and offered a replacement (not necessary, it was still delicious).

The Rose was very refreshing and in a decently sized glass. The oysters were in a broth/sauce that was very flavorful. It almost had an Indian/middle eastern type flavor. Perfect for dipping with the bread that accompanies it. The chicken was big enough to share between two people, it wasn't too dry or too moist.

If you have organic, grass-fed meats, THAT, dear restaurateur, is something that is well worth boasting about on your menu. Tell me about it! Don't make me raise an eyebrow at your servers in disbelief. Bottom line, I don't mind spending more on quality grass-fed, humanely raised meats and organic foods but I'm not convinced that this is the place to do so.<br><br>At The Gage, I didn't find much boasting over quality ingredients but I did find some savvy marketing on the menu. A roasted \"Amish\" chicken that has nothing to do with Amish or organic or even free-range farming? *eyebrow up* Thanks but no thanks. Grass-fed meats (according to our server although it was not written on the menu) from the butcher board? Sure...*eyebrow up* I'll take your word for it. I'm hungry and I have a train to catch.<br><br>Service was excellent. After asking so many questions about menu items, I had the nerve to ask our friendly server if it would take long. What a good sport. Our meals came out reasonably quickly and our server was both attentive and knowlegable. Easy 5 stars for service.<br><br>The food, however, wasn't as impressive as the service. There wasn't anything spectacular about the asparagus with poached egg. It's a rather large side and there is plenty to share between 2 people. It included a mix of green and white asparagus. The asparagus was well cooked, though maybe a tadpole (oops, foreshadowing), I mean a tad too much for my liking.<br><br>Now, about that egg...I love tails on puppy dogs and piglets but I don't love tails on poached eggs. And yet, there it was. A poached egg with a long tail. A big, fat tadpole on my asparagus. I'm thinking ungrateful thoughts about this damn polliwog and I'm suddenly reminded that I walked past a hungry man with a dying cat on the sidewalk. Am I selfish to want them to be the way my mother made poached eggs: always perfectly cooked in little round egg cups with compact whites and runny yolks? Never a runny white, especially not one with a stringy tail! Oh, Gage, why can't you treat that egg with the respect it deserves instead of cooking it into a baby frog costume? Why did you put a 2 star egg on my 3 star asparagus?<br><br>Anyway, the Colorado lamb chops were medium rare and deliciously seasoned. I was extremely grateful to see these perfectly cooked with a red center. Brah. Vo! They came with a Merguez sausage that was flavorful but dry and underwhelming. The mustard greens were perfectly cooked and well seasoned, and the garbanzo bean fritters were crisp and tasty. Overall, probably close to 4 stars. <br><br>My hubby's 8 oz bone-in prime filet steak was delicious although it wasn't the medium rare requested. It was more of a medium-well to well done. Well seasoned, but I really missed seeing that red center. I didn't even see pink. Also, this was a butcher board item. Again, although nothing on the menu indicated it, our server told us that this was grass-fed *eyebrow up*. At $38 for 8 oz, it should at least be perfectly cooked to order even if it ate cement for dinner.<br><br>The Caesar salad was generously sized and very tasty. I could have eaten this alone for my meal, especially after experiencing the polliwog. The anchovies were just as salty as an anchovy should be and the dressing was perfectly tangy. Delicious. High 4 stars.<br><br>Overall, probably close to 4 stars. There is plenty of room for improvement in the food, at least in several of the items we ordered.

Perhaps it was overhyped and I was expecting more. <br><br>Green beans: 3.75/5 They were delicious and topped with bacon but it was too salty.

The last Walnut attempt one month ago, was after a 3 hour wait! And was so long, I took a walk with my dad to Harold Washington Library(is there a very common short acronym for this place, btw? there must be one by now, and it's 2016....), the last time we were stuck in that line a month ago. The Gage was our savior then, and it also was on an earlier trip here in late 2014. I've finally gotten to the point where I think it's my fav place to eat on this part of Michigan Ave., since Bennigan's(yep a chain, but don't care. was always my former usual choice in this area, if not going to Miller's or Exchequer) shut down across from Art Institute not many years ago.<br><br>Their beer selection is decent, and has a very decent amount of craft/micro beer choices. Yeah the beer prices might not be the cheapest, but you're on Michigan Ave. and it also isn't a dive bar, so what did you expect? For what the Gage is, I think they're actually reasonable, if a tiny smidge expensive by a buck occasionally. I tried a quick sip of a friend's cocktail last visit, and it was what I expected it'd be. Not bad if a tad sweet, and tasted about how I'd expect a cocktail to be like. It was fine, and I've had much worse cocktails too. Myself, I'm more of a beer person!<br><br>Food has been decent for the most part here. Extremely few misses, and most everything I've tried has been decent. Fish and chips are pretty good here when I sampled a bite, but not quite up to how much I loved the ones at the former Edgewater Lounge(RIP). But are better here than at Elephant and Castle, believe it or not! All the people I ate with my last time there enjoyed their food though, and I greatly enjoyed what I ordered on their weekend brunch menu(Baked Pumpkin French Toast). Someone else at my table I believe ordered a burger, and liked it.<br><br>Bet you didn't know(unless you've eaten here before, it's mentioned on their menu and website, and company ads are on the stairs going down to their bathroom and private party room), that the name came from Gage Brothers & Co., which in the early 20th Century was located in this very building and space. They were a company that at least supplied(dunno if they made any women's hats themselves, but I wonder if they did?) women's dress hats, throughout the country. Anyway, you won't be disappointed if you go here, it's casual, and a comfortable place to eat for anyone. My personal preference is to eat here over Miller's Pub, too.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Went here late at night for drinks. We requested to be seated outside.

It came with a side of your choice so I had the roasted brussels sprouts with bacon and blue cheese. They were very different and excellent. I started with a beet salad which had a few differnet colors of beets and some star fruit in it. Again unique and very good. They also had some house made sodas which I tried all 3. One of them was a cola but it was clear. I never knew there was such a thing. Another was ginger beer with a pice of caramelized ginger floating in it which was a very unique taste.

However after about 40 minutes my tummy was growling and I could tell my wife was about to go full hangry.

As a whole it was very delicious, poached eggs are on point, so are sweet grilled tomato slices and sausage (House made Pork Merguez). The hollandaise sauce (Poblano Hollandaise) wasn't the best I've had, since it's not a typical egg and butter cream sauce, this taste deviates from that traditional recipe and feels strange, a good way but not buy-able way; I can enjoy it but I won't order it again.

The inside has that nice, dark bistro feel to it so I definitely prefer sitting outside especially when Chicago decides to cooperate with us.<br><br>Upon sitting down, our server approached us right away and offered us some of their huge beer selection which was nice. They also do provide bread and butter if you ask, it's more of a healthy multi-grain kind if that's your type.

They were delicious, definitely get these.

Next stop is this much talked about venison burger which is known as one of Chicago's best burgers. I must say I thought I would be disappointed because of all the hype, but I was pleasantly surprised. For $17 get the venison over their regular burger. The meat was perfection and not too chewy or dry, had tons of flavor that it almost didn't need all their extra ingredients but I can't say I didn't enjoy the caramelized onions, the gouda cheese, jalapeños on a warm brioche bun. We shared this as well and we chose their house made chips over the fries because I am most definitely a chip girl.<br><br>Here's where we didn't go 100%. I hated the dessert.

(Hopefully my girlfriend will like it?)<br><br>Instead, we were blown away. We split the seasonal yogurt and fruit (~$14). Huge cup of yogurt, granola, and more fruit than we could handle. It was more filling than you'd expect yogurt and fruit to be. Next, I ordered Chilaquiles ($13) while my dining partner ordered smoked salmon ($15). We were told that the smoked salmon would be a \"light\" portion (which is why I didn't order it), it ended up being a huge serving. She struggled to pile all of the smoked salmon onto the bagel, and that was after I helped myself to some of it. The Chilaquiles was, again, a massive portion. Never have I been so satisfied by a breakfast item featuring \"two eggs\".<br><br>Our server was exactly what you'd hope for when you get brunch: helpful but subdued.

Very accommodating as I have to be gluten free and dairy free, the servers and staff are always pleasant, and the food is wonderful! This isn't the place to go if you're on a budget. If you're willing to splurge, though, I don't think you'll be disappointed!<br><br>The drink menu is unique with a ton of selection. They even had special drinks they did just for Lollapalooza and were very welcoming even though we weren't dressed up. I would say the atmosphere is a bit on the classier side, so shorts and sneakers didn't really 'fit in' but we were not treated one bit different for it. The food menu had a number of options for everyone in our group, including me. Our server both times (for an early dinner and brunch, different servers) were more than happy to go over menu options that were safe for me and even checked with the chef to make sure that what I was ordering was, in fact, gluten free. They even included a note to the kitchen without me having to ask for it. Definitely a great place if you have any kind of food allergies or issues because they are incredibly accommodating. This alone is worth 5 stars for me personally, but the food!! Oh man, even if I didn't have to be gluten and dairy free, I would be coming here for the food. House made sausages (YUM!), curry gravy for dipping fries in, lobster roll... all in all, really good menu that you can tell they put time, effort, and love into.<br><br>The only thing that detracted for me was that early dinner Thursday, the patio overhang was leaking pretty badly when it was raining out and left both of my dining companions a bit wet due to the splashing as water came through the (poorly constructed) patio roof. This wasn't really a big deal given we'd been at Lollapalooza part of the morning, but it did detract from the experience. They did offer to move us to another outdoor table, however those were getting wet as well and the indoor tables were full with a wait.

I was told the Trout as well as the venison were pretty good. We got the mussels as well. The mussels came with a vindaloo curry that was mediocre at best. I've had better curry mussels for a much cheaper price (was $18). The main course came next. It's rare that I say this about most plates at restaurants, but the trout was under seasoned and worst of all, completely bland and devoid of any flavor. There were too many things going on with the dish and none of it helped make the dish anything more than meh! And for $28 I find that unacceptable. The venison burger by contrast was actually pretty good and def worth getting. Although still too expensive at $19, it was not regrettable. Unfortunately the food was not the only complaint. <br>Our server made some questionable remarks like \"the fish and chips are low brow compared to the trout\" (huh? How does that help me determine what tastes better?!) And worst of all, through the entire meal, he never bothered to come over and ask us how the food was?! If he had I would have told him early on how the trout was sub par, but since he didn't come till the end to drop off the bill, I had to tell him at the end. He did do a last minute hail mary by taking the trout off the bill, but by that point I had a totally forgettable experience and wanted to get out there ASAP. <br>The 3 stars are for the ambiance of the restaurant, the venison burger and the server's attempt at salvaging the experience.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "A girlfriend insisted that I couldn't leave Chicago without coming here.

I'll share a little about each. <br><br>Sunday lunch: I had just completed the Chicago triathlon and suffice it to say that I was very hungry. Energy bars and a banana were just not doing it for me. I needed real sustenance! Three of us arrived at The Gage and we were seated right away. The service was seriously on point. Everyone went out of their way to take care of us and treated is with the utmost respect even though I was wearing a triathlon tshirt and I had a huge black racing number tattoo going down the side of one arm with a black sharpie marker wave number on the other. Our waiter was actually interested in what I had competed in and asked me about it. I ordered a mushroom sandwich with fries. It was really delicious. The fries were so good that when a homeless person saw me walking outside with the leftovers and asked me for them, I said no because they were so good that I needed to covet them. My friend didn't like her cold soup (it was supposed to be prepared as such), so our lovely server brought her out a new bowl of something different. He also left the cold soup in case someone else wanted to eat it, which was cool. This was an awesome experience!<br><br>Weekday drinks/dessert: There weren't many seats available without a reservation, which surprised me because it was almost 8 PM on a weeknight, but they seated us at a table near the door and brought another chair. The three of us each ordered a drink. I went with the hot cider because it was cold outside. My drink was good, but my friend's hot Irish coffee was better. Our service was really great the whole meal. We had trouble flagging down our server at one point and the hostess graciously came over and bright my friend's old fashioned to the bar because it was too strong for her. Once the bartender added some sprite, she said it was much better. Our dessert (pot de creme) was good, but I wasn't blown away. It couldn't compare to the pot de creme from Autre Monde (this is my official plug for it if you haven't been there). The candied cashews didn't seem to gel with the dish. Also, the serving size was pretty small and a little pricey. Of course, this is all to be expected at a \"$$$\" establishment. <br><br>Overall, I had two great experiences here.

I sent the mess back and reiterated my order. What came out was the reverse- almost burnt fries and barely cooked fish from which you could pour out the oil. I sent that back too and substituted the bison burger which was very well done and paired with perfect fries.

She stuck me in the back corner right next to the kitchen, as if this was a fun experience. Before she asked me if this was OK, she walked away. Then a man who came over to pour my water asked me if I was OK. I told him I wasn't interested in sitting here and I wanted to be more by the bar, upfront with all of the liveliness. I know beggars can't be choosers because I didn't have a reservation, but I did see a lot of empty tables up front. He said OK, walked away and never came back. Finally someone else came over and told me he could help me. The hostess came back over and resat me where I wanted to be seated. After that experience, I had a bad taste in my mouth, figuratively of course. Once my server came over it calmed me down as she was amazing. Beautiful girl, great service, and totally understood what I meant when I said I'm craving salmon/something light (so girly-I know). She recommended something delicious. When my colleague got there, we ordered martinis, ate, laughed, and it was a great experience. This could be a great place for any occasion. There was a date sitting right next to me and I family on the other side. Only thing is, the seating is very close so a lot like New York.

We got the special poutine to share, and it was soooo good. My friend got the eggs benedict I believe, which was tasty but also had a side of baked sliced potatoes with brie. Yum!!

My other friend got the lobster roll, which I didn't try, but she really liked it.

Arrived at Gage, seemed nice and pleasant. Ambiance was nice, felt like we went back in time and were at an old mysterious train station, was kind of cool... dimmed lighting, booth seats, etc. <br><br>Checked out Yelp while trying to decide what to order, lots of people said the fish and chips were great, and there were a number of people ordering the burger (I'd say this was probably the least expensive thing on their limited menu of entrees). We asked the server what were some of the popular things to order, and he said the Elk was definitely a must-try (~$50) and he also mentioned that he could'n't understand why people would come here and order their fish and chips (which they were out of) and the burger. But maybe, people order those because they sound safe, and if I were ever made to come back here again, I'd probably rather go with those than any of the other fancy, more expensive dishes on the menu like the duck, elk, and mussels. Anyways, from the start, I found our server to be snobby and condescending, so that was a no no. Second, my sister and I noticed another table with the same number of people, was seated after us, ordered after us (with the same server), got their drinks, basket of bread (which our table never received), and got their food 30 minutes earlier than us. That table actually finished eating and was gone before our table even got our food. Ridiculous.<br><br>When our food finally arrived...a hour later, my un-biased opinion about everything: <br>- Duck poutine; was amazing, super delicious, would recommend everyone getting this <br>- Mussells; friends said they had had better, would not order again <br>- Burger; a friend said it was good, but he doesn't have taste buds, so he wouldn't know the difference from in n out and mc donalds. I tried a bite of the burger and it was very much whatever... Why do places even offer things like this on their menu when it's going to taste so not special; better off without this completely. <br>- Duck entree; the sauce and oil really looked like it had been sitting for awhile (see my photo for reference...so gross), not being biased at all, but this was something that I definitely noticed the moment I got my plate; the duck meat was very soft which was weird to me, and the taste was just ok, nothing special at all and would not recommend this to anyone. <br>- Elk; this was a major disappointment. We were anticipating this to be really yummy but instead it was a very dried square of meat with nothing else. lol wow.... please don't order this. <br><br>And pretty much, this was our experience. Left quite a bad taste and feeling in our mouths... except for those poutine fries. lols.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/m9dn1h-YLqbUfBljTzv2gQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Duck poutine was the best thing there (would go just for those, and not for anything else!)"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wzdxXBn3T2KlYCxrLmQ7yA/168s.jpg", "caption": "The duck... waited over an hour for this and it looked like it had been sitting for awhile (note the oil separating from the sauce)"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Dropped by for lunch and ordered the salmon tataki.

The hostess was nice enough to seat me right away before my friend came since she said those tables went quickly.

I'm actually not a huge beer drinker, so we asked our waitress what she recommended and went with the Good Juju, which is a pale ale with ginger added. It turned out to be the perfect refreshing beer for the meal and I especially loved the ginger taste which wasn't too overpowering.<br><br>It was a bit harder to decide on food since everything on the menu looked delicious. We ended up ordering the \"PBR\" battered fried pickles, scotch egg, the \"crispy, sticky, smoky lamb ribs\", and an order of the fish and chips.

The food here is delicious and absolutely worth the trip to if you are just coming to dine only. The alcohol selection -- beer, wine, or even mixed drinks -- is massive and definitely will quench your thirst. <br><br>This place gets crowded especially during dinner hours, so I'm glad that I had some friends waiting at the bar for me when I arrived around 10 PM on a Thursday night.<br><br>Between the three of us, we ordered and shared these appetizers:<br>Seared Ora King Salmon, Loaded Shishito #Peppers, Scotch Egg, and California Burrata. Everything was delicious. I wouldn't go as far as to say any of these were mind blowing though, but definitely yummy eats. Everything except for the scotch egg was easy to share. The scotch egg seemed to be a little bit overcooked. (I always find the ones that are a little bit runny inside to be the most interesting.) <br><br>I ended up having the Venison Burger for my main entree. Very juicy, very flavorful throughout the burger. Very happy with the burger, although if I could change anything to the plate, I would be looking for some sort of contrast. The juices of the venison left the burger to be on the savory/saltier end of the spectrum.<br><br>Still, everything was top notch. I would definitely recommend The Gage for your gastropub stop!

The Gage doesn't look very large from the foyer; however, the journey to our table revealed a few connected rooms, all crammed to the max with tables and chairs. The decor is rich, dark, and manly - a space you'd expect to see classy 1920 mobster kings smoking cigars.<br><br>Our experience at The Gage was all about indulgence. We were greeted first by the chef, who discussed their Check Please appearance and also made recommendations of his favorite dishes. We took him very seriously and ordered them all. That made the job of  Augustus (our server) pretty simple; however, he still shone with poise and kind attention to our every chance eye-contact. In fact, when we asked for more dipping bread for our mussels, we were presented with four more large pieces - far more than we wanted. Augustus accidentally treated us to an extra cocktail for \"the table\" and did not charge us. See? Indulgence.<br><br>In all, we ordered the following:<br><br>Basil Escargot - Not your typical escargot. The Gage took those little snails out of their buttery homes and sandwiched them between hazelnut cookies with goat cheese for a dish that completely reconstructed my understanding of escargot. It was a little difficult to share (see my picture) as cutting the presentation in two caused an unsightly mess on the plate.<br><br>Mussels - M loved them. She said that she caught hints of salty sea water in the savory little bits. I liked the soft texture of the meats and the broth. For the price and quality, we got a HUGE portion. The two of us could not finish all of them.<br><br>Crisp Rabbit Salad - This was our mutual favorite dish of the evening. It was simple arugula with a light mustard dressing over a bed of shredded rabbit. The greens were topped with crisp, pure white, puffed rice pearls that added a perfect amount of delicate crunch to the salad. We had the chef divide the salad onto two plates for us, which ended up being perfect portions.<br><br>Maple Leaf Farms Duck Roasted Breast and Confit - This was a surprising comfort-food dish. The clove flavor shone through the pudding and lent a nice spiciness to the richness of the duck. There were actually two types of duck meat: breast and leg. The breast was served in seven thick slices on top and the leg was shredded underneath. M thought that the shredded meat was rabbit at first (after enjoying the Crisp Rabbit Salad), but Augustus kindly explained that it was all duck. I must say that we were both distended by the time we got to this final dish and did not have the hunger to properly enjoy it.<br><br>We also had wine, the Old Fashioned no. 24, and Irish Coffee. The Old Fashioned no. 24 tasted watery from the generous pour of ginger ale but was still good. I liked the dried cherries at the bottom. The Irish Coffee wasn't sweet enough for me, but I enjoyed the presentation of a thick layer of cream on top of dark coffee. When drinking it, the cream bumped my lip and mixed with the hot coffee on it's path to my mouth.<br><br>Our entire bill came to about $130 (if I remember correctly). M commented that it wasn't nearly as expensive as she expected it to be, especially considering all of our alcohol. We think our sharing all of our dishes had a lot to do with the final price.<br><br>The single most reason why neither Melinda nor I would give a full five stars to The Gage is because it was so incredibly crowded. We were there at 5:00 PM and the place became completely full soon afterward. Other tables were very close to us and the physical space was difficult to navigate when entering or exiting or table (when using the loo for example).

We got the soup of the day and it was quite bland and had a floury taste. I had to add salt and pepper to get any real depth of taste we were hungry so we finished it but no bread was offered and the lamb sausage in the lentil soup was 3 very thin slices of lamb sausage in the bottom of the dish which a small cup of soup was poured over. Moving on to the Amish chicken and this faired no better. It was advertised with asparagus but there was no sign of it on the plate. My waiter informed me it was added into the tobuleh but I couldn't see it even in garnish form. There was way too much feta that had been mixed into the tobuleh so it lost its usual flavored and tasted only of the feta and the mix was not a pleasant one. This dish I didn't even attempt to finish. To Gage's credit this was not put on our bill once I was asked if I hadn't liked it and said I hadn't. My husband got the lamb shank and it was more like a mutton shank than lamb. His comment was I don't mind mutton it's more like goat but it didn't taste like lamb.

My dad and I flew into O'Hare on a Friday evening, and needed some late night food after a long day of traveling. I checked out what was relatively close to our hotel, and The Gage showed up. Looked promising according to the Yelp iPhone app, so we decided to give it a try.<br><br>The Gage is located right next to Millennium Park - perfect location. We arrived around 10pm and the place was hoppin'. The inside felt very bar-like and was super loud and packed on a Friday night. We asked if we could sit outside and it made our experience much more enjoyable. Much more quiet and peaceful and was basically 100% different from if we had sat inside, which I was very thankful for!<br><br>As far as food goes, my dad started off with the oysters appetizer: Pink Trout Roe, and Ponzu Mignonette. I had never tried an oyster before so he persuaded me to try one of the smaller ones (3 small, 3 large). It was...interesting. I'm not a fishy person to begin with. My exact words were, \"It wasn't as bad as I was expecting...but not good either.\" LOL. My dad thought they were pretty good and he especially liked the smaller ones. <br><br>For entrees, I got the Pork Porterhouse with chestnuts, sweet potato, grilled apple, and natural jus. I thought that it was decent, but I felt that my pork was a little on the dry side. I enjoyed the sweet potato but I still think you could probably order a side dish to make it a more filling meal. My dad ordered the Roasted Rack Of Elk, which came with a giardiniera salad, prosciutto, and black truffle croquettas. It was his first time trying elk and he REALLY enjoyed it - probably his favorite meal out of our entire stay in Chicago. It wasn't as game-y as he thought it would be and it was very soft and delicious.<br><br>Dessert was by FAR my favorite part of the evening. GET THE CORN AND BLUEBERRIES. You will not be disappointed! I was about to go for the Chocolate Pot de Creme when I realized, \"I could get this anywhere.\" Our waiter, Seth, said the Corn and Blueberries was popular because corn is a very Midwestern ingredient, and since I'm from California it probably doesn't play as prevalent of a role in my life as it does in the Midwest. I decided to go for it, and I think it may be one of the best desserts I've ever had, or at least one the most unique! Corn and Blueberries is described on the menu as \"tarragon blueberry compote, corn ice cream, gooey butter cake, and crispy corn crepes ($10)\". OMG. The corn ice cream was the best part. It has that irresistible sweet corn flavor that made each bite a slice of heaven. omg...I could have eaten like a pint of that alone! I also really liked the gooey butter cake. It was really decadent and so buttery without being overly sweet. Absolutely perfect, and paired well with the blueberries. Ugh. I would come back just for dessert. I'm sad I live in California and won't be able to get it!<br><br>Service was absolutely fantastic. Seth, our waiter, was super awesome. My dad told him about how I'm a Yelp Elite LOL and Seth told us about a bunch of restaurants he suggested for us to go to. I was pleased to find out that many of the places he recommended were ones my fellow Yelp Elite friends had referred to me! He was totally aware of the foodie scene in Chicago and it was awesome and he gave us so many good tips and comments.

While getting them for us, the bar manager came to the table to introduce himself to us and congratulate us on our recent nuptials (something that isn't often done in the dining industry anymore).

The sandwich is embellished with ribbons of sauerkraut, melted cheddar cheese, and alkaline giardiniea. Each section is liberally painted with streaks of freshly blended red pepper aioli and tart yellow mustard aioli. Sweet, crisp leaves of bibb lettuce neutralize the saltiness of the sandwich simultaneously enhancing it with a delightful crunch.

His light-hearted banter set the tone of our night, breaking the ice for everyone and allowing us to really open up and make the most of the occasion.

It was evident that he took great pride in his work and he wanted to ensure the best experience possible for his guests. As someone with severe food allergies, it was comforting to know that I was in good hands. Some servers give off a vibe that makes you question whether they actually checked with the chef or just walked out of view to play Candy Crush. I have never had someone take so much interest in my menu choices and doubt that I will experience that kind of service again.<br><br>To top it off, the food was excellent.

I was absolutely blown away by their 3-course Restaurant Week menu. Where many restaurants simply take the event for granted and some actually seem to increase their prices to take advantage of unsuspecting diners, The Gage has simply done the opposite. <br><br>The $22 lunch menu was superb. I started with a celery root puree served with a light, bite sized biscuit, horseradish gougere, and garnished with pork confit. First off, the serving was surprisingly large. I expected a cup of soup, they served me a large bowl. Often restaurants will prepare this type of soup too densely and attempt to thicken the base with cream, not so here it was a beautifully light with a texture that reminded you of the fresh coarseness of celery. A superb start to our meal.<br><br>I ordered the whitefish for my entree. The whitefish was pan fried with the skin left on and lightly seasoned with sea salt.  The fish was served with rye gnocchi, on a bed of whole leave spinach and topped with seaweed with smoked onion cream sauce and garnished with pousse-pied (sea green bean seaweed). I don't think anyone is capable of doing whitefish better, the fish was incredibly fresh and cooked perfectly; tender, but retaining the firmness of the filet. The gnocchi was homemade with a soft texture and added a welcome contrast to the dish. The pousse-pied on top was just a spectacular and creative touch that added a salty, crunchy dimension that, combined with the oils in the crispy fish skin, created a beautiful juxtaposition reminiscent of fine dining, not a urban gastropub. And did I mention this meal was only $22?<br><br>We finished the meal off with panettone crips with anise caramel sauce and what tasted like cream cheese ice cream. The dessert was simply delicous the panettone crips were displayed a nutty and moderately dense texture and were complimented well with the more caramel than anise sauce. The ice cream was dense with a smooth, richness that lingered after each panettone bite. For lack of a better term, this dessert was like eating cake and ice cream on steroids!<br><br>On top of that the service was flawless, and we were in and out in a perfect amount of time for a work lunch. <br><br>Overall, I thought there wasn't a single thing that they could have done better.

Fries with curry sauce are also a must try golden crispy fries served with a big bowl of brown curry sauce for dipping.  The fried pickle chips where just ok pickles where to thin and I have had numerous better even here in the city. The burrata I would not order again the gazpacho has a odd smokey flavor and the burrata is not creamy and flavorful like burrata should be plus the cheese is served to cold which masks the flavor it did have. Lastly we had the fish and chips, the waiter had the kitchen split it for the two of us and it came out looking like 2 whole orders, great bang for the buck and equally great service. Each plate was served with 2 pieces of fish a healthy order of fries and all the dipping sauces and coleslaw. Some of the fish was served a little soggy not as crispy as good fried fish crust should be but the flavor was still good.

We got in, sat ourselves at the bar, and were able to order and get some drinks quickly. <br><br>I liked the setup of the bar area, because not only were the stools by the bar up for grabs, but you could seat yourself at any of the bar tables, too. The cocktail menu is pretty small (I think 10 drinks tops). There are a few beers, too, but not as many to choose from as most bars. The wine list is extensive, and so are the scotch and whiskey lists. My mom ended up with a blood orange soda--tasty as well as pretty. Since we decided on curry fries for an appetizer, I felt I had to go with a Guinness. It was a good pour and a good price ($6) so I was happy.<br><br>The curry fries came in a HUGE bowl. Really, this was a massive serving of fries, and the curry sauce came on the side. My mom and I decided to dip the fries into the sauce, but I think it would have been better if we had poured it over the top of the fries because I wasn't getting as much curry flavor as I would like and as I've had at other bars I've ordered this at.<br><br>After the fries, my mom feasted on a mushroom and greens warm sandwich with the chicken orzo soup and I got the buffalo chicken sandwich. These were so good. I got all the buffalo flavor I wanted from my sandwich and my mom's would be a meal I'd order on a day I wanted something light, but also comforting. These were slam dunks and I ate past the point when I should have stopped because I wanted to be able to fit it all!<br><br>At the end of the meal, the bill didn't end up being as expensive as I anticipated. The restaurant is probably more expensive for dinner than lunch but I spent no more money here on lunch than I would at, say, DMK (to give an idea, the buffalo chicken sandwich which comes with chips cost $12--at DMK I would get a burger and add on fries for the same price).

I have to say, this chicken is excellent.  The description includes the magic words: \"goat cheese\" and word to the wise, it's melted and so yummy.  I know people who wouldn't order chicken because they eat it at home often, but this is worth eating anywhere.  <br><br>This time we also ordered the Brussels sprouts, which are a favorite - yes, children - of my husband's and mine.  Luckily these could be ordered with the bacon on the side, if you, like me, don't believe in bacon.  The brie was inoffensive to both of us and while good, isn't a necessity.   <br>   <br>Otherwise, I've also enjoyed the chips (fries), bread with sea salt butter, and to my surprise, the fried pickles.  I tend not to dabble in pickles, but as an American, I will try things when fried that I will not try when au natural.  In small doses, and with some lingering hesitation, I do hereby endorse these pickles as edible.   <br> <br>Pre-dinner I had a delicious blood orange green tea at the bar, and post-dinner I shared the chocolate pudding cake with Nutella and ice cream.  Both were extra-credit versions of things you've had before.  For whatever reason, I haven't done much drinking at The Gage but I will rectify that next time since their wine and spirits are a vast but carefully curated collection.   <br><br>The service is always gracious, both at the bar and tableside.  The staff is polished but unpretentious, and I've seen the owner check in on tables more than once.  I like the decor choices but I will say the booths near the bar can be a little dim - do with that what you will, you romantics.  The framed old adverts lining the walls in the stairway are cute and add a little uniqueness.   <br><br>The Gage is on our short list for downtown destinations.  It has fit the bill for special occasions, drop-ins and a post-theater dinner twice.  I hereby endorse The Gage with no hesitation whatsoever.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "For a spot in the loop, it's surprisingly good.  They have an above average drink selection and the food is above average as well.  It's conveniently located on Mich Ave, and is a great starting point for a night out, especially if you are entertaining guests from out of town etc.  Get the Mussels, a scotch, a bourbon, a beer and enjoy.  They have a great private event space downstairs if you're into that.  <br>Cheers!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Stopped in here after a run for brunch on a Saturday, has some nice shaded outdoor seating. <br><br>First, decor and setting was nice.

If you are going to say you can accommodate the needs of your paying customers, you need to do just that.  Also you might want to train your staff on showing more REAL compassion for those of us with medical conditions, and not make a joke of it.  There are plenty of other restaurants in Chicago that go above and beyond, and you will lose a lot of business for this type of inconsistency.  I know I will not be returning.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "We loved, loved, loved everything about The Gage.

The manager, Sheena, was as nice and understanding as one can be. She told us that because the Restaurant Week website had made the mistake, she would honor the $22 price, and we could order anything we wanted off the menu (they were serving from the brunch menu on that day). Our server, Amanda, was very sweet and extremely attentive. She made some excellent recommendations. We started with the zucchini raisin bread. It was sweet but not overly sweet, and served with a cinnamon butter, which gave it an extra aromatic flavor. The serving was more than ample (we took half of it home). I ordered the Crab Louie Sandwich, which had large pieces of blue lump crab, and was delicious. They were even accommodating enough to leave out the celery (not a celery fan). Also, instead of the celery-apple slaw that was served with it, Amanda suggested several other sides. I ordered the Gage Potatoes, potatoes served with melted Brie cheese (scrumptious). My friend has the Traditional Creole Gumbo, which wasn't overly spicy but spicy enough to be considered \"traditional.\" Amanda offered us dessert, but we were too full to order any. Then when our bill arrived, we were surprised to discover they didn't even charge the entire $22 each. A restaurant is more than just a good meal; the employees make it a delightful experience.  Both Sheena and Amanda turned what could have been a disappointment into an amazing experience for both of us.

The sausage had a nice kick to it and the duck had a great jus but other than that I wasn't impressed. <br><br>Our waitress was very nice, she gave us plenty of time to think things through, we were taking forever (first date and all).

I want to eat this salad every single day! Further, we shared a burger. It was a smidge overcooked--we asked for med rare but got medium--but it was very good.

The menu wasn't tremendously appealing to me, but I saw a few things that caught my eye. Looking for a late-night meal with very few options available, we decided to give it a try. <br><br>A slight annoyance...I checked their hours online and found a heap of conflicting information. One closing time from Yelp, another from Google, another from their own website. I would generally trust the hours on the restaurant's own website, but the current time was right at their listed closing time. In hopes that perhaps one of the other sources were accurate, I called and found out that none of the sites listing a closing time were correct. Thankfully, that meant we were still able to hop a couple of blocks over for a meal.<br><br>I worried that we were slightly underdressed (jeans, untucked button-up shirt), but quickly found out that the full spectrum of clientele was being served. Some were in suits and sports coats, others in mangled t-shirts and skinny jeans. We were seated in the main dining area where we might as well have joined another party. The tables were so close together that you could hardly squeeze into the booth side without getting pretty fresh with the folks beside you. The ambience was that of a typical dark, loud, upscale bar in the city. The folks beside us were talking about their Am-Ex Black cards...how exciting! *rolls eyes*<br><br>From the draft beer menu, I ordered a Blue Moon to drink, but was disappointed a few minutes later when the waitress came back and said they didn't have it. No biggie, I wasn't really feeling like trying something new, so I decided to stick to water. I ordered the Fish and Chips and hubs, who was only in the mood for dessert, ordered the chocolate mousse. The waitress was decent but had a difficult personality to read. It sometimes came across as pretentious, sometimes personable, mostly awkward and sometimes bothered. I'll take the blame and chalk it up to me not feeling super comfortable in with the rich, hipster crowd.<br><br>My fish and chips came rather quickly (about 10 minutes) in a cute presentation with the fish wrapped in a newspaper cone. The fries were quite good, but the fish wasn't anything spectacular. The fish was moist and flaky and the batter was crispy, but had little flavor. Oddly enough, the cold dessert that hubs ordered at the same time as my entree took considerably longer to come out than my hot entree...they volunteered that the fish and dessert were prepared at different stations (I'd hope so) when they brought the fish out. When it did come out, the chocolate mousse looked great and was served in a mason jar with cookie crumbs layered throughout. Unfortunately, the mousse was very flat and had the consistency of a dense pudding rather than a light and airy mousse. The flavor was that of a brownie batter....you know, when you lick the mixer blades. The ratio of cookie crumbs to mousse was unbalanced, resulting in a very dry dessert.<br><br>Thankfully, the tables around us started to clear out and we could enjoy a normal conversation. The waitress was very kind to not charge the Am-Ex Black folks beside us for their desserts, making sure they were aware of it before they left their tip. While certainly none of our business, it's hard to ignore in such close proximity...I'm sure they appreciated the favor. When our check came, they tried to charge me for my beer that they did not have. I mentioned it when she took my card and it was removed from the check (no biggie). We quickly shuffled out and made our way back to the hotel. We love the Palmer House and will always stay there, however we will most likely not be returning to The Gage during our future visits.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Fantastic brunch.

The Gage is the only place I know thus far that provides hazelnut carrots in Chicago, besides Henri, which is its sister restaurant. <br><br>However, most of the food in the Gage is too salty. According to my friends, the steak is over-marinated and the soup has been added too much salt.

Near the top of her list was The Gage. After spending the day at the Shedd, my friend and I figured we'd drop by The Gage for dinner before catching the Metra back to the suburbs.<br><br>We were not disappointed. I suspected we'd be in good hands when we sat down and our server reminded us that the chef was a recent regional James Beard award nominee. <br><br>We started with an order of the duck fat nuts and the famous Scotch egg. <br><br>The nuts weren't anything too special. I guess I had hoped the duck fat would give them a richer flavor, but it was too subtle to really justify the price tag. I'd probably skip these next time.<br><br>But that Scotch egg was great. The breading outside was light and crispy, and one cut in with my knife revealed the crumbly yolk. The combination of the sausage and the egg was like brunch for dinner. And the accompanying whole-grain mustard was a nice touch. <br><br>Next, we tried the basil escargot. The snails were lightly fried with basil, giving them a light crispness and unique flavor that paired nicely with the natural earthiness of escargot and the goat cheese fonduta underneath. But the real star of the dish was the light crunch of the hazelnut crisp on top. It gave the savory dish just a hint of sweetness and a unique texture pairing.<br><br>We also tried the seared scallops. These were cooked perfectly--that beautiful touch of caramelization on the outside and tender meat inside. The accompanying apple and watercress salad was nice, especially when I got a bite with the beet purée. The touch of horseradish was unexpected, but really brought all the flavors together.<br><br>My friend and I split the special risotto of the day--a vegetarian mix with rapini and cheese. I think we should probably have stuck with appetizers--the risotto felt a little too safe and expected after eating such unique flavor combinations in our appetizers. Plus, the rice was a little undercooked for my tastes. <br><br>After such delicious savory food, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try dessert, even though I was admittedly already a little stuffed. <br><br>We ordered the chocolate ganache and caramel tartlet and the gingered beignets. <br><br>The chocolate tartlet wasn't anything too special--your basic chocolate tart with sweet caramel crumbles on top--but the accompanying toasted milk ice cream was delicious! It was so rich and creamy, with such simple, yet sophisticated, flavor.<br><br>The gingered beignets were easily my favorite bite of the entire dinner. The dough was light and gently fried. The ginger ice cream and peach jam made for a great pairing, just the right touch of spice and heat.<br><br>Service was attentive, even with a full house. Water glasses were promptly refilled and our server was ready and eager to answer any questions we had about the menu. It's always nice to see restaurants hold on to that humble charm after they've gotten James Beard recognition.<br><br>With a creative--yet classic--menu that not only looks good but tastes good too, I'll definitely be back to The Gage the next time I'm in Chicago.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Great atmosphere and service!

I'd never been there myself but was pleased with the choice. <br><br>Right within reach of the Art Institute, Millennium Park and other attractions in the Loop, the Gage occupies prime real estate on Michigan Avenue. Inside was dim, with glassed-in, separate rooms to make for quieter dining (although one diner in ours felt the need to talk at top volume). <br><br>Our server, Zachary, was young but polished (though he initially startled me by lighting the tea candle for our table right in the corner of my peripheral vision) and did a fine job accomodating us and the other tables in the area with grace and balance. <br><br>May I mention the food! The Gage has a whiff of the gastropub about it but isn't pretentious about the food (in other words, it doesn't arrive as a deconstruction or a tower, blasted with CO2 or in miniscule portion). <br><br>I ordered the red wine roasted Amish chicken with cream-braised salsify (a root vegetable similar to parsnips), which was delicious, though the chicken came with some unnecessary, undressed baby greens on top that were either an overgrown garnish or an unfinished salad.  The chicken was moist and flavorful, and the salsify a surprise hit, tender and decadent with the cream. <br><br>My friend had fish and chips, of which I had a bite: serviceable, not soggy, though with all the other wonderful-looking things to choose from on this menu this wouldn't have been my personal first pick.<br><br>The one issue we had with dinner was the plates. Both of our meals came in oddly-shaped plates that were hard to cut in/on. Mine was an oval ramekin, several inches deep, which held the chicken and salsify; cutting down into this, especially maneuvers like slicing chicken off the bone, was awkward in this setup. My friend had a shallow rectangular dish for her fish and chips, but it had a lip that she kept hitting as she cut, which was difficult not to bump and made for slow going.<br><br>For dessert we selected orange creme brulee; its sugar surface was perhaps just slightly undercaramelized (you didn't quite get the crisp crack but rather a bit of a bend to the spoon tip), but the intense orange scent and flavor were intoxicating. <br><br>From the cocktail menu, I sampled the Gage Old Fashioned, which contained candied ginger and (oddly) nuts -- like, whole almonds floating in the glass. The ginger flavor intensified as I got to the bottom of the glass. Intriguing.<br><br>The Gage was a good find for downtown dining.

On seconds: I was quickly disillusioned with their Smoked Haddock Cake and Peekytoe Crab. The breading was half salt, while the afterthought of lemon crème fraiche and caviar weren't the best.

In fact it was one of the best casual meals we've ever had.  We started by ordering the poutine for our table since our kids love French fries and they devoured them. My husband said that the venison burger was probably the best burger he'd ever had, and the man loves burgers so you can be sure he's had many a variety. I had the Moroccan chicken sandwich and needed but to close my eyes to take me straight to Morocco. The flavor profile was delicious and spot on. It also came with a cup of chicken soup with orzo and English peas which was to die for. The peas, my oh my, amplified the dish to an insanely fresh level. I need to find a way to recreate this soup.<br><br>We decided to order because after everything else had blown our minds we'd be stupid not to. We ordered a nectarine tart (it wasn't technically a tart, but close enough) with a honey lavender ice cream. Perfection. The ice cream was a home run. I am picky with ice creams, having discovered Smitten in San Francisco. This was at the same level. We also had a creme brulee.

The actual burger itself was tasty although it was more medium rare than medium (I chalk that up to a lazy or inexperienced chef). But the Camembert cheese is so mild that it really just lends a cheesy texture to the burger. The onion and orange marmalade kind of cancel out one another so that the whole combination is just pointless. AND, the iceberg lettuce and warm, mushy olives served with it were almost offensive. The fries were also bland. Everything was bland, bland, bland. I could, however, taste the tomato, raw onion, pickle and ketchup. Thank God for small favors. <br><br>That's another thing. I feel for the dishwasher because everything came in its own separate dish. <br><br>Pssst, Gage! Just because you put the fries in one dish, the ketchup in another and then put it all on a plate doesn't make it fancy.

We'd never eaten there before, but it has excellent reviews on Yelp, and a few of my friends highly recommended it. It was soooooo delicious.<br><br>We were seated in the back next to the kitchen, so we got to witness all of the excitement of the restaurant firsthand. A couple at the table next to us were celebrating a birthday with a tasting menu prepared by Dirk Flanigan, the executive chef.<br><br>We told our waiter, who was extremely eccentric (in a good way), that it was our anniversary. He promptly brought us out some delicious prosecco (my new favorite)!<br><br>We started with the amazing scallops, which were served with melted onions, orange segments, crispy chicken skin, and a house-made olive tapenade. The chicken skin added an earthy, savory note to the dish, while the orange segments provided the needed acid and freshness to the dish.<br><br>Following the scallops, which I am totally craving right at this moment, I ordered the duck leg confit and roasted breast, while Josh ordered the fish and chips (which were flying out of the kitchen left and right).<br><br>My duck came with roasted endive, wilted grapes and a natural jus. Unbelievable. This was my first time eating a duck, and it won't be the last! The confit leg was just encredible, I don't have words to describe it, but I'll try: earthy, crispy, moist, deep (does that make sense?), tender, succulent.....I loved every bite.<br><br>The roasted breast was also quite delicious, cooked perfectly (so I'm told), and provided a much-needed contrast to the confit leg. The combination of the grapes, which were sweet, with the endive, which was quite bitter, was awesome. And if you succeeded to get a bit of everything into one bite, it was utter bliss.<br><br>Mr. Flanigan himself asked me how I was enjoying the duck (quite a bit!) and explained to me the balance of the grapes with the endive. It was great to get such personal service - especially at a restaurant that we'd never been to before.

The batter was appropriately light and crispy, but you could still taste the Guinness. The chips, which seemed to be twice-fried, could have satisfied me as a meal on their own! And even the tartar sauce was unique and delicious. Super good. I'd definitely recommend you try the fish & chips at The Gage.<br><br>Then we had an amazing desert, which was a play on french toast and espresso. I don't remember the details, sadly, but I do remember it was delicious, and I would totally get it again. Yum!<br><br>At long last we were finished, and it was time to go.

If you are considering this as a brunch spot, I'm not as big of a fan. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't PHENOM brunch that warrants a 5th star, I wanted more from a brunch menu and for the price of brunch it needed to be phenom. Anyway, So I say: make this your loop dinner spot. <br><br>I've had a few things on the menu. For starters, the Mussels are awesome. It's a large bowl so make sure you have an appetite. If you don't have as large of an appetite I like the Pate. It's a nice combination of flavors and it's lighter. For dinner I have the following faves: The Gage Burger, the big eyed tuna. If you have the appetite for it the Crisp potatoes with Brie are out of this world. <br><br>As for brunch, I was just dissapointed. I guess I had this idea of what a Gage brunch would be based on the fact that I love their dinner menu and find that they with the Menu selection.  I had been coming here for dinner so I was expecting an menu for brunch that was as well thought out.   Unfortunately that wasn't the case.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't the Gage I was expecting.  I'm cool with it though, now I know that the Gage and I are only on for dinner!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I have been here quite a few times and I was just getting ready to make a reservation for Friday when I realized that I have never given a review. <br><br>The location is great, the foot is great, the staff is great. <br><br>I know it's higher price point for bar type food, but the quality shows.  I will continue to go here time and time again.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I just called the Gage to inquire about bringing 20-25 people in for an \"after-dinner\" casual event and the guy that I spoke with, I think his name was Dave, was incredibly rude and was not interested in the least in helping me.  I've been here for dinner, drinks and  my company has held multiple private events in the past and I never expected to be treated so rudely.  <br><br>I will not be planning any events at the Gage in the future.<br><br>Gage - big mistake, HUGE.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Came here with my Dad while visiting for the weekend.  I got a fennel soup (special) and the famous rabbit salad.  Both were nice.  Dad got a crystalized lemon creme brule for dessert that was extraordinary.  it's a good idea to come for dessert alone.  <br><br>We enjoyed some great service here.  I'd come back on the weekend anytime.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I have been here a handful of times. <br><br>I think this place is really good if you want to hang with your girls after work, get hit on, or drink a few too many martinis.     <br> <br>The decor is lovely and the service is good.  As for the food, it's pricey.  Fifteen bucks for fish and chips?  You kidding, Gage?  I've had it and its not worth it.  Nothing I've ever eaten here stands out for me.    <br><br>On a side note, I am not crazy about the fact that you have to walk downstairs to use the restrooms, but that is because I have bad knees and a bum right foot and still have not given up high heel shoes.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "When i tried around 12  to make a reservation for 6pm on a Saturday it was booked so we walked in at 5:15 and got a table.

I hadn't even heard of either of these dishes before this evening, but thanks to Yelp reviews that suggested both, we went for it. Thank goodness we did. I've never tasted anything like either before and have no idea where we could even get something similar.  Both were unique and incredibly delicious. If you have to choose though, I'd go with Poutine... but plan a workout for the day after to work off the cheese/gravy/meat/french fry combination. <br><br>I've already written too much so I'll stop here.

Luckily, we were also told that we could go downstairs where there was a bar and order food. After making our way through the crowded upstairs bar, we found the stairs to the basement bar.

According to the menu, the cheese filling was made of butter kaase, brie and spinach. It's served with long strips of toast. And it was fantastic. The folks sitting next to us saw us enjoying ours and ordered one for themselves. There seems to be a lot of recommendations for the Scotch Egg. But if you're with a party where you don't know if everyone is going to be down with eating an egg for an appetizer, you might want to look into the Fondue. <br><br>For dinner, the wife got the fish and chips.  Like many others I'm sure, we had seen the Metromix piece about the fish and chips and wanted to try them out. My wife, who has tired multiple fish and chips dishes around the city, ranked them up with the best. If you didn't catch the TV piece, the fish and chips are wrapped in a newspaper. Check out the photo I've added. I got the prime burger with blue cheese, and it was one of the best burgers I have had in this city.

Somewhere outside planets must be aligning.  Astro Joe can you confirm that? <br><br>The Gage is a swanky little refuge from the tourists of Millennium park right on South Michigan Ave. They fancy themselves a gastropub and they certainly deliver on that. Their menu is creative, although it may be a bit overwhelming for the less adventurous types. However, there should be some variation of a stock option to suit your palate. They have tweaked their menu since the last time we were in, sadly the snacks have not changed and still seem bunk to me. I took advantage of the new items and got the BBQ turkey sandwich with caramelized onions and grainy mustard on a tasty pretzel roll like you'd find in Bavaria. Pretty damn good. Other noteworthy items on the list are the Fire Roasted Chicken, Fish and chips and the Gage Burger. Please don't cook that past Medium Rare and enjoy it with some of those great chips. The brunch menu looks good too, but I have not had anything from it yet. <br><br>They have an impressive selection of beers on tap. Usually a few Germans to be had and about the only place I've seen New Belgium seasonals. Why yes, I'll have another pint. <br><br>The place reminds me of an old bathhouse, which seems fitting.

The arugula was vibrantly green, as though it had something to prove, and sprinkled with crisp rice -- a textural nuance I very much enjoyed. The rabbit, hiding coquettishly under the bush, was warm, appropriately gamey (Daniel found it a bit too gamey), and plentiful.

The Gage, alas, overshot. Two links of a basil-infused sausage were much too fatty -- I could barely pick up my knife again after a few bites, thanks to the onset of Food Coma -- and a ruddy meat blend of a third link was only average. What's more, the beautiful, speckled mound of mustard was a total pacifist in its approach to flavor. Next to the heavy sausages was a charming pot of roasted potatoes -- oh wait, not just potatoes, but also BRIE. Really? It was a prelude to gout on a plate, it was. <br><br>Dessert made up for some of those missteps -- a rich and complex gingerbread came topped with brown sugar gelato and dried fruits.

I also noticed the couple next to us who later ate dinner, left at least half of their food on their plates.<br><br>We then ordered a few 3rd course dishes...I got the Rabbit salad and she ordered the lobster bites.  The salad was quite good but the amount of rabbit was extremely small, about 1 1/2 bites.  I love rabbit and have eaten it many many times, however this 'rabbit' didn't taste or look like rabbit at all, but rather dark meat turkey (which I love).  Her lobster had been caramelized in some sort of sauce, I tried a piece and although it was a nice hunk of lobster, the sauce made it so incredibly sweet and you couldn't taste the lobster at all.<br><br>For dinner she ordered duck and I ordered the ribeye.  My steak was cooked well and tasted excellent, I really enjoyed it!  As soon as they brought her duck out the gentlemen that dropped it off poured sauce all over the duck and all over her plate.  It was quite sloppily done.  I have been to many restaurants where a complimentary sauce was poured over the dish, BUT they should ALWAYS ask you to do it first!  The sauce was terrible and the duck was cooked medium well!!!!!  Come on folks, you can't over cook duck and serve it to people!  There was zero red, it was totally brown/grey looking cooked through meat and very very very tough and chewy.  The bartender who doubled as our waiter and whom was extremely nice, noticed her distaste by the look on her face.  He took it away right away and offered her anything else on the menu.  That was kind, we both really liked him.  She then ordered the chicken, but it was pretty dry, soggy skin on the outside and totally bland.

I ordered the special sandwich of the day (Which the server described beautifully).. prosciutto, fresh mozzarella cheese, arugula & stone ground mustard served on a beautiful baguette with fresh cut fries... omg. All of my favorite things in the world!<br><br>When we received our meals our table fell silent due to the fact that we were just truly loving our meals... oh was it good.<br><br>The only problem that we found.. and this is way minimal.. the bathrooms were down this stairway with no proper signage... you could get lost down there ie the private party room.. which looked pretty cool (I would have an event there). So like I said the problem is ultra small!<br><br>I will surely come back with my husband... and enjoy one of the many craft beers they have on tap!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Good gastropub but a bit pricey... to be expected given location.

The gage is a HUGE place. Big, noisy, with a somewhat adventurous menu. Our group had a wide assortment of food, including antelope tartar, chicken livers, hanger steak, risotto, fish & chips etc. The food was all good. Not great, but certainly above average. I would say the risotto was uninspired, but all in all, the food was well executed for a restaurant of this size. Service was a bit slipshod.  The wrong food was originally brought to our table, a forgotten drink order...   ...all quickly fixed at least.  It IS very noisy, and I'm not too big on the idea of a place that spendy  which has a lot of highchairs and screaming bratty kids.

The potatoes with brie are fantastic! I also had the day's quiche, which had zucchini, squash, tomatoes, and goat cheese. They were a bit too generous with the goat cheese and it overwhelmed the overall quiche but I wasn't wholly unsatisfied by it. It came with a really lovely side salad as well. My mom always gets the scotch egg, which she adores. She paired it with the day's watermelon soup and was extremely pleased. My dad really enjoyed the corned beef hash and had a side of goat cheese grits with it.

They are both called gastro pubs and both seem to cater to the after work or downtown tourist crowds. They both are a bit cramped and can get a bit loud. And you'll likely pay about the same. <br><br>HOWEVER - where State and Lake is dark and poorly organized, The Gage allows some semblance of privacy in the multiple compartments and semi-segregated rooms. The Gage is bright and airy with natural light coming in from the Michigan Avenue windows. The Gage has friendly staff, one particularly HOT bartender, a fun and fairly diverse clientele, and fantastic service from host station to meal to exit.<br><br>If you're looking for a romantic night out or a quiet dinner with a good friend, stop, turn around and go West away from Michigan Ave toward Blackbird or another West Loop spot.  If you're debating where to go after the Art Museum or a Chicago Symphony performance and you like the idea of a Gastropub, say \"NO WAY\" to State and Lake and go to The Gage, about 3 blocks away.<br><br>For lunch, order the Prime Rib sandwich - IT IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!

Went here after Rock of Ages on Sunday. We ordered the venison carpaccio to share - soooo rare and delicious.

The elk was heavenly! My hubby got that and I ate more than a taste of it because it was that good. The sausages were pork and venison, also very tasty, with a great smoky flavor. I had the mascarpone-leek ravioli in mushroom broth and it was really great. For dessert, we tried three things - the peanut butter french silk pie was to die for!! The banana bread sundae in the mason jar was also very good and we had the St Patrick's special chocolate cake, tasty.

That's right, a restaurant which has been in existence for only about two years has been the backdrop to some very memorable times in my life.

They didn't think twice about breaking their own seating rule by allowing my handicapped mother to sit before our party arrived, and then filled us in as our group slowly made our way in. <br><br>Food has always been fantastic here, and on this beautiful Sunday I followed my usual pattern by ordering a sandwich. I have never been disappointed by their sandwiches, and this time I had their Gunthorp Farms Pork sandwich. It is massive- served on a ciabatta roll, accompanied by melted brie, cabbage slaw and mustard- it is hardy, yet the flavors come through. Everyone around me enjoyed their meal and service was terrific. <br><br>Ambiance and decor are well thought out here coming across as a modern, urban pub. You get the feeling that it is still a pub without being clubbed over the head with the typical Irish-pub theme. The Gage allows the food to speak to you in that lovely Irish brogue, and I really appreciate that! Their use of subway tiles are exactly my style. Comfortable enough for a group of active walkers to sit and enjoy a great meal or drinks, and yet sophisticated enough to make it a date spot, or even a place to continue business talk after an important meeting. <br><br>The Gage is exactly what the heart of the loop needs as an all-purpose dining and drinking destination.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Since the office was a bit quiet, I decided to work from home today.  And by \"work from home\", I mean go to lunch and to the Art Institute with a friend.  I have been wanting to try the Gage since it opened and to my delight she agreed with my selection, so we met up around 12:30.  It was busy, but not overly so.  She started with a Champagne Charlie (made with Grand Marnier, blood orange bitters, and a rock of candied ginger in prosecco).  It was pretty good.  I had a Gage Ginger Fizz (Jameson, candied ginger, and I don't remember what else) and it was okay.  I also had an Old Fashioned, which was wonderful.  We split a Scotch Egg (hard boiled egg wrapped in sausage, coated with panko bread crumbs and fried, served with stone ground mustard) and it was surprisingly delicious.  She had a fire roasted chicken sandwich and I had the peppered salmon club sandwich.  Both were big, tasty portions which we could not finish.  I wish we had had room for dessert, but alas, we did not.  Service was very friendly and helpful with suggestions.<br>I am eager to return and try them for dinner (and another Old Fashioned).", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "My friend and I ordered:<br><br>House Poutine - fries with gravy with vegetables and and pieces of pork.
