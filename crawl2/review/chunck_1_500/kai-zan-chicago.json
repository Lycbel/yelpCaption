I made a reservation a week in advance for a table of 4 at 5pm (not many times were available a week in advance). It's a 2 hour time limit for a table of 4. <br><br>The restaurant is pretty small but has an intimate ambiance. My group was seated in a very cozy private booth. We started the night with 2 bottles of our own sake. Their BYOB policy is a 2 bottle limit and a $15 corkage fee. <br><br>We all ordered the standard Omakase $65 and upgraded with a $5 uni topper. <br><br>Madai Carpaccio: This carpaccio melted in your mouth and had so much flavor. Don't ignore the micro greens, they add a unique but fresh flavor. <br>Escolar & Magura Pearls: The escolar beat the tuna in this dish. <br>Angry Crab: The Angry Crab was our first dish with the additional uni. The uni was so sweet, I wish we had more! <br>Shooters: 2nd dish with the uni topper. The shooters were my favorite! Full of texture. <br>Orange Rush: Honestly, can't remember much about this dish? I guess it wasn't memorable. <br>Tuna Dashi: Soup break! <br>Main: My favorite cooked dish was the shrimp and the mushroom. The mushroom was plump and had a plesant grill taste. <br>Fiesta Maki: The fiesta maki was overpowered by clinatro. The chefs were nice enough to include an additional roll, the Flaming Tuna. I liked it a lot more than the Fiesta Maki. <br>Dynamite Mussels: Nothing too special about the mussel but they were damn good. The scallion mayo really brought it together. <br>Sashimi: I was struggling at this point, so much food! <br><br>The very final dish -- Matcha Creme Brulee (not included) <br><br>Overall this was a fun and enjoyable experience. The staff was super quick and knowledgeable.

I will make sure to come back every time I am in Chicago. If you go to Chicago and not come here, you made a huge mistake. <br><br>Setting- the restaurant is a cute warm oasis from the cold dreary streets of Chicago. It is decorated with rustic wood, candles, and warm colors. It is a small intimate place perfect for dates or close gathering with a few friends. It is the definition of cozy. <br><br>Service- we had our waiter, but also a number of different people would clear or plates, or bring out new dishes. Every time they brought out a new dish they would explain it. We were constantly checked up on. The food came out in perfect time. Right when we were done they would clear our plates and the next dish was set forth. There is a large jug of water on the table and a pot of tea so we wouldn't have to ask for refills. Yet they constantly checked our pot of tea to make sure it was full. Our waiter was so calm and obviously knew the menu and food inside out. <br><br>Food- We got the omakase meal which is a must. It includes all the best dishes on their menu. For only $65 it is a no brainer. Everything was delicious but my absolute favorites, I mean the ones I would have to rest my head on my hands because I couldn't take the deliciousness were orange rush, angry crab, escolar and maguro pearls. It was so filling and trust me my husband and I eat a lot, so if we say we were stuffed, you will be too. However, regardless of how full we save a special space for dessert. Dessert is not part of their set menu but you would be an idiot not to order it. We got the apple cake with yuzu. It was warm and perfection. <br><br>This was the most perfect place. If I can't convince you to go here, then you are hopeless. Go go go!

That is not hyperbole, nothing here disappoints. <br><br>The early bird (tues/wed) special is a great way to sample some of the standard Omakase's highlights. <br><br>For those in your party that don't LOVE sushi, there are a number of delectables on the menu. Think Karaage, Yakitori-style skewers (Yum mushroom!!!)<br><br>Because the ingredients and menus change (especially the Premium Omakase) I have never once been bored, underwhelmed or felt like I could have passed on any given bite. <br><br>Service: One of my favorite servers/waiters is usually in the building, being dope. <br><br>Seating: Cozy and cute.

Trust me you won't regret it!<br><br>Protip: even though they serve liquor they are still BYO and at a $15 corkage for 2 bottles it is very reasonable for the caliber of the place.  The liquor store across the street carries craft large bottle beers (e.g. Delirium or Unibroue) and a chilled sparkling Hitachino sake.  That makes an awesome compliment for the awesome food.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "So.

It is has a very fun and intimate setting. A bar that sits about 6-8 guest comfortably, a few tables, and on the other side, private intimate tables that sit about 6 guests comfortably, probably up to 8 if necessary. <br><br>The food here is good, but I'd like to say that the experience I had here, was much more like a Kaiseki meal rather than omakase sushi, in which they choose to call it. Kaiseki is traditional multi-course Japanese dinner, and this is more like that than sushi. A variety of appetizers and fish dishes. They did offer soy sauce, which we declined. <br><br>There are two levels of the meal, although we originally booked for the higher one, after seeing the menu, we determined it was way too much food for us to consume.<br><br>First Dish: Madai Carpaccio<br>- Japanese red snapper with toro, tobiko, dressed with olive oil and basil. Very delicious, I almost asked for extra, but I needed to be patient respectful of our meal. <br><br>Second Dish: Escolar Maguro Pearls <br>-Seared tuna and escolar dressed with scallions, truffle oil, and spicy mayo. Cute bite, alot of rich flavors going on<br><br>Third Dish: Angry Crab<br>- Spicy crab rapped in tuna, topped with tuna and spicy mayo. I wasn't a big fan of this one, I wanted to see fresh crab meat<br><br>Fourth Dish: Shooters<br>- two shooters with oysters, scallpops quail egg and tobiko. Cold and refreshing. Fiance loved, and he usually does not like shooters <br><br>Fifth Dish: Orange Rush<br>- Seared scallop, seared salmon with a dressing (orange?). This was delightful. The scallop was sweet and yummy. <br><br>Sixth Dish: Tuna Dashi<br>- Warm dashi broth with tuna, shiitake mushroom, little neck clams. Warm and delightful<br><br>Seventh Dish: Main one!<br>- Shrimp, Char Sui(like pork belly), Tako Yaki, Tako Wasabi. I did not like tako wasabi at all, but my fiance loved it, so we traded aha, the other dishes were unique <br><br>8th Dish: Fiesta Maki <br>-Salmon tuna avocado chili oil. This was like... a sushi roll. wasn't expecting that ...<br><br>9th Dish: Dynamite mussel<br>- your usual (single) grilled dynamite mussel with masago and spicy mayo <br><br>10th Dish: Sashimi<br>- Assorted fishes, Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, Nothing japanese imported or that exquisite.<br><br>He tossed in a few extra dishes on the house, but nothing highlighted to me.<br><br>It was a decent dinner, quite full, but wouldn't return. I would say it is a wonderful establishment, great pricing, and good to try. But I have traveled and always seek for omakase OR Kaiseki. I think they should reconsider that they are implying if they are going to say that they are serving Omakase, I understand omakase means leave it up to the chef, but this menu was pretty pre-set. Omakase shouldn't be pulled from the menu or preset, should always be seasonal. <br><br>Now this place is good, indeed.

This was also my first time dining at Kai Zan. I was looking for a really good sushi restaurant to celebrate my birthday. At first I couldn't get a reservation but called the restaurant to add my name to the waiting list. They called me asking if I was still interested for a table or 5 for 7:15 pm. I was so excited and reserved the table with a credit card. Kai Zan will charge your card if you cancel. <br><br>The service was excellent. The servers did a great job explaining the menu. Being that my party was new to Kai Zan our server recommended we do the Omakase at $65 per person for 10 courses. We agreed. They did a great job explaining the dishes. <br><br>I really enjoyed all the courses. I enjoyed the Asian fusion flare added to the meal. I really don't know how to explain it but omakase is NOT the sushi dinner consisting of orders a spicy tuna roll, shrimp tempura roll and few salmon and tuna nigiri. We did order a salmon roll afterwards bc some of us were still hungry. <br><br>We also ordered a bottle of champagne and I ordered sake. Can't remember the name of the sake but I really enjoyed it. We also ended the meal with in house made Ube Mochi, strawberry mochi, and mango mochi. <br><br>I'm very glad I got the chance to try Kai Zan and I highly recommend.<br><br>The only disappointment I had was our server didn't acknowledge my birthday at all even though it was noted on our reservation.

My friend told me I should go try sushi here. I looked at her like fish in Chicago where the ocean doesn't exist?!? I trusted her since, she used to live here and she knows what good food is. So thank god I got a reservation here on time (made it two days prior) at 945PM on a Friday night. <br><br>My boyfriend and I recently got into omakase, and when we saw the menu, we noticed they have omakase and premium omakase. At the time, the premium omakase was ~$120. This included items off the menu and is seasonal. We decided to opt for the premium since we were visiting Chicago and its not like we can just come back next week. NO REGRETS were made. Oh my god their omakase was amazing. It's not a traditional omakase, so everything was very modernized. The fish here were fresh. The uni, amazingly sweet and creamy and so plump. The server asked us if we wanted their last appetizer. It was the DIY uni toro hand roll. That appetizer was to die for. If I were put on death's row, that would be one of my top two dish I would eat before I get outed. The omakase also came with wagyu sliders, which melts in your mouth when you bite. There was a dish where the fish was smoked, so when you open the lid, a bunch of smoke came out and the smoke flavored the fish. I can go on forever, but this place is a must. <br><br>We also had a bottle of sake.

To note, this place books fast - I was looking close to two months prior and the earliest res I got for Friday was 8:45 pm. We arrived maybe 10 minutes earlier, and given their strict 1.5 hr allotments, we were seated close to our scheduled time. It is a little intense having to scarf down your omakase in that amount of time, often with dishes coming out on top of one another, if not at the same time, but to be fair, they at least are transparent about the timing at the forefront, so I guess that should be expected. I personally didn't mind as much, as it was an efficient use of my time.<br><br>I really enjoyed the space - on the small side, but not too much. There were nice nooks of seating. We were seated at the chef's bar, which I enjoy, but the separate booths certainly are more intimate.<br><br>Boo and I opted for a regular and premium omakase. Service overall was fantastic. We were regularly checked on and given a run down prior to each dish. All the staff were very friendly, waters were refilled and plates were consistently cleared. It was fun seeing the chefs in actions, and they certainly were very well organized and devoted to their work. It was nice that one of the brothers even asked how we were doing at one point.<br><br>I thoroughly enjoyed both omakases. I do have to say while the premium is more creative with higher quality ingredients (A5 wagyu and the fattier cuts of fish), the overall value wasn't quite there and was only marginally better for me. The dishes could have been more memorable. I found for both, that similar notes were often used for various dishes - e.g. I thought the basil lemon microgreens enhanced one dish while not the other and I don't know if the consistent use of edible flowers were necessary, except for a nice IG shot. There was a deep fried prawn, noted to be completely edible with the shell, except that I found it not as easy to go down as the more common, soft shell crab. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the dishes, as they were tasty. We had two soups, and both the broths were clean and tasty. I also enjoyed the scallop dish and all the quality sashimi. <br><br>Overall, I definitely enjoyed Kai Zan and would come back. Don't expect an authentic experience, as yes, you are on a time limit and the omakase is essentially pre-set (although they will cater to your needs). You def can be relieved that you at least won't have slow service here. Also, the chefs do fuse modern and traditional flavors here, so expect that and overall, good quality food.

I was watching the Tokyo episode from Parts Unknown recently (RIP Tony) and was inspired to experience an omakase menu. After reading great reviews on Kai Zan, I booked a table for two on a Thursday evening (no need for credit card with booking unless for 3 or more guests, I believe). <br><br>We were given a menu for the Chef's Choice and decided on this set (we added uni to some of our courses for $5 per person), rather than the premium set. There wasn't a specific menu for the premium choice, but the main seafood ingredients were listed on a chalkboard next to the kitchen. We started out with the Escolar and Meguro Pearls which were delicious. I also really enjoyed the Madai Carpaccio (delicious red snapper with basil miso), Angry Crab (crab wrapped in tuna (I know, it's insane)), Dynamite Mussels, and Fiesta Maki. I wasn't a huge fan of the Scallop and Oysters shooters but appreciated the freshness of the ingredients. I also expected more from the main course but by the time that came out (course #6-7?), I was extremely full. The plate of sashimi came at the very end which was unfortunate because I had no more room in my stomach at this point. I managed to take a bite of each of the different pieces and as expected, everything was super fresh. <br><br>The only downside to the experience was the time limit of 90 minutes. At times, I felt like we were being rushed and towards the end, our bill was sent to us before we even received our last course. I understand the turnover that has to happen but wished they gave us a little more time to relish in the flavors more.

Out of the 10 items, my favorite were the escolar pearls. They will render you speechless. They lightly torch the escolar and give it a smoky flavor.

Food is served to you in a super organized structure, and you won't experience a long gap or need to wait between two courses for sure. <br><br>My favorite dish would probably be the uni tartare that's off the omakase menu. The uni has a super rich, satisfying texture - wrapping the tartare in the crunchy seaweed adds another layer to it! Within the omakase menu, the first couple of appetizers are simply amazing. The last couple of main dishes could be a bit salty. <br><br>Overall, great experience and I'll be back again! This restaurant is definitely on par with momotaro, if not better. Also, remember to get the lava cake!! I love Japanese desserts and the lava cake here paired with black sesame ice cream will wrap up your dinner pretty well, and send you home with a happy tummy. :)", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Best sushi experience in Chicago!

The oysters were refreshing and cleansed the mouth between the competing tastes of the other dishes. All of the fish nigiri were outstanding - the tuna and hamachi were smooth and silky, but the salmon belly rose above them both with its richness. I was a little disappointed with the wagyu beef, both when served on its own and as nigiri. The juices caramelized on the surface of the meat, providing a promising first bite, but the flavor held little longevity. The karaage was ordinary, despite the hope offered by the marinated chicken meat. The hamachi collar was the most popular dish among our table of four, though I preferred the salmon nigiri. It took little encouragement for the white fish to fall from its frame, and even less so for it to melt in the mouth. It was accompanied by a ponzu-scallion sauce and grated daikon radish which brought a welcome salty kick to the otherwise unassuming hamachi. The braised octopus - a special of the day - was lightly-charred and its toughness changed up the texture profile of the evening. We finished our meal with mango mochi, lava cake, and matcha creme brulee. Most dessert lovers could find satisfaction somewhere across the selection, and indeed this dessert skeptic enjoyed sampling all three.<br><br>Setting & Atmosphere: 4-5 stars<br><br>We were lucky enough to be seated at one of several large booths along the left wall of the restaurant. We had the utmost privacy - we neither saw nor were seen by other customers during our meal - but the chatter in the air reminded us there were plenty of other lucky souls enjoying their meals too.<br><br>Drink: 4 stars<br>We each took a beer, and were pleasantly surprised to find the Asahi offered was not the Super Dry but instead the Select amber lager.<br><br>Service: 5 stars<br>I have nothing but compliments for our server, Brian. He knew the menu inside out, offering sensible alternatives where our first choices were unavailable. We ordered several off-menu items on his recommendation, including the show-stealing salmon belly nigiri. Service was attentive, comically so at one point when replacement chopsticks were provided within seconds of a pair falling to the floor.<br><br>Value: 4 stars<br>The a la carte menu varies in its value-for-money - the daily collar offers an entree-sized amount for cooked fish for ~$14, but you would need to spend 2-3X that on appetizers to feel full. You should go to Kai Zan expecting to spend well for some of the best raw fish in Chicago. With such an approach, the omakase at $65 a head looks outstanding value.<br><br>Return: Yes<br>I could return and eat exclusively fish, as the tuna, salmon, and hamachi were the freshest I've tasted in Chicago. I would like to check out the chef's omakase too - while the chicken and beef play second fiddle to the fish here, they would still be upper quartile across Chicago restaurants.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hruK6-HidFflYMtjRYJEjw/348s.jpg", "caption": "Tuna and hamachi nigiri"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Vdj725B-zqxFOKiDQjfyEQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Hamachi kama"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pX__R2z0_beBpIfV1gUv2A/168s.jpg", "caption": "Karaage"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Amazing experience at Kai Zan for a birthday celebration!

I was a bit put off by the time we were given. I was thinking to myself is that considered dinner or a late lunch? But I really wanted to treat my bf to omakase for our 4 year anniversary so took it anyways. After all, it's my fault to making the last minute reservation. We tried the chef's menu and premium menu. The chef's menu is $65 for 10 courses. The premium menu is double the price with the same number of courses, but not twice the quality. For some reason, they don't print out the premium menus either. I would stick to the chef's menu. Food was fresh and delicious; a great value for omakase style. It's easily one of the better Japanese restaurants in the city. My favorites were the escolar & maguro pearls (2nd) and fiesta maki (8th). On the premium menu, the most memorable items were the fresh wasabi where the wasabi is cut up in tiny chunks, and the dessert which was ice-cream with passion fruit pure and crumble. If I'm paying $120 for a multi-course meal and stating the most memorable items being a condiment and ice-cream, I think it's safe to conclude it just didn't blow me away. To sum up the experience, we were running 5 minutes late, and when I called to let them know, I was told we had 90 minutes to finish and we might not get seated if we don't get there soon. A friend of mine who went recently said she had 2 hours to eat, so it's not the case everyday. Perhaps it's just a Saturday thing since there're more diners so they have to be rigid in sticking to the schedule. The staff choreographed beautifully in bringing out the dishes and taking them away promptly, but we felt rushed. The bill was handed to us at 6pm sharp. They asked if I was celebrating a special occasion the day before when they called to confirm my reservation. I told them my anniversary. When dinner was done, we ordered a dessert (additional one outside of the omakase meals), but there was no effort put into decorating the dessert, and we ended up paying for it. I'll admit that I'm used to restaurants now waving the cost of the dessert for special occasions or at lease decorating it, but either way, why ask me if I'm celebrating anything if they don't plan on doing anything for the guests? We walked out a little after 6pm and it was still bright.

This is my second time eating here and I enjoyed my experience thoroughly. The service here is very fast, probably because you only have a set amount of time to dine. For two people, I believe it is around ninety minutes to finish your meal before you have to leave.<br><br>I ordered omakase both times I came here and noticed that a few menu items had changed. I was excited to see that this time, the orange rush was incorporated into the omakase menu. This was one of my favorite dishes that I had ordered a la carte the first time, but it added a hefty $10 to my bill. Overall, I thought the omakase menu allowed you to get a nice taste of many different items, however, not all of the dishes wowed me. My favorites were the escolar pearls and orange rush. Some misses for me were the oyster/scallop shooters (I'm not a fan of shooters) and char siu (which was a bit too tough for me to enjoy). I also ordered the uni hand-roll (not on the omakase menu) which looked spectacular, but for $28 I felt that it was a bit underwhelming. The uni was very fresh, however, and was a nice touch.<br><br>Make sure you save room for dessert! I almost think that the house-made desserts are better than the fish...! The green tea ice cream had an extremely strong green tea flavor which I loved. It did not taste artificial at all like many other green tea ice creams. The chocolate lava cake was pretty good as well and was a nice contrast to the ice cream.<br><br>If you just order omakase, the bill ends up being a bit over $80 per person which is certainly not cheap. I think it is a reasonable price for what you get and it is less expensive than what you would pay for a tasting menu at some other restaurants. Omakase was good, but some of the dishes were misses for me simply because I was not a fan of the ingredients. If I came back in the future, I would definitely order a la carte so that I can get foods that are more suited for my taste.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9kSgTi14jwNAQ0un2EPWTg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Desserts!

MY FAVORITE COURSE OF THE EVENING was either the oyster and scallop shooters or the sashimi. <br><br>The only reason I am taking off a star is because my friend and I both felt that the sashimi was so so so fresh that it should be set as one of the beginning courses and not dead last.

But....the service was douchey.  We came to celebrate 3 out of 5 people in our party bc it was our birthdays so we were in it to win it and try everything.  Our server, while I'm sure a nice enough fellow was very snooty and kept interrupting us during our birthday celebration in a snotty way.  When 3 out of 5 of us decided to order the omakase chef's special, his demeanor changed and he was more polite.  Part of his attitude probably had to do with the alcohol we brought bc of their byob policy.  We admittedly brought in a lot of different saki's and Japanese beers to try with our meal bc of byob policy.  But it's very unclear what their policy is.  Is it even posted anywhere officially?  I couldn't find it after all of this occurred just found bloggers and reviewers posts.  We were under the impression that there was a 2 bottle min and for every 2 bottles there's a $15 corking fee.  But after already opening 2 bottles of single bottle beers, we were told we were done, it was only a 2 bottle policy.  First of all...there really should be better rules for single beer bottles vs a bottle of wine.  You get 4-5 servings out of a wine bottle vs a single bottle of beer.  The server was wishy washy about it, upset, then fine that we had already opened the bottles....we were celebrating so we didn't really take that into account and didn't want to let it ruin our evening, so we opened some very small sake bottles to try and then all of a sudden the manager trips over to lecture us on respecting their policy.  I'm sitting there dumbfounded bc I'm still unclear on what their policy is and how they now serve alcohol, etc.  Honestly I think half our table still didn't understand either and we had to talk it over long after the principle, I mean the manager left our table.  Long story short, we respectfully put our alcohol away (they wanted to take it from us to ensure we didn't open any more unauthorized bottles and we assured them we wouldn't) and we're forced to order from their alcohol menu.  Really Kai Zan, eliminate byob if you are pushing your liquor now.  People who come to eat your amazing food WILL pay for your liquor too.  Not even sad to say I will not go back for a while, possibly ever.  Not worth the douchey service, and kind of ruined our night.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Great food and service.

This is actually a 3 star review but i want the owner to take note of this. The restaurant is small, as other reviewers have said so definitely reserve a table, especially if you want to try the omakase menu. The service was good because the server gave a thorough explanation of each course. I tried the PREMIUM omakase with 3 other friends and we ordered the unitoro tar tar, oyster shooter, grilled scallop nigiri and the purple yam mochi on the side. The unitoro tar tar is a must if you come. The omakase started off really well and I had high hopes. The first few courses hit several senses such as taste, smell, and visual. It started off with Alaskan king crab with vinaigrette which helps with the appetite. The 3rd course was a beef slider with beef from Japan. The bread was crumbly and the texture and taste was very one dimensioned. It felt like a waste of good beef. But it was redeemed with the 4th course. And that's when things started going down hill. The dashi course was salty and didn't have any other flavor. There was a fried oyster course that's not pictured. It came out of left field and didn't really go well with the rest of the courses. The broth was good and tasted like clam chowder. However the fried oyster left a very bad fishy taste in my mouth. It was very rich with nothing to cut through the richness and didn't prepare us well for the next course, sashimi. The sashimi course was also very fishy. It was an endless amount of fishiness. The pickled vegetables and fresh wasabi on the side definitely helped. I know Chicago isn't close to the ocean so I didn't expect the fish to be amazingly fresh. However, I will say the uni was fresh and some bites tasted like a mouth full of delectable ocean.  The dessert was a huge disappointment and was the last straw for me. The server described it as a deconstructed cheesecake and it was anything but that. It was literally fresh fruit and yogurt with a few pieces of mint. It didn't finish the meal off well, especially with the previous course being raw fish. I even told the person over the phone that I was celebrating my birthday and when they called to reconfirm, they recalled that it was my birthday. However, I didn't get anything to commemorate this special day. The mochi was $5 for ONE piece, cut into 4 and they couldn't give that to me on house. I paid $190 with tip per person and they couldn't give me a better dessert aside from freaking yogurt and fruit. As i left, the person up front even said happy birthday. It added salt to my wound. After seeing on yelp, even regular omakase had better food than the premium that i got. Perhaps the biggest difference is the types of fish we got for the sashimi. I feel so ripped off, especially after paying so much, twice as much as the regular omakase. The price point did not justify what we ate. A few courses wowed me with a 9/10 but most of them were an average 5.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Waiter told me since he was a waiter, it's none of his business for my logistics recommendations to the restaurant, when I suggested they should begin a valet service because of the impossible street parking nearby that left us no time to take the tasting menu.

This restaurant exceeds expectations in every way possible, from the time you're greeted by the host until you leave, everything is A+++.<br><br>The staff is nothing short of amazing. While you are in the presence of the two most amazing Sushi Chef's (Melvin and Carlo) on earth, you also have the opportunity to meet a extremely friendly and personable line up of hosts and wait staff. Every single one of them ensures that your experience is unforgettable.

Just to start off, I've virtually tried just about every single dish on the menu and can confidently say, its all amazing. Not only is every dish unique, well thought through and different from   other \"common\" sushi spots, but the QUALITY of the ingredients used is a huge difference maker. Melvin and Carlo will only serve you the highest quality of fish/seafood and if they are unable to source ingredients that meet their expectations, well then it won't be on the menu (specifically Uni).<br><br>Personal favorites and must try list:<br><br>Escolar Pearls-I wish they offered a \"bottomless\" special of this dish, the first time I tried these I ordered them 3 times...stop judging me.<br><br>Maguro Pearls-A close 2nd to the Escolar Pearls, absolutely incredible.<br><br>Dynamite Mussels-Personally, I had a strong dislike of the texture of mussels my entire life, until the Chef's recommended I try them....they're unlike any mussels you'll ever have and an absolute must order-the flavor is mind blowing!<br><br>Angry Crab-I recommend getting these as hand rolls (not on the menu), it is hands down the best hand roll you will ever eat in your entire life, don't take my word for it, try it and I guarantee you will order at least 2 during your meal.<br><br>Uni Toro Tartare Special-If they have Uni, they will most likely offer this special. I recommend you order this because its unlike any dish you will ever eat anywhere else. You receive a beautifully presented dish with Uni, Toro, Pickled Wasabi and a Qual Egg on top (there's more in there...trust me) which you mix up and then create your own rolls of goodness with....this one is arguably my favorite dish all together, ever!<br><br>Green Monster-This roll is presented beautifully, its a avocado wrapped roll that is second to none and extremely delicious!<br><br>Polenta Bites-Another creation that is over the top. Its simple, but the flavor is HUGE!<br><br>King Oyster Mushroom-Unlike any mushroom dish you will ever taste in your life. The consistency and flavor if this make it hard to believe you're eating a mushroom skewer!<br><br>All of their shooters are amazing but the Uni Shooter is my favorite. The concept is actually not something I generally would \"enjoy\" but after having tried all of them I can now understand why they are so popular!<br><br>I recommend always getting any and all specials they have, these are always the absolute BEST and AMAZING creations. You will never want to miss out on these. If you show your face often enough, you may even get lucky from time to time and have them re-created....only if you're lucky though!<br><br>I recommend you sit at the Sushi Bar if you have the ability to, watching the Chef's in action adds to the experience.

interesting, almost smoky flavor.  Very good ginger.  Pickled wasabi.<br> <br>- Note, a lot of their fish are fatty cuts, but often marinated.  That is fine with me, as I imagine they might not get fish from Tokyo every day, and sushi is meant to be marinated :)<br><br>2) Raw wagyu beef with a touch of toro and caviar in a maitake mushroom sauce (4/5) - this was almost an amuse bouche, in that it was one bite, I thought it should have come before the salmon<br><br>3) Pei wei served katsu style with sweet potato tempura (3/5) -- Pei wei (?) is a Brazilian fish, and it was fried with a curry flavor.  I'm not as big on fried dishes, so I knocked this a point, but many people would probably like it.  The black plate was a bit severe<br><br>4) Chawanmushi with rice chip, radishes and caviar (5/5) -- loved this.  This is where I became very impressed.  Very good egg custard, and the crispy rice was an interesting garnishment, which was meant to be broken into the soup almost like an oyster cracker<br><br>5) Wagyu beef seared with crisp greens (5/5) -- extremely strong.  They source their waygu from Japan and it was cooked perfectly.  This is reason enough for the premium omakase.  I'm still salivating<br><br>6) Toro, lobster with uni, and hotate with truffle oil nigiri (4.5/5) -- I liked the nigiri course at this juncture, because they went with big flavors.  Almost everything was marinated except the uni.  The toro was delicious, and the hotate with truffle oil melted in my mouth <br><br>- The rice was very good with nice flavor, although a touch cold for me (should be room temperature or a bit above).  They serve three pieces at a time, which isn't a crime, but doesn't necessarily shine (sorry for the rhyme)<br><br>7) Ika plus asparagus (3/5) -- This was a little dry compared to some of the other luscious dishes, although the pairing had an interesting crunch which served as an effective contrast to the oily aspect of the previous course<br> <br>8) Hamachi kama (4/5) -- I added this, as I was craving a classic dish.  The hamachi kama was cooked perfectly and was very juicy.  There was a very good ponzu sauce and pickled cabbage.  I enjoyed the miso soup with which it came (heavy on the tofu and mushrooms)<br><br>9) Marinated toro with pickled wasabi and sea salt (5/5) -- they go big on the toro here, and the pickled wasabi is a lot of fun.  if you're a fan of Hayakawa down in Atlanta, you'd appreciate it here, too<br><br>10) Cold smoked marinated Hamachi with pickled wasabi and micro greens and caviar (4/5) -- another strong dish, and it reminded me a lot of Uchi due to the smoke effect  (think Jar Jar Duck of Uchi fame)<br><br>11)  Sashimi plate - Hamachi belly, toro, madai served with pickled wasabi (5/5) -- loved this.  Perfect cuts.  All very delicious.  I found it surprising to be served sashimi  at the end, but the server made note of this that they like to mix it up, and since the flavors were so rich it held up nicely<br><br>12) Cucumber, king crab, uni roll (5/5) -- the chef comped this for me, which I found very kind.  It was a refreshing dish, and the uni was so sweet which paired nicely with the crisp cucumber and delicious, succulent crab.  It was almost a palette cleanser<br><br>13) Nigiri dessert course (3/5) - uni, tamago, unagi.  The uni was delicious.  Straight from Santa Barbara.  The tamago was not layered as tightly as I would have expected and the searing was too dramatic, which took away from the lightness of the egg.  The unagi was BBQ'd too aggressively.  They were out of anago<br><br>Service here is 5/5.  Everyone is extremely pleasant and even jovial.  The chefs are not Japanese, but clearly have mastered many aspects of the craft and I did not notice any diminution of knife skills.  They are very talented.  The space is cool, although the sushi bar is not large so make sure you get your spot.  I have this place tied with Katsu in Chicagoland for sushi omakase.  Katsu, of course, is where to go for more tradition nigiri, albeit with gold leaf, and Kai Zan is where to go for a great time and a lot of different tastes", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Q9OqCckZdqWtxMrxiyZttQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "Unagi"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EYcCRG0oSKYsHjho34vnlA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Uni"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nlWDG9WTxL1AjHYloV091g/168s.jpg", "caption": "Tamago"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "I decided to go for solo dining on my birthday and went to Kai Zan and tried their famous Omakase.<br> IT WAS FANTASTIC!<br>Every course they served was a piece of art.

Even though they were only 3 minutes past the 15 min deadline (5:48 vs. 5;45), she wouldn't let them order the omakase.<br><br>This whole experience along with the attitude of the lady on the phone has left a real poor mark on Kai Zan. She was very passive aggressive and kept replying \"I appreciate it\" when I pleaded to allow my family who flew in from out of town to order the omakase. Appreciate what?!<br><br>Yes, we were late by 3 minutes, so our fault. However, the way the restaurant and the lady on phone handled the situation is not customer friendly.

My favorites were the madai carpaccio, escolar pearls, and the polenta bites (I think--this was on the house). While I'm usually not a huge fan of anything that deviates from traditional sushi, I appreciated the creativity that went into the rolls--the flavors were unique and well thought out. The kale in the polenta bites, for instance, was crispy, and the slightly bitter flavors worked surprisingly well with the toro. We also got an order of the madai collar, which was also quite good and well priced for the portion size.<br><br>The one thing I would stay away from would be the traditional sashimi; this may have been an off day, but the sashimi I had was not very fresh, especially the maguro, which was a very oxidized, dark color.

We don't like to celebrate Valentine's Day, but we still needed a reason to have a nice dinner date night, so we decided that this would be our Valentine's dinner. I'm sure we could have found any old reason to come here, though. It's the best sushi in Chicago!<br><br>I've already been here a couple times but it was his first time. I guess you could say that I popped his Kai Zan cherry *high fives all around*. He got the omakase and I got some a la carte dishes off the menu. It was THE perfect way that we could enjoy a variety of their best dishes. For those of you who don't know, the omakase is the \"chef's choice\" course meal of on-the-menu AND off-the-menu favorites, so you get the entire spectrum (literally, all different colors and textures) of dishes that they have to offer. And ever since they posted their new uni toro tartare dish on their FB page, I've been dreaming of and totally drooling over it. So it worked out that I didn't get the omakase, because who can afford getting the omakase AND ordering this dish? Maybe all you big baller shot callers out there, but not me.<br><br>Just a quick note about the service here: our server was super friendly and informative. I wonder how long it took him to memorize every ingredient in the dishes he would bring out? Mad props. And the chef brothers are amazing with their culinary creations, which makes for a very legit omakase.<br><br>My top 3:<br><br>Uni-Toro Tartare: Holy mother of sea urchins, batman! I was definitely in UNI HEAVEN with this dish and I will definitely get it every single time I return. Because this #unilover just can't get enough! The uni and toro are served with quail eggs and some other delicious goodness that I can't seem to remember (wasabi and other stuff), all over a bed of rice. It's best to mix it all in together so that you end up getting all the flavors in one bite. There's a side of several small sheets of nori that you can wrap the tartare in. DIY sushi FTW!<br><br>Hamachi collar: OMFG this was melt in your mouth food porn awesomeness! The meat was SO tender and buttery and paired well with the ponzu sauce that came on the side. It's a fairly medium sized collar with plenty of fish meat to pick off, so I'm very glad that we got to try this. It's sold at market price, which was only about $14. Some places will charge more than that, so we were pretty happy that it wasn't incredibly expensive.<br><br>Uni/Oyster Shooters: First of all, the presentation is beautiful. The shooters come in a lovely martini shaped glass and you can see the uni (or oyster) in the ponzu sauce. And then on top, you see a gorgeous sprinkling of black tobiko (fish eggs), an egg porn worthy quail egg, and chopped scallions. Since the uni (or oyster) and quail egg is more on the \"slimy\" side as far as texture goes, it's balanced out with the flavor pops of the black tobiko and the crunch of the scallions. And then of course, the lemony ponzu sauce ties it all together so that it's not too \"heavy\".<br><br>It is no longer BYOB but they offer beer and wine.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uzfH0MkSnYqSbRz_pkZ5Gg/348s.jpg", "caption": "Maki roll towards the end of the omakase course"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4TzMXaYQQK4Byj6sXnSbTw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Sashimi"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/k9HYu8jShuo9NfZroKDCbw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Uni toro tartare"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Might be the best sushi I've ever had.

This is one of my favorites i usually dont like acidic dishes because there to acidic but this isnt at all the orange flavor goes perfectly with the richness of the fish. The seafood is cooked perfectly <br><br>Grilled scallop nigiri: omg when scallops are cooked perfectly its like eating a cloud just melts in ur mouth the sauces went perfect with the fish to make it rich but not to overpowering a must order!!<br><br>Tuna belly: if u never tried tuna belly order it now its better then any other tuna sushi u ever had before. This is really high quality topshelf tuna. Its cooked perfectly so it melts in ur mouth ur tastebuds will love u if u order this<br><br>Yaki soba: i was a little skeptical but its delicious this is the only dish where they give u a big portion. The noodles are cooked perfectly seasoned beautifully theres alot of texture i recommend ordering it with a meat <br><br>Char sui (pork belly) omg omg best pork belly ever!! Its so good i love pork belly this by far was my favorite rendition of it. Its cooked perfectly so the fatty parts melt in ur mouth its not tuff at all.

Its so rich like it has such a great fish flavor cooked perfectly the sauce adds a much needed salty richness u wont regret ordering this<br><br>Charred kabocha (best dessert ever) picture like a pumpkin pie but a 100 times better it was amazin the pumpkin was cooked perfectly not hard seasoned just right to remind u of thanksgivin.

We have lived in Chicago for four years now and struggled to find something on par with where we have lived previosuly until we discovered Kai Zan in November 2012. <br><br>In many ways, this has been our baby. We have watched it grow from a 17 seater relatively easy place to get a reservation place to a restaurant highly recommended and regarded by lthe ocal food press. That said, the service and personal touch has not changed as the place has grown up.<br><br>The wait staff are really good and welcoming. Each table is given a 2 hour allocation, but we find them very accomodating if the group is having a good time and you run over a little bit. <br><br>The owners Carlo and Melvin are a real treat.

They make an effort to come by the tables to interact with the guests. Both of them are incredibly humble and warm people. One can even get off menu items.

I was very excited to try Kai Zan after hearing that it's one of the best sushi restaurants in the city, but sadly it was a let down. I opted out for the chef's menu and my foodie in arms had some apps and chicken teriyaki. Chicken teriyaki was decent even though the sauce was on a sweeter side. However, it has huge pieces of fat which weren't trimmed. You could find a better filleted  chicken at a run of the mill Chinese place. The chefs menu started with Madai Carpaccio, which was very pleasant in taste, however I had to spit out one of the pieces, because the fish wasn't fillet properly, so I got an unchewable piece of skin and tendons. We were off to a bad start, Kai Zan. Maduro pears were excellent, but oyster shooters came next. I'm not a huge fan of oysters, but Kai Zan wouldn't do any substitutions, so I went with it. The shooters were ok, definitely nothing authentic about them, as they involved tabasco sauce. I might be forgetting a couple of courses, but one of them was just dashi, the Japanese broth. Then four plates came out, which was a single shrimp of some kind (ok), Tako Yaki (bland), a piece of pork (bland) and finally octopus (too rubbery). The last two courses were salmon rolls and sashimi, which were the most enjoyable part of the meal, as the fish was very fresh and it was nice getting back to the basics after the rest of the chef's nonsense. Overall, the chefs menu has a couple of great dishes, but the rest were mediocre to forgettable. If I was to go again, I'd order a la carte. <br><br>The service: 2.5/5. Our reservation was at 5.15 and the person on the phone said they had no spots available for later. To my surprise, the two of us were the only people at the sushi bar the entire duration of our meal. The staff let us know at least 3 times that we had only 90 minutes to finish our meal, so they kept rushing us and were bringing out courses and pilling them at the table, instead of giving me a chance to finish my previous dish. This made it for one non enjoyable experience. <br><br>Overall: 3/5. The chef's selection and the service left a bad taste in my mouth, so I have no desire to go back.

This way you are able to try out a little bit of everything on their menu. You won't regret the decision, I promise. There was so much food and it almost seemed endless. In addition to the tasting menu, we ordered the uni toro tartare and dessert in the end. <br><br>One of my favorite dish of the night was the uni toro tartare! I love the DIY concept to this dish, and it almost seem endless. You just need to work for your food. Mix the tartare together really good and channel your inner sushi chef to make your own rolls. <br><br>As much of a turn off the time limit is when you make the reservations, I did not feel at all pressured during the service. We did take a bit of time to make a decision, but our server was very patient with us. He walked us through the menu and elaborated on any questions I had along with making great suggestions. <br><br>The pace was on point, however my ONLY critic is that from sitting at the bar and seeing how the kitchen flowed, what I noticed was the timing and preparation of the food. Some of the hot food was sitting there longer than I would have liked it because when I got my food expecting it to be hot, it was warm, if not almost cold. Of the hot food, only the soup and dynamite mussel were actually hot. Everything else minus the raw stuff were almost cold, which was a bit disappointing. <br><br>The concept of clean and simple flavors is what I left with at this place. The tasting menu flowed from simple to variety and back to simple again. Nothing distracted your palette of the original flavors. As the tasting menu ends with a showcasing a selection of sashimi, I thought was genius because the menu took you on such an adventure, but made sure to remind you of the origin with the main ingredients of the night, fish. Just the concept of something as simple as fish can be created and paired with different things, but yet alone it can still be appreciated. <br><br>To end this wonderful experience, we had a cup of green tea (FREE) and Cashew Panna Cotta. Not too sweet or heavy. Simple but yet so many textures and layers involved in just a little dessert. It was the perfect way to celebrate my birthday dinner!

Not only did he agree with her, but said he would let the chefs know the input (which I fully believe he actually did). <br><br>I honestly have never had a dish here that I didn't like, but there are a few that you cannot miss:<br><br>- angry crab <br>- uni shooters<br>- orange rush<br>- there was a waygu beef special roll that we had that was amazing!<br>- grilled hamachi nigiri<br>- madai carpaccio (our tables favorite along with the angry crab)<br><br>Do the omakase menu and you'll actually save money as its only 60 dollars and you'll be full by the end. You can ask them to include certain dishes on the menu that you are eyeing so you don't miss them for a slight up-charge as well (usually 10 dollars).<br><br>I cant say enough about this place - every bite is heaven. Reservations are a must as the place is very small - but if you have to wait there is a cute store next door with great little gifts.<br><br>Go here before you die you wont regret it!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/farCQReMnqZ5ZkQYsdNwyQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "Omakase - six of the ten courses I had"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Second time I'm there - had the classic Omakase.

In other words, I tasted more of the tuna, not much of the spicy crab itself.  <br>6) char siu/beef tataki: surprisingly, this meat dish was light because of the addition of yuzu.  <br>7) shiitake mushroom soup: it also featured a tiny piece of oyster on the bottom.  I enjoyed the broth; it was flavorful yet simple.<br>8) an assortment of entree dishes: what a luxury way to present the takoyaki!  Although the takoyaki wasn't my favorite, the octopus with wasabi sauce was a nice change-up for the palate!  You could definitely experience \"umami\" with this chef's creative combo.  <br>9) dynamite mussel: the flavor of sake was soaked throughly into the mussel.  Sprinkling some of the lemon juice was a must!  I'm now have a brand-new perspective on mussels.  <br>10) fiesta maki: how could you go wrong with avocado and fresh raw seafood?  <br>11) an assortment of sashimi: the presentation was impeccable!  That was an awesome final chapter of the Omakase.  <br><br>The service was very attentive.  Dining at Kai Zan was certainly an unforgettable experience.  I have no doubt that we will be back for the premium Omakase!  <br><br>The street parking was fairly easy on Chicago Ave.  Otherwise, the CTA 66 (Chicago) bus can take you there, and be sure that you get off at Rockwell/Chicago.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Literally the best sushi ever.

I could eat an entire plateful of these. <br><br>Madai carpaccio - thinly sliced red snapper served with what tasted like balsamic vinegar, olive oil, tobiko, etc. <br><br>Char sui - braised pork belly with black garlic sauce and greens. The pork belly was cooked to perfection.<br><br>Lightly grilled tuna with fried polenta and seaweed - the different textures and contrast of hot/cold complimented each other very well.<br><br>Although there were many other dishes served in the omakase, these were the ones that I would absolutely order again. <br><br>The desserts left a little to be desired, but I was impressed with the meal as a whole.

The small, intimate setting of Kai Zan was the cherry on top. Not too loud, not too many people. We decided on the omakase 10-course meal and it was the best decision ever.

The restaurant itself is very tiny with limited seating so making reservations in advance is highly recommended (almost required if you're in a large group). There are seats at the sushi bar as well as intimate cozy booths where we were seated (booths seat six people comfortably). After taking our seats, we were greeted by our server who gave each of us hot towels to clean our hands which I thought was a very lovely touch. He explained the concept of the restaurant and answered any questions we had regarding the menu. For those who haven't been to Kai Zan, I recommend going with the chef's choice omakase which costs you $60, but you get to sample some of the most popular items on the menu and it's so much food! This way, the next time you come (...and you will be back, trust me...), you'll know exactly what to get. Below is what we had on the omakase menu on our visit to Kai Zan with some extra dishes.<br><br>COURSE 1 - ESCOLAR and MAGURO PEARLS<br>Our omakase experience off with a big flavorful bang. These pearls were an absolute treat. I contemplated ordering more after finishing my four pieces. Hell, I contemplated stealing my friend's pearls while they weren't looking. These little nuggets of deliciousness are topped with soy and truffle oil soaked scallions which take the incredibly fresh cuts of fish to another level.<br><br>COURSE 2 - MADAI CARPACCIO <br>Slices of red snapper topped with fatty toro, black tobiko that pops in your mouth and drizzled with olive oil and soy sauce. I enjoyed this dish, but to be honest, I was still thinking about those pearls lol<br><br>COURSE 3 - OYSTER AND SCALLOP SHOOTERS<br>I have been looking forward to trying the shooters ever since we booked the reservation and they did not disappoint! Both shooters were served in a citrusy ponzu sauce with a rich quail egg and dash of spicy Tabasco sauce. The meaty scallop was so sweet and succulent, but my favorite was the briny oyster shooters. I could've eaten another 5 or 10 - SO GOOD!<br><br>COURSE 4 - \"ANGRY CRAB\" <br>The angry crab was a tasty bite with spicy crab wrapped in fresh tuna and topped with crispy tempura flakes <br><br>COURSE 5 - \"TUNATINI\" <br>This course was a party in your mouth because there were so many different textures with each bite you took from the buttery tuna to the crispy polenta to the herbaceous shiso leaf to the salty black tobiko that popped in your mouth.<br><br>COURSE 6 - DASHI<br>This piping hot cup of dashi broth was just what we needed on a cold rainy Chicago night loaded with mushrooms, tuna, clams and sesame seeds -- warmed and satisfied our tummies.<br><br>COURSE 7 - SHRIMP. TAKOYAKI. PORK BELLY. OCTOPUS SALAD<br>Sampling of four dishes: shrimp was served with shiitake and garlic butter. The takoyaki was perfect -- crisp exterior and gooey center with octopus inside topped with wasabi mayo and bonito flakes. The pork belly was so unctuous, tender and juicy; it practically melted in my mouth. The octopus salad ways my least favorite out of the quartet of offerings -- too much wasabi that overwhelmed everything else in the dish.<br><br>COURSE 8 - DYNAMITE MUSSELS<br>These are gigantic New Zealand mussels that are steamed with sake and topped with black tobiko and negi mayo. AMAZING -- I need the recipe because I could devour a platter all by myself.<br><br>COURSE 9 - FLAMING TUNA. GREEN MONSTER. FIESTA MAKI<br>My favorite was the flaming tuna which is a shrimp tempura roll topped with seared tuna and truffle soaked scallions so basically the pearls on steroids haha. The fiesta maki has all my favorite things: salmon, tuna, jalapeño, cilantro, avocado and masago. I enjoyed the green monster, but compared to the other rolls, it was my least favorite; the texture was too soft.<br><br>COURSE 10 - ESCOLAR. SALMON. YELLOWTAIL. TUNA<br>Each piece of sashimi I tasted was incredibly fresh; my favorites were the escolar and salmon - rich, buttery and fatty.<br><br>DESSERTS - CHOCOLATE MOUSSE & KABOCHA <br>My friends ended the meal on a sweet note with chocolate mousse with puffed rice and green tea sauce as well as charred kabocha squash which was served with ice cream. The mousse was good although there was an ingredient in it none of my friends could quite put our fingers on. I didn't try the squash, but everyone seemed to enjoy it.<br><br>EXTRAS - TORO UNI TARTARE<br>Even though I was already full, I haaad to order it! Fatty toro and buttery uni served over a bed of sushi rice with quail eggs, scallions and freshly grated wasabi. How bad could that be?! Served with nori so you can make diy rolls. Can't even put into words how good it was - truly exceptional and flavors were sublime!

I try to keep up with the foodie scene in Chicago even though I moved out to the east coast a year ago and stumbled upon Kai Zan's instagram page about a month ago. Kai Zan isn't your momma's sushi restaurant so check your expectations.. and everything you know about sushi at the door. Now step in. <br>The decor will quite literally set the tone for the rest of the night, it's dark..moody...sexy... you may blush a little when you step in even. The staff is incredibly friendly though and you'll feel at ease immediately. If you're lucky you might get seated at the bar so you can watch the magic happen, but the cozy booths lend themselves to a more intimate seating if you're there as a couple or a small group and want your privacy. <br><br>While stalking Kai Zan's instagram I basically had my heart set on trying out their Omakase menu ...but literally everything screams to be eaten and the choices are insane! how do you pick one over the other?? the Omakase is a 10 course hand selected menu by the chefs which really does introduce you to almost everything on the menu. It's special.. it truly is special. We started off with the Japanese Red Snapper wrapped around toro and topped with basil miso olive oil and tobiko... and ZOMG!!! I may have had a moment ... wink wink ....followed by more amazingness.. but my personal favorite had to be the Oyster and scallop shooters topped with ponzu sauce and fresh Uni.. how is this even real life? So glad we got 2 shooters each cuz there's no way I would have settled for just 1. I think the chef over heard me gushing about my love affair with Uni, cuz he ended up treating us to an extra course of hamachi with uni on the house.. over this amazing sweet mango sauce of some sort.. I stopped paying attention to every detail after some time.. you'll see the pictures on my IG and know what I'm talking about. <br> I just wanted to enjoy each bite and every moment. By the end of dinner we were sufficiently stuffed..split dessert between the two of us and had a couple drinks. Definitely made for a fun girl's night out and you really do need to go here with someone who appreciates sashimi in its best form. <br><br>Save this one for a special night... but make it happen soon!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "We went here for an early dinner on Saturday, and we were able to get a reservation for 4:30 at 3:45, which was very convenient. When we arrived we were seated right away and greeted with warm towels (always a nice touch). We were so hungry, we made the mistake of ordering a lot of appetizers: the calamari, the beef skewer, octopus skewer, and pork belly skewer. Then we ALSO ordered four sushi rolls: Green Monster, Flaming Tuna, Fiesta Roll, and Spicy Tuna roll. In retrospect, we would have only ordered the sushi because every roll was so delicious and fresh and unique. The skewers and the calamari were ok, but I wouldn't order them again. They are the reason I'm giving Kai Zan 4 stars instead of 5. The calamari was tough to eat. <br><br>The sushi on the other hand, was PHENOMENAL. The Fiesta roll was so fresh and full of fish, but it was so so so spicy. My favorite roll was the Green Monster, which is rolled in avocado. I can't imagine that's easy to do, but it was well worth the effort. When I return to Kai Zan it'll be for sushi only.

I do not think I've ever had such delicious combinations of sushi and it even got me to step out of my usual and try some unique courses. The sashimi was so fresh and quality, the angry crab appetizer was so good I almost ordered another.

She was great to talk to, extremely helpful, and able to answer my questions even though it was clearly quite busy! <br><br>Fast forward to last night: My husband and I ordered the omakase (basic) and some amazing wine. And wow. He and I just spent two weeks in Hawaii, eating sushi and seafood DAILY, but it did not come close to comparing to what we got here at Kai Zan. The fish is truly FRESH, which allows the full flavor profile of the chef's preparation to emerge (rather than having the sense that the flavors are covering up bad fish). My husband is a spoiled foodie, not easily impressed or excited by much of anything, and he was ecstatic by the end of the meal! He kept shaking his head in disbelief and smiling. Successful date night! <br><br>Our server, Arlene, was just perfect. She explained each course clearly and succinctly, was extremely prompt, and made sure that she attended to us without seeming imposing. The bus staff whisked away dirty plates as soon as we pushed them away from our places. It was amazing, amazing service.<br><br>We travel and eat a lot, and spend far too much money trying new restaurants. But both my husband and I agreed that this was hands down the best meal we have had in at least 3 years. We plan to come again and try the Premium omakase in the future. But even if you just come here once, get the omakase. You will not regret it. And thank you, Kai Zan, for reminding us that excellent Japanese food really is possible here in Chicago.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "If you are a true sushi lover, and know your fish and flavor combination, do yourself a favor and save your money and spend it somewhere else. I'm still pondering how this place has 4.5 stars. Honestly, I don't even know where to begin of what went wrong w/ this meal. My friend and I had a reservation, and it was fairly difficult securing a reservation, but upon arrival, there were quite a number of open tables. We both ordered the premium omakase, and by no means was cheap, even being a life long New Yorker. If I am paying $115 for sushi, it better be some damn good sushi...<br><br>First dish - tuna tartar with bunch of edible flowers and taro chips. Not impressed off the bat.<br>Second dish - potato soup with anchovies. This would've been a decent dish if the soup wasn't cold. Timing was very off all night -- most of my hot dishes were cold.<br>Third dish (chef's amuse bouche) - one piece of spicy toro...yes you heard that right - toro mixed in with spicy mayo. Should be a crime. Should never use those two words in a sentence. For all I know, it could've been salmon, or blue fin tuna - why would you mix mayo (a fatty content) with toro (a fatty fish)? Also, on top, another edible flower and a crispy kale. At this point of the meal, I'm so confused.<br>Fourth dish - Daikon wrapped in a piece of yellow tail atop of some smashed avocado, and yes garnished with ANOTHER EDIBLE FLOWER. This is probably one of the worst dishes of all. The mushy fish with the mushy avocado that is mixed with some sweet sauce and the bland flavorless daikon - very nauseating bite.<br>Fifth fish - cup that is layered with truffles, with truffle mousse on the bottom, as well as seared scallops, atop with wasabi tobiko, lemon zest, and wasabi tobiko, (and yes, some more edible flowers). They really threw the kitchen sink on this one. The most bougie looking thing I've seen. This photo instagrams and snaps well, but just a lot going on with this one. The scallops taste great on its own, but when mixing with the mousse, might be just a tad too much....and the wasabi tobiko...just a mistake. The wasbi-ness of the tobiko overpowers the entire dish. Almost seems as of they just wanted some greenness on the plate.<br>Sixth dish - Beef. This dish was actually decent, but it was cold when given to us.<br>Seventh dish - Nigiri. Toro and amberjack were fine. Lobster was garnished ontop with something that tasted like big mac sauce atop with some black tobiko and an edible flower. Not a fan what so ever. Beef sushi was fine except it was garnished with black tobiko and some other sauce...and an edible flower. If they were just focused on just created a clean bite with these fishes, it would be success, but for now these sushi were sub-par.<br>Eighth dish - salmon belly crusted with herbs. The salmon belly taste good - but all the extra garnishes threw and turned me off. Why is there a stick of scallion? Why put a lemon on the bottom of the salmon piece? Do you want us to use it? A lot of the garnishes didn't make any sense to me. Also these flowers need to go.<br>Ninth dish - crab with basil, tobiko, gooseberries, and cucumber. This dish was described as a palette cleanser. Absolutely nothing palette cleansing about this dish except the optics of the cucumber.<br>Tenth dish - sashimi course. At this point i'm to full to eat anything. They did not provide any soy sauce or wasabi for this dish...how confusing. The toro for this plate had better toro for the sushi piece served earlier.<br>Dessert - grainy sorbet with coconut jelly. Not a fan.<br><br>In summary, you are paying premium omakase to have the chefs put some edible flowers on every single one of your plate and concocting random expensive ingredients together hoping to wow their guests. Maybe the $65 omakase would be more valuable, but nonetheless I'm still very, very disappointed....", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Hot damn, this is hands down the best sushi restaurant in Chicago.  They do everything exceptionally well.  I actually can't say I have been to a better sushi restaurant in the country, and I have been to quite a few.  The only place that comes close is the original Nobu in NY, and i'd rather eat at Kai Zan any day of the week.

The cooked course, which I believe is third to last, was underwhelming at best. The last sashimi course was far from mindblowing, with thin slices of salmon, lean tuna, super white tuna and yellowtail that were not very fresh and feel like I could pay elsewhere for. <br><br>My slight disappointment may also have something to do with the fact that they have no uni that day, which we were very disappointed to learn, although we respected that the uni offerings then were not up to par and we were better off without. <br><br>This has been very good bang for buck for Omakase and great quality food all in all.

Granted, we are all sushi snobs and we usually stick to what we love which is Coast and Toro in Chicago but after all the hype and great reviews of this place, I decided to check it out. I made reservations like a few weeks in advance which apparently wasn't enough to land us the golden table. By \"golden table\" I mean those private four to six people booths. Now, those look freaking fantastic. When we came in around 8pm on a Saturday night, I kindly asked how long would the wait be for one of those fancy little private areas and the hostess up front told me about an hour. We didn't want to wait that long and just settled for our table. It wasn't too bad, by the window overlooking the bar, so we got to see all the action. I absolutely loved the decor and atmosphere here, perhaps more than Coast and Toro combined, it was sheek, but not overly done, not too loud and the wooden tables gave it that rustic feel which you don't usually get at these sushi places, it had that upscale feel without overwhelming prices. <br><br>Okay, so now onto the important stuff, the goodies. We started with the dynamite mussels and Oh em gee were those amazing. You definitely need to try those, they are a tad spicy and comes six for $12. Definitely a great start to your meal. What I didn't like is that your sushi doesn't come out all at once, it comes out as it's ready. Having said that, they mixed up a few of our rolls adding avocado instead of cucumber and forgot to bring the green monster roll for my friend. But the server made up for it later on by giving us all dessert on the house since we had to wait a little longer than most people and some of the rolls were wrong. Anyways, we got the angry crab, made with fresh tuna, spicy crab with chef's togarashi. It was delicious and also comes in a hand roll version for $9. We seriously got three of those by the end of the night. Then my husband got what I believe is the fiesta roll with plenty of fresh fish which he seemed to enjoy, don't quote me on the name though and it's not on the website. We also got a bunch of simple spicy salmon, avocado with eel rolls just to get a feel of the fish. And the fish was super fresh and tasty and the prices overall were very decent for what you get. <br><br>Like I said, although the service was a little shaky, she made up for it by the end and we got chocolate lava cake, mango pudding and green tea ice cream for the table.

I can't give it 5 stars because of the service. Our reservation was at 430 so we arrived at 420. Turns out they open at 430 so everything was locked. It was like 40 degrees and raining. I could literally see the hostesses and servers inside so I called and the girl who answered said she'd send someone out to open the door for us. But no one came until 4:31. So our meal was eaten while wet, shivering and cold. While it's not their fault it was raining, i dont understand  how a place takes a reservation but then doesn't allow for people to arrive early.

I have read so many good things about Kai Zan and couldn't wait to come here to check it out. The hubs and I had reservations last night. <br><br>In short- our pompous server tainted our experience and we felt like we got ripped off. <br><br>The deets:  After being seated for 15 minutes, our waiter finally came by to offer to open our wine. Side note- the place is so small there are 5 tables and a sushi bar. We were seated at the sushi bar and he had to walk by us at least a dozen times before acknowledging us. Anyways, 10 MINUTES LATER he still hasn't delivered our opened bottle of wine. We wanted to walk out, and would have had he not been holding captive the wine we brought. In retrospect we should have walked out and just said sayonara to the vino. <br><br>We started with the escolar pearls. They were really tasty but small for $8. Ok fine. Still feeling optimistic. We ordered the 3 of their featured sushi items. Eel wrapped in tuna, angry crab, and scallop wrapped in salmon. Each were $8. We expected them to be rolls. Instead, we discovered that they were 2 bites per order, equating to 1 bite per person. <br><br>Where we felt the most taken advantage of though was on the sashimi we ordered. They had 2 sashimi specials of fresh fish they were featuring. One was a steelhead trout, the other was toro. The other sashimi items we were going to order were $3 a piece. Of course having been tempted by the sound of the specials, we ordered 2 pieces of each. When the bill came we found out they were 3 times the price of all other sashimi- $9 a piece!! Lovely surprise when the bill came to discover that 2 bites per person cost $36. <br><br>Our server was MIA for the most part but when he was present to deliver our next dish, he couldn't be bothered. The whole experience just left a bad taste in my mouth.  <br><br>I get that the fish quality was really good, and honestly we liked everything we got. That is the only thing keeping this from being a 1 star review. But we left starving after spending $80. There are so many great, super fresh sushi joints in the city and I'm just sorry I wasted a dime at this one.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "While this was by no means a bad meal, it was disappointing in that expectations were quite lofty based on other reviews here as well as positive experiences friends passed on and even recommendations from a couple people in the industry. Having recently enjoyed the best sushi experience of my life at Kusakabe in San Francisco, my wife and I were hoping to find a venue to fall in love with in Chicago to frequent regularly. <br><br>The first annoying aspect had to do with the \"time limit\" on one's reservation. Kai Zan used to be BYOB and is a smallish venue, so I can understand the concept of a time limit to prevent people from lingering after the food is gone to finish wine - costing the restaurant revenue and delaying reservations to follow. However now that Kai Zan has a liquor license and serves wine, sake and beer this seems unnecessary. And it was complete overkill to inform me of a 90 minute time limit (for two-tops) and 120 minute limit (four for tops) when reserving online, then again via voice mail when Kai Zan called to confirm the reservation, then a third time when I called them back (as requested) to confirm I received their confirmation. Before entering I actually half expected to see a stop watch on the table counting down my allotted time. <br><br>That said the initial impression upon arrival was positive. We were dining with another couple and our friends arrived early and were immediately seated rather than made to wait for our arrival. Loved our placement as well; spacious, comfortable, aesthetically pleasing booth surrounded by three walls - almost like a mini private dining room. Our primary server, Brian, was rather friendly as well.<br><br>At Kai Zan one has the option of a la carte, a ten course Chef's Choice Omakase ($60 per/person) that involves a progression of items from the a la carte menu (dessert is optional and additional) or a premium Omakase (price varies, was $130 the night we dined - this involves a sequence of courses generally not on the a la carte menu and it is recommended to be requested in advance due to limited availability). We opted for the $60 Omakase and had our server recommend some sakes by the glass to pair (he made some nice recommendations and often brought samples to try before committing to the glass which was much appreciated). <br><br>The major disappointment involved the generally mediocre quality of the cuisine. While all but one course was fine, there were zero stand outs and lots of repetition (i.e. big eye tuna was featured in quite a few of the ten courses; a generic fish that you expect to find at an inexpensive all-you-can-eat sushi venue). There was a nice variety of presentations (i.e. rolls, sashimi, nigiri, shooters, soup, a fun course where you create a taco by wrapping tuna and seaweed into a shiso leaf etc.) but with rare exception they were no better quality wise (or just a small step up) from fare I've received at unheralded run-of-the-mill sushi joints. Often truffle oil or citrus sauces overpowered the fish and the high quality experience we were expecting was just not there. In addition to an overabundance of big eye tuna, tobiko was present as a component in nearly every course. One dish, a mushroom soup was nearly inedible; unpleasantly salty broth and a smelly, extremely fishy tasting piece of cheap tuna. The sake was definitely the biggest hit of the evening at our table with the Bride of the Fox being the consensus favorite. <br><br>In addition to the food being a let down, a couple other negatives (on top of the aforementioned annoyance regarding the time limit); at times beverage service was slow (at one point three courses came and went from the time my wife ordered a glass of sake to the time it arrived) and periodically the courses were brought in such rapid succession it resulted in feeling kind of rushed (i.e. twice new courses arrived before the previous course was consumed - and it was not attributable to us dawdling). When dropping over $100 per/person (including food/drink/tax/gratuity) I expect at least a somewhat leisurely dining experience. <br><br>I do have to give credit to Kai Zan for value; even though the food only generally ranged from OK to pretty good, we did receive a lot of courses for $60 (often with more than one distinct component per course) and I left completely full (we also ordered one supplemental roll, a Japanese Wagyu roll with freshly shaved black truffle - but nothing else extra). That said I think Kai Zan needs to either up the price of the Chef's Choice Omakase and include better variety and quality of fish or have a middle tier option between the $130 Premium and $60 Chef's Choice where without breaking the bank one can receive a meal that is clearly elevated from what is available at nearly every sushi joint in town.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Terrific food!

A few minutes later, our seats at the sushi bar were ready. They warned me when they confirmed our reservation that that is where we might end up sitting, which is fine with us - it's fun to watch the chefs, and also, it's easier to have a conversation when sitting next to your dining companion instead of across the table. <br><br>Everything we ordered came out promptly and was delicious.

Obviously, doing helps to expand the geographic reach of my blog, but it also paints a clear picture of different trends in the cuisine. Over time, I've noticed that while different cities may have a similar appetite for premium sushi restaurants, their style is far from the same. Take for example Seattle, where sustainable sushi is a key feature at Sushi Mishiko. Or in New York City, where traditional omakase (with famous sushi chefs) are what stands out at places like Ichimura or Nakazawa. Or in Miami, at Naoe (which I always find a way to sneak in to a blog post), which trumpets the fish flown in daily from Japan.<br><br>In Chicago, I made a point to visit the strongly reviewed - and recently opened - Kai Zan. The style of Kai Zan is hard to describe, but for the purposes of this blog post, we'll refer to it as \"fusion\". It's not typical asian fusion however - it marries traditional omakase (think: nigiri and fresh fish unencumbered by excessive sauces or weird pairings) with tapas style small plates. There isn't breaded chicken or the like - everything is relatively similar to how it was caught, and everything is unique. <br><br>The food is prepared strictly behind the sushi bar, where the grill and open concept kitchen meld perfectly into the sushi preparation area. The twin brothers who own the place both work behind the bar, and both try to make their presence known throughout your meal, which is what a customer always prefers from chef/owners. I tried to sample as diverse a menu as possible, while acquiescing to the server's suggestions. The maguro pearls were unique, almost like mini nigiri (pictured right). I also tried the Uni shooter, which was the only menu option that let me down on account of a bit too much citrus. <br><br>I also self-selected a \"mini-omakase\" of a variety of nigiri. The highlights were the grilled scallop and grilled hamachi (pictured on my blog), but all sushi was prepared with generous cuts of fish, expertly sliced with no \"strings\" or hanging pieces. The rice was a bit cold for my tastes, but the desired texture was still there. Then again, the fact that this was my second dinner (once again, I promise I still fit through doorways) might have mangled my thoughts towards the end of the meal.<br><br>The Atmosphere is laid back, but perfect for a romantic night out or (as I discovered) a lonely traveler. The staff is knowledgeable and more than willing to engage in conversation on sushi or anything else. Most importantly, the dishes that my server recommended hit​. Big time. <br><br>Kai Zan was recommended to me by some kind souls on Instagram. I will happily pay it forward  - this place is not only a must-visit, but will likely be on the Michelin guide's radar moving forward.

 No, of course not.  With the kind of variety Kai Zan offers, there's bound to be some items that don't agree with your personal tastes.  But every single item was prepared to perfection, presented beautifully, and only the utmost top quality ingredients were used.  We were completely and pleasantly full after the meal, no room left for anything additional.  It's the perfect amount of variety and quantity, and a tasting like this would easily be $85 at any of the other top sushi places in the city.  Trust me, if you appreciate sushi, this is the best $50 you will ever spend.  And the restaurant is BYOB so our bill was literally $50 each, plus a $5 corkage fee.  Not bad for one of the best meals I've ever had.<br><br>You won't need any soy sauce or siracha sauce with this meal.  Just sit back, order the tasting, and let the chefs dazzle you with their brilliance and creativity. <br><br>Favorites:<br>- Uni shooters and oyster shooters: Both were delicious, but I was surprised to find that I liked the uni significantly better than the oyster (and I usually love all things oyster). <br>- Escolar and maguro pearls: These were both equally delicious and just as everyone else has mentioned, easily a favorite of the night.<br>- Angry Crab: A bite of heaven and the wasabi perfectly hits you at the end.  It's like it was created in layers so you can taste each individual layer as you're chewing and each has a distinct flavor.<br>- Steelhead Trout Sashimi:  Imagine the best salmon sashimi you've ever had...and then imagine having something similar but twice as delicious.<br>- Tako: The octopus salad was served at the perfect time, the vinegar was light and refreshing to cleanse our mouths and the touch of wasabi was nice.<br>- Unagi Poppers: The jalapeno poppers were also very tasty, but I was a little confused.  They were said to have had unagi inside the jalapeno, but there was none, so I think somebody messed up there.  Either way, the panko covered jalapeno with cream cheese and eel sauce was not their most original creation of the night, but still tasty and enjoyable.<br>- Shrimp with Shitaki Mushrooms: The shrimp was good but the moist and barely cooked shitaki mushroom cap with delicious ginger dressing and other sauces was fantastic.<br>- Mussel: My memory escapes me, but we had a mussel on a shell dressed in deliciousness.  I had hoped we'd get to try the Orange Crush, but the mussel was a wonderful substitute.<br>- Sushi Roll: The sushi roll came out towards the end, as we were all discussing how there was no way we could eat any more food, so my fiance ended up eating most of this for the team.  I'm not sure what the roll was called but it was a simple roll of tuna and cucumber, salmon and a bit of spicy sauce.  It was delicious, but I could only eat one bite.<br><br>Not Our Favorites:<br>- Agedashi Tofu: The broth that the tofu was served in was downright drinkable, but the tofu itself was bland and unseasoned and a little bit boring.<br>- Enoki Bacon: I didn't try this one, but the other two said it was just ok.<br>- Grilled Yellowtail: A little bit bland and boring as well.<br>- Charred Smelt: I believe this dish was prepared to perfection and Chris seemed disappointed that we didn't enjoy it, as it's one of his favorites.  But the smelt was just a little bit too fishy for our tastes.  If you're okay with strong fish (and okay with eating whole fish, head to tail), you'll love this.<br><br>Service was prompt and friendly.  They were great about clearing dishes quickly, always explained what each dish was and recommended the best way to eat it, and did not make us feel rushed at any time.  The place is very cozy and casual and welcoming.  I can't wait to go back again.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I love everything about the place.

She was fabulous enough to email me and let me know a  8:15 pm reservation was available.  Talk about top-notch service; it really makes all the difference.<br><br>The restaurant is still tiny but I heard had expanded recently.  We got one of those prime seats right next to the bar and cooking station where the sushi twins were hard at work.  Best seats in the house!<br><br>Two words - Omakase menu.  This is a 12 course chef's tasting menu for $60/pp.  If sushi is a meaningful aspect of your foodie life, what's the point in looking elsewhere?  <br><br>Well, maybe there's just one more option.  <br><br>Allan, our server says there's a brand new tasting menu that offers a higher level of sushi experience and costs $100/person for 11 courses.  I decide to hold off on this until next time.  Let's face it; there will be a next time.  Plus, that's pretty pricey.<br><br>My husband graciously accompanied me although he doesn't eat sushi.  So, he stuck with the \"cooked\" portion of the menu.  I will normally try everything he eats but I was so mesmerized with Omakase that I paid little attention to what he got.  I know he got beef steak and really enjoyed it.<br><br>The Omakase was spectacular.  No words will truly do the menu justice.  There was fish galore.  There was carpaccio, maguro, tuna, oyster shooter with a zing that you slurp up, out of this world angry crab, more tuna, fish cloaked in avocado that literally melts in your mouth, salmon, scallops, octopus, shrimp tempura, roe toppings and an awesome soup.  There was more but I don't remember it all.  Last course was a platter of sashimi to die for.  In all, truly a roller coaster ride.  I was trying to jot down notes but couldn't keep up.  The fish was so fresh, there were many different and unique flavors, some topped with mayo and accompanied by wasabi for the kick.  Good sushi is never cheap and $60 is a great price for what you get.     <br><br>At one point my husband says - \"That's a lot of fish\".  As in - \"Are you really going to eat all that?\"  <br><br>Oh heck yah it was a decent amount of fish and I ate every single last piece.<br><br>They even serve the most wonderful version of soy sauce.  Not sure quite what's in it but I made it my mission to find enough food to soak it in.  I probably would have drank the left-over sauce if it came down to it.<br><br>The restaurant started off as just BYO but they now serve wine and sake.  They don't however advertise their drink menu as you cannot find it on their website.  The BYO option is now $15/table.  <br><br>I'm a firm believer that drinking anything but sake with sushi is a sin.  Allan's first recommendation was for us to try the \"wandering poet\" junmai ginjo and I couldn't agree more.  This happened to be the first pouring by sommelier Jill Gubesch at our Topolo dinner and is an outstanding sake.  Most of the sake is offered as 300 ml size options with around four offerings in the 720 ml size.  Sake tends to have a higher alcohol content than wine; we therefore opted for the 300 ml option.  About halfway through the meal, we went with \"bride of the fox\"; another junmai ginjo.  Spectacular and once again an incredible smooth finish that was a flawless accompany to the food.<br><br>We both wanted dessert and selected the homemade cheesecake and lava cake.  Both were delicious; portions were small which was perfect.  The lava cake was topped with sesame ice cream and was uniquely delectable, satisfying, without being extremely filling.<br><br>Even the ambiance is sheer perfection.  The restaurant is small and intimate.  It works for couples that want to hang out or friends that want to get together.  It works for date night.  It works for girls night out.  It seriously works for any occasion.  <br><br>The menu is a bit rushed but I do not hold this against the restaurant.  My preference would have been to spend double the time I was there as I like time between courses.  Their website states that parties of 2 are limited to 90 minutes of dining time as they are a small restaurant and there is high demand.  Guess I can live with that. <br><br>Hey Michelin, time to give a sushi place in Chi-Town a couple of nods.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Absolutely best sushi in Chicago!

The most delicious sushi and amazing staff!!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I'm going to keep it simple and sweet as possible if you don't want to read all of this: Kai Zan is geared towards a *very* specific sort of demographic. <br><br>Not to say that this is a bad thing, but then from what I have experienced from this first time visit today, Kai Zan has definitely pulled the \"beginner's club\" card upon my boyfriend and I as we were in the restaurant for about nearly two hours, oogling over the 10-course wonder that is the premium Omakase dinner. I feel that Kai Zan tries to live up to its expectations and the ever-tenacious repertoire of tuna-loving \"sushi freaks\" based in the West who have not even gone outside the realms of the 'gang of four': salmon, tuna, yellowtail (hamachi), and ebi (shrimp), with their names in acronym form read out as 'stye', which is probably enough clues to why I think that my visit to Kai Zan has made me feel like someone who is completely clueless and new to sushi.<br><br>Back to what I ordered: the 10-course Premium Omakase Dinner. It is advertised as having non-traditional ingredients, which looked very intriguing, as Kai Zan seems to pride itself over as having a Fusion element with their food as well. At the time my boyfriend and I ordered this, it was $130 per person. Under the assumption that Kai Zan interprets Omakase as \"up to the chef['s mood and choice]\", we were cool with everything until we realized that we're still in a sushi establishment based in the West. Our server, who I forgot the name of (I'm sorry in advance!) answered a few questions that we had as much as she could, mainly with concerns of being served rolls, wraps, and gimmicks to please the individuals who aim to eat foreign cuisines to appear more \"cultured\" or \"exotic\". Bad news was the Omakase here is very much a predetermined menu, which really made me a bit wary about what was about to come. Good news was she ensured that we wouldn't receive any of that bad stuff, which we are THANKFUL for, but then we stumbled upon the next level of how sushi culture became a realm for buzzwords and people trekking to Japan's Tsukiji Market in Tokyo just to take pictures of tuna, boasting about the price and name of the meat rather than the quality, and then leaving promptly without getting a taste.<br><br>Buzzwords. Ootoro, Chuutoro, Akami, and Wagyu are the main triggers when it comes to thinking about Japanese food. We received all of these, if not more in our dinner tonight. I'm not sad about it. I'm not mad about it either. It's just that I felt a bit underwhelmed for paying $130 to receive stuff that is of excellent quality, taste, and presentation, but not that interesting nor memorable. So much for the innovation that seemed to burst out of this place. Out of the 10 dishes we had, at least 4 of them had some sort of tuna in it. Having one sort of thing once is great. Having one sort of thing in different variables but then are tangent to each other (i.e. ootoro nigiri with pickled wasabi, then shoyu glazed chuutoro)?? No, thank you!!! Also, there was no uni in our selection. I'm a bit shocked there myself, having paid that amount and not receiving the therapeutic treatment of sea urchin, but instead having a load of fatty-cut fish served to me with no innovative palate cleanser in sight or mind to balance the elements out. It was extremely heavy on the mouth, and by extension, the soul and the stomach; contrary to the nature of enjoying sushi, sashimi and nigiri. <br><br>Sure, this would be an excellent sensory and pleasure overload to those who aren't that acquainted with the taste and art of raw fish, but then I was looking for something to remember, something unique. And that's why I decided on getting the Premium Omakase, let alone an Omakase meal. I left disappointed. I was expecting to be served stuff that will give me the chills, something that I wouldn't be able to recover from, leaving me wanting for more. I didn't feel like I got the Omakase treatment that usually entails a spur of the moment choice to go with whatever has been served to my table already, plus the requirement of ingenuity that comes with being called an 'Asian Fusion' place that would make my head, heart, and stomach race with excitement. After the 'honeymoon' period of my meal, I just felt completely empty and couldn't even recall what I have ate less than an hour ago. I would want to give Kai Zan another shot at redeeming themselves whenever I have the cash to spare, or if someone is willing to treat me there (*wink wink, nudge nudge*).<br><br>If you want a good sushi experience here, get the Omakase. If you want an even better sushi experience here, research a bit before you visit, and write down what you want to try since Kai Zan can make stuff to order, as long as its a standard sushi, sashimi, or nigiri item of course. <br><br>You played it too safe, Kai Zan.

I have had what I believe to be very good sushi, and Kai Zan is heads and shoulders above anything else I've had. <br><br>I went here with 3 other friends. We're all very into wine, so yes, many bottles were brought. I do love that they are completely BYO, and yea, we kinda abused that. Thankfully the staff was cool with it and we made sure to reward them for that. <br><br>Anyway, it's near impossible to get into all of the food. Mostly because we just let our waitress pick for us. So, food would just appear and she would tell us what we were having. I was only paying so much attention and more just focused on the killer fish in front of me. <br><br>We started off with the oyster shooters and the escolar pearls. The oyster shooters are a complete trip with them being so wrong that they are insanely right. The escolar pearls were absolutely awesome and should be ordered by everyone. <br><br>Here is where things got hazy as it was one order after the other. I do remember there being some steelhead trout sashimi that was amazing and a fiery crab (or was it angry crab?) that we had to order twice. The major point being though, everything put in front of us was both gorgeous in it's presentation and just as delicious as it looked. <br><br>Kai Zan is a very small spot. We were there for a little over an hour and we could see a line forming out the door, so we did have to leave a bit sooner than we probably would've liked.

I think we've just had better agedashi tofu elsewhere.<br><br>Jalapeno poppers:  Perfectly fried, nice combination.<br><br>Bacon wrapped enoki:  Not a huge fan... I think I was expecting the bacon to be more crisp and more texture to the enoki.<br><br>Marinated shitake:  These were awesome... so packed with flavor, I saved these as my last bite for this particular dish.<br><br>Yakitori smelt:  Tasty, good flavor, nice and smokey.  Reminded us of some filipino fish dishes in terms of preparation/smell.<br><br>Steelhead trout:  Really, this tasted like salmon.  I would have never guessed that this was trout... but then again, they are both very closely related, so I guess it makes sense.  A phenomenal sashimi.<br><br>Mango pudding:  Refreshingly light and simple, perfect way to end the meal.  Best shared with two people, though we did share with four as we had additional dessert plans afterwards.<br><br>Verdict:  Get reservations early, as this place literally will only fit 22 people or so.  Great service, phenomenal food, and you have got to make your way here to enjoy it.  The Omakase is a steal, in all our opinions, and I hope they keep it that way because it will keep us coming back for more and more.  Only disappointment for the night was Agedashi tofu... but considering the amount of courses we had, one off course is nothing in light of everything we enjoyed.  Can't wait to come back again.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Rarely do I give out five star reviews.

There vanilla ice cream and mango pudding were delicious as well. <br><br>Kai Zan provides incredibly fresh, clean, and beautifully crafted food. The portions, progression, and value of the Omakase menu are perfect. This is perhaps one of the best sushi restaurants I've ever had the pleasure of visiting. <br><br>Some final quick tips: Nevada's across the street has a great beer selection for your last minute BYOB needs, plenty of FREE parking can be found on Chicago, and biggest tip is to GET YOUR BOOTY IN HERE IMMEDIATELY!!!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Want to know the next hot sushi spot in Chicago that you won't be able to get into? Kai Zan - out in Humbolt Park on Chicago ave. Simply put, it has all the right ingredients (pun intended) to go viral and cultish. It's small (like 20 seats), awesome decor, BYO, off the beaten path, and happens to serve delicious food that's not your typical maki roll from Dominicks. And it's crazy affordable. Not much else you need to score big.<br><br>The meal started off with a bang by ordering the Escolar Pearls  (rice spheres topped with scallions and super white tuna soaked in soy sauce, truffle oil, spicy mayo, and chili oil, then lightly seared), and sides of edamame and gomae. The pearls of little rice with amazing flavors on top were so good and had four pieces for the three of us that we need another order. Easy call. Delicious. We all said we could come back for a meal entirely of Pearls (there's Maguro too, for variety).<br><br>We followed the pearls with some sushi/sashimi. I believe we ordered some hamachi sashimi (not 100% on that), the flaming tuna roll and the orange rush sushi. The sashimi was nice but a little fatty/tough for my preference. Light sauce was very nice. Loved the flaming tuna, had a lot of fun items and nice texture variety. Really nice. Finally, the orange rush gives the pearls a run for their money for favorite of the meal. It's served on a single shell, and is a one bite show. There's scallop on some rice entirely wrapped in salmon with a nice citrus glaze. Big fan, would order again and multiple. We also tried some of the yakatori to get a little variety and try the menu. We had the chicken, shrimp and beef. Everything was nice and flavorful (though I'd stick with the amazing fish), and the shrimp was the best and most interesting option (and really cool presentation). We weren't hungry for more but also wasn't completely full and wanted to extend our experience. We asked for a chef's surprise and they brought us three huge pieces of fatty salmon belly (something only offered on the tasting menu). It was really nice, definitely fatty (in a good way) and super generous portion. A great way to end the meal.<br><br>I very much look forward to getting back to try more items and some of my favorites. The BYO is just icing on the cake (liquor store across the street) and the bill was remarkable ($35/person). The space is cool, intimate and fun with great food and value.

I have to say, Kai Zan is one of the amazing ones. The place is small, only has about 12 tables so a reservations is definitely recommended unless you want to wait. We arrived for our 5:45 reservation (I swear we're not 95 years old, this is just all that was available) and were promptly seated. <br><br>They had some very reasonably prices wines, which is definitely not something that you come across often at a good restaurant. We got the DMK rose and it was about $30 if I am not mistaken. The menu was a tad overwhelming so we had Justin do a run-through with us. We ended up doing one of the chef's omakase and then putting in a few additional dishes that we wanted to try: <br><br>-Tako Yaki (4 stars): this is basically fried octopus, and its amazing. A tad spicy, not for the faint of hear, but really delicious. I'm not a huge fan of fried dishes, which is the only reason this is not getting 5 stars from me. But if you are, this is a must. <br><br>-Escolar/Maguro Peals (5 stars): The fish was amazing. And the additional of the truffle oil really only made it better. These are small, like really small. But what it lacks in size, it makes up for in flavor. <br><br>-Dynamite Mussels (4 stars): These were really great as well. I believe we were only served 2 mussels, so another small portion for the price, but amazing. <br><br>--Uni/Oyster Shooters (5 stars): These were one of my favorite dishes of the night. If you're a fan of shooters, these are some of the best I've ever had. The flavors were incredible, and they top them off with a bit of Tabasco, which, being from the South, really sealed the deal for me. <br><br>-Madai Carpaccio (4 stars): As far as flavor goes, 5 stars, but a tiny tiny portion, so I left feeling a little disappointed in that area. But if my only complaint is that there wasn't enough of it, then we're doing okay.<br><br>-Angry Crab (5 stars): absolutely my favorite dish of the night. Although it was a very small portion, it was incredible. A must order.<br><br>-Orange Rush (3 stars): this was similar to the angry crab, only this was made with salmon as opposed to tuna. The salmon had a pretty strong fish taste, so this was not my favorite dish, however my husband loved it.  <br><br>-Fiesta Maki (4.5 stars): This was one of the two rolls we were served (6 large pieces). It was part of the omakase. To start, I don't even like cilantro in my sushi, but I loved this roll. The combination of the chili oil with the jalapeno was just great and I would definitely order again. If you're looking for a simple, fresh roll, give this a shot. <br><br>-Flaming Tuna (5 stars): This was SO GOOD (8 smaller pieces). One of my favorite parts of the night. I only wish I had been hungrier, as this was the last dish brought to us. It was on the richer side, so different from the Fiesta, but it was delicious. A must order for me. <br><br>I think our total bill was about $160, without tip, if I'm correct. Possibly a little more than that, but we had a bottle of wine so it's a bit fuzzy. All in all, I think this is a good price for the quality of food we received. I would say they could increase their portion size, but other than that I have zero complaints.

I fear that it could jump the shark if it gets any more good reviews.  But, the Vizconde twins did not disappoint when I sat promptly at 5 p.m. in front of them at the sushi bar after not having eating a single thing all day in anticipation of my omakase experience.  They completely toppled my previous favorite, Coast.  Dear Coast, I've already forgotten what you look like.  <br><br>Just to give you a little perspective, I worked as a fine-dining server for 15 years in the best American and French restaurants.  I have a razor-tuned palate. When it comes to sushi, while I love it and have eaten at countless sushi bars, I'm a bit out of my element. I've  I don't know any Japanese terminology.  I only explain this to tell you that I do not lightly say this: This was not only the best sushi I've ever had.  It was the best meal I've ever experienced in Chicago in terms of the entire experience .  .  . and the value for the dollar.  I know when restaurants are screwing you over for a \"tasting menu\" and this does not happen at Kai Zan.  Now I know that their prices have risen slightly since their opening, but what I received for $60 last night was spot on.  BTW, Dear General Public: Do you know that whenever you eat out for brunch you are getting totally hosed on value for your dollar? Here the dollar sprouts little angel wings and flies further than you know it could in the overpriced universe known as Chicago.<br><br>The food, everyone else on this forum has emphasized the food in great detail.  My favorite was the Angry Crab and the Scallop \"pearls\" with truffle oil.  The dashi broth course was also excellent.  And ending with the sashimi plate instead of starting with it .  .  . absolutely genius.  After already having had around 10 courses, you realize now matter how full you are you can slide down just one more perfectly cut piece of fish.  The Dynamite Mussel was also excellent, much more flavorful than the standard French presentation of mussels & frites.  I checked with the chef and, of course, even the mussels were sourced carefully, New Zealand  green lipped as I'd suspected.  They are richer, slightly larger, fattier, and more flavorful than the standard PEI mussel that is generally served in restaurants.  If you ever have your choice at the fishmonger, buy them when you see them.  Prepare them as you normally would, but they will taste better. <br><br>Sitting at the sushi bar was a great experience and the chefs made a couple extra items in addition to the standard menu that night and handed them directly to me.  I always sit at the sushi bar so I can ask chefs to prepare me something off the menu, but these guys did it without me even having asked.  That really sealed my imminent return.  I began to wonder at one point if they suspected me of being a food writer, because I just kind of look like one and if you've read this far, you really can tell that I'm a writer, just not a food writer.  (Occasional psychology articles if you're interested.) <br><br>One food critique that I'm going to include, and only because I read many other reviews on here that mentioned it too, is the Tuna-tini.  Now, I think American brains get a bit confused some of the time because we always want our taste buds to be knocked out of the park, and an important element of Japanese cuisine is subtlety and simplicity, as in the dashi broth.  The Tuna-tini is a simple salad composed of Blue Fin toro, avocados, and heirloom tomatoes over a bed of seaweed.  The server described a dressing that was in it, but I didn't taste it.  There was nothing to highlight all of the flavors, I'm really thinking this dish is calling out for a bit more acidity to cut the fatty tuna and avocado flavors and textures. Also, as much as I love the taste of Blue Fin toro, the entire world needs to stop eating it for a few years. It's clearly listed as a fish to be avoided by the Monterey Bay guide.  <br><br>I had no problems with the service.  Many on this forum have complained of stoic or aloof service.  Dear General Populace, you are not at TGI Fridays.  The service needs to do their job not fulfill any inner-emotional vacuum that you might be having.  As long as servers make a suggestion or two, are knowledgeable about the food, are quick efficient, that's all you need.  They're not there to be your friend, they are doing their job.  Get over yourself.<br><br>Obviously, I highly recommend you patronize this establishment.  It has a nice romantic atmosphere that is not trying to hard or overdone in anyway.  They serve alcohol but I was informed on the phone I could bring a bottle of wine or sake for a corkage fee of $15/two people.  A very reasonable corkage fee if I've ever heard one.  I seized on the idea and brought a nice white wine to enjoy. My next big meal out is definitely going to be the elevated omakase, with my beautiful wife and a bottle of demi-sec champagne.  Won't that be a lovely evening?", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "came here twice and got the omakase both times. do make reservations, as it'll be nice to get a more intimate booth to add to the ambiance. the omakase price is a little steep: $60. each time, though, the thoughtfulness of the flavors and presentations of each dish were not disappointing.<br><br>my favorites from the chef's special were the pearls with truffle oil and the uni shooters. <br><br>the pearls were incredibly delectable and truffle oil sauce added such a deep richness that i loved. we have a word for such a flavor in korean, but i'm not so sure how to translate it in english. perhaps savory is the best term for it. there's a subtle spice that helps to balance out the richness.<br><br>the uni shooters were outstanding. at first gulp, you get the rich creaminess of the yolk and uni. add a little citrus tang from the ponzu. then, there's a hint of spice from the tabasco. the black roe atop most of the pieces is money. i love them. my friend wisely articulated them as \"balls of flavor\". <br><br>this is, perhaps, the best sushi experience i've ever had.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I absolutely loved Kai Zan sushi.  If you enjoy little dive type sushi bars, then you will love this place.  It certainly is not a dive.  It's clean, nice, and trendy.  I referred to it as a dive more due to it being out of the heart of the city a bit and it pretty small.  We sat at the sushi bar and what's great about that is that you get to watch the chefs all while eating.  We decided not to do the amakazi but I must say everybody else was and it looked great.

Both were rather slimy as they were topped with an egg but the flavor was unbelievable. Some of the best oysters and uni I've had.<br>- Angry Crab - This is basically a crab roll wrapped in some delicious tuna.

A small piece of tuna on a skewer is placed inside a mushroom dashi (soup) and while the tuna is still on par with all the other fish I've been eating, the dashi was the star. The dashi was packed with flavor but it wasn't heavy. It was refreshing and clean and was one of the best soups I've ever had.<br>- Shrimp, Crab Cake, Pork Belly, Octopus - I thought these were the last 4 dishes of the night but instead, they ended up being one dish. My favorite part was the pork belly. Soft, perfectly spiced but with a crispy exterior. The worst part was the greens the pork belly was placed on. Way too salty. Also the octopus was slightly too tart for my liking.<br>- Mussel - Honestly, I don't even remember it because it came with the previous dish.

People are catching on to how special this place is, which makes same day reservations nearly impossible. My advice is to order as much as you can sample, so that you know what to order more of. I'd recommend the orange rush, dynamite mussels, and the oyster shooter, just to name a few. If you're a fan of saki, they'd be happy to let you sample whatever ones you'd like.

Order the omakase tasting menu and promptly received a steady stream of well prepared sushi/fusion courses. By the 4th course we were sort of dizzy with excitement and anticipation. We were seated at the bar and in true Japanese tradition, it was cozy and occasionally kitchen-like in atmosphere. Thankfully, the service and food was similarly focused on quality. The fish was fresh for being in the midwest. There was a nice selection of shellfish too, so the omakase menu really took us through a variety of flavors and textures.<br><br>Where to begin? The pork belly with rapini was delectable. I wanted more. A lot more. The grilled smelt (nicely paired with a mushroom dashi) was that hit of fishiness that I love. You gotta eat the whole thing thing, head to tail. The red snapper with basil and olive oil was a great shout out to italian raw preparation. The truffle tuna nigiri was a subtle use of a luxury (and overpowering) ingredient. Lastly, uni shooter. Yeah, oyster shooter too but uni is my sushi kryptonite. The only time I used the soy sauce was with the maki and sashimi courses, which tells you something about how well seasoned each plate was. In fact, I could go on and describe every course mouth-watering detail but I'd like to end this review sometime in 2013. Maybe I could've loved this more if we had unagi and mackerel (aka: my other sushi kryptonites) but that's just me reaching for something negative to say. On the whole I was deeply impressed and satisfied with my meal. And so was my date.<br><br>At one point, the tea kettle they were serving from broke and tea spilled all over the place. The staff couldn't have been nicer. Several members came up to see if we were okay. Everything landed on the table. No big whoop. They even offered to replace a possibly ruined plate. It wasn't. It was delicious. But it was very indicative of how they dealt with an emergency situation, which was with total professionalism.

Places like Japonais and Roka Akor get more buzz because of the chic decor and the River North location, but Kai Zan offers up similar food at similar quality, but at a slightly lower price point.  Add in that it's BYOB and you can see why it gets the Yelp cred that it gets.  We were able to score a same night reservation around 7pm.  It sounds like they keep to a pretty tight schedule as we were informed we had a little over an hour to eat when we sat down.  That put us off a little right off the bat, but ultimately after that, they never really pushed the issue and we ate without feeling rushed or pressed.<br><br>The menu is split into cold and hot appetizers, sushi and rolls, and a few choice robata style entrees, along with a nice selection of seasonal specials.  We got a pretty wide mix of everything, although we were tempted to just go with one of the omakase choices (next time!)<br><br>We started with the angry crab roll and medium-thin sliced piece of maguro wrapped around a ball of fresh lump crab meat mixed with a spicy mayo and topped with pankos.  A solid mix and a good way to start the meal.  The tuna was more meaty and tender than fatty and melded nicely with the crab.<br><br>As someone who's always on the lookout for good fried chicken, karaage is tough to pass up.  While good, the karaage was one of the more forgettable dishes of the meal.  A bit salty on the batter and a bit overcooked.<br><br>The hamachi kama, taken from the neck/collar of the yellowtail, was the highlight of the meal.  The grilled char gave the cooked fish a nice smokey flavor and the fish itself had a nice meaty texture.  Cooked yellowtail is quite different from the raw hamachi most of us are used to and has a very fishy flavor, almost like mackerel.  The portion size was very generous for the price.  These apparently are in somewhat limited supply so if it's in stock, I highly recommend grabbing one.<br><br>Next up is the takoyaki - the skewer comes topped with just a touch of wasabi mayo, bonito flakes.  These little fried octopus balls were solid and the bonito flakes, the wasabi mayo, and the touch of teriyaki gave it a nice mix of sweet, salty, and spicy.<br><br>Feeling like we had to sample a few things from every portion of the menu, we next ordered a few pieces from the grill. First,  the slightly fatty cut of pork belly, served with a small side of kimchi, and the second, a large prawn,which was just a bit undercooked but massive in size.<br><br>To finish the meal off, we moved on to the raw fish portion of the meal.  The salmon was superbly fresh and well cut to a nice thickness, and the escolar simlarly so, although it lacked a bit of the usual crisp, moist bite that bursts when you bite into it.  We ended with a pair of raw ama ebi shrimps - fresh and sweet and followed by the meatiest, most flavorful shrimp heads I've ever had.  These almost made the meal in itself.<br><br>Thankfully, the meal didn't necessarily need the extra support from the shrimp heads.  Even before that, there was a number of dishes that put this meal into the upper echelon of Japanese meals I've had in Chicago.  I'd put the sushi just a step down from Katsu, but still better than 95% of the joints in Chicago.  And we can't wait to go back.<br><br>Pics and more up at: <br><a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fchohschow.com%2F2014%2F07%2F14%2Fkaizan&s=a693625f1dcf16df3089fb27f4efd9f226468115dd87827066155b1aed3a0f00\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">chohschow.com/2014/07/14…</a>", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Second time there.

The sushi is amazing. It's so fresh and delicious. The escolar pearls are so freaking good. We also got the fried chicken as recommended by our server, Michelle (who was awesome). It was super juicy and not something expected at a sushi place but it was a delight! As a special, there were oysters with a quail egg which were also incredible. We did get one roll which was great but definitely loved and enjoyed the fish pieces much more.  We will for sure be back to this little gem!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This place is AMAZING!!!!

I think they have a great business though, the hours are open til 11pm friday, the hostess at the door when we just 2 people, arrived at10:45 informed they where calling last call ,well we disputed the hours. We drove into humbolt park neighborhood to specifically go there, she said she will ask and they let us in, I have been dieing to go there etc..... but that entrance made for a unwelcomed vibe, we should of left! The hostess was heard telling the chief \"I told them we where closed\". Too bad to conduct business like that is terrible.  Change the hours then.  Again that hostess was rude.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "delicious, fresh, amazing, fabulous, can do no wrong.  go here for the best sushi in chicago!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The omakase menu here is easily the best, and by far the best priced sushi around. A true tasting of everything that they make, and not one of the courses was disappointing. Go with an appetite, because by the 10th course you'll be stuffed! The service is a little rushed, but I think that's because the restaurant is so small so they want to get people in and out, but that is the only negative thing I can say about the restaurant.

The service was decent, the ambiance/decor was meh, the food was just alright. We had the chef's tasting menu; everything tasted okay, but I wasn't blown away by the freshness of the fish. I felt that they were trying a little too hard to be modern and stylish, and weren't focusing enough of their attention on the fundamental aspects of the food. For example, I expect the rice to be sticky and not fall apart when I put the food between chopsticks. Little things that I would expect an apparent 4-star restaurant to get right simply weren't executed. I do not think that I'll be back.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The Omakase tasting menu is unbelievable. It's $60-$70 a person for 10-12 courses but easily worth it.  The food is creative, has a great assortment of fish throughout the meal, and each course is unique and interesting in its own way.  Our server was very knowledgeable and invested in our experience.  The restaurant itself is tucked away and a little difficult to find but beautiful inside.

I did the Omakase which overall was awesome. Started with the kumamoto shooter which was great. Then came the unagi popper which was unreal. Obviously anything fried is good, but this was even better than can be imagined (and I love eel). Following the popper was the Carpaccio japanese red snapper. The combination of the fish and oil and spices was perfect and tasty. The rest is a little bit of a blur as the items came a little too fast and started to pile up our table. We did have the biggest clam I've ever eaten. While it tasted good, it was a little too large for my friends to take. Some raw shrimp was also served up along with the fried heads which were oozing of gooey goodness. The meal ended with a couple rolls which were a little disappointing. I'm usually not a fan of the huge american sized rolls that you can barely fit in your mouth and these were almost along those lines and definitely way too much of them. One roll for the entire meal would've been nice along with a dessert. Oh well, maybe you have to specify, but since our waitress wasn't helpful at all it was hard to know what to do. Sometimes its nice to actually know what you are eating without having to ask. Add on the fact that they made us wait 30 mins for our table (which we had reserved) and then hurried us out (telling us to go to the bar across the street, which we had been told to go to previously while we waited for our reservation) the experience took a hit in the service department. But hey, no one's perfect...", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I have been to macku, arami, mirai, japonais, sea dog, coast, butterfly. Kai Zan is the best.

My one caveat to this review would be that everyone should try macku at least once.

Is it good? Sure. Exceptional it is not. Came here after seeing a mention in Chicago magazine's top new restaurants article. Got the omakase. Very much in line with other Japanese places in Chicago where everything's covered in tobiko/spicy mayo/jalapeno/ponzu or some iteration thereof. The delicate flavor of the uni/oyster in the namesake shooters were drowned in pure ponzu (yes I just drank an entire shot glass of citrusy soy sauce, must...have...water) Spicy mayo everywhere! Favorites were escolar pearls and the salmon sashimi. Perhaps Chicago is not ready for the purity of unadorned fresh fish.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "One of the best sushi Place in Chicago.  The chefs Melvin and Carlos are very creative and takes sushi to a whole new level.  If you truly want an experience just ask them to serve you their signature dishes, you will not be disappointed.  Every dish we had was fresh and absolutely delicious.  The place only seats 22 at a time so make sure you reserve early.  Definitely a must try for all you foodies!!!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Hard to find, but worth the effort.

Our waiter told us to shoot the whole thing which was way too much to take .. I did't like all the raw textures together. I ate the seafood out of the serving dish, but left the quail egg. (I couldn't eat the raw egg) and it was a pretty awkward, b/c we were sitting at the bar, right in front of the chef's (owner I believe) who make the food and they seemed unhappy they I didn't eat it. I definitely got a weird vibe from that. Overall I didn't really like sitting at the bar, I felt like I was being watched what I ate pretty closely and they weren't the friendliest guys, which is fine, but it was just a strange vibe. Our waiter was very nice, and explained everything very nicely and recommend a nice wine and sake. I really enjoyed the nigiri, very fresh and there was also a mussel dish that was delicious. The food was fresh and the restaurant cozy but I just wasn't crazy about my experience. I prefer Arami. But definitely worth a visit.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "You could definitely miss this place driving by, but well worth the effort to find it.  I am not exactly a sushi aficionado, but this was some of the best sushi I have had many years.  Go light on the soy sauce as the sushi is so good, you don't need it.

I, like everyone else recommend the chefs choice. The first time I went, one of the courses was this shooter with a egg yolk in it and I was really afraid of it, the texture mostly! Wow was I wrong, the best way I can describe it is like silk going down your throat! It is truly amazing! How anyone could give less than 5 stars is crazy to me! Seriously, someone complained about waiting 10 minutes! And others complaining about the decor or having to sit at the bar! Seriously! When you get to eat Sushi like that, who cares where you sit! Focus on the food when you are reviewing. I have to say that I am really sad that someone recommended them for Check Please. Why would you do that? It is an amazing spot, a hidden gem that should be kept special. Now you have made in even harder to get in. If I could, I would give them 10 stars! I recommend them to a lot of my clients and have only gotten rave reviews from them all. One man actually lived in Japan for 15 years and said that the food at Kai Zan was better than any he had in Japan. The twins who own Kai Zan are my hero's! Thank you guys!", "pics": null}}]}}
