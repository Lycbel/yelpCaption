These flavor notes came through, and with them they also brought undertones of toffee and specculous for strong sweet taste that satisfied but managed not to overpower for fizzle out as many hyper sweet frappuccino style drinks tend to do these days. Beyond flavor alone, the Latte was well made with an admirably accessible temperature and partially blended foam on top that showcased the advertised mousse up top but also allowed it to bleed through over time and contribute a pleasant nuttiness to the rest of the drink below.  With so many good coffee offerings in this neighborhood, it's hard to honestly attempt to give them all a fair shot.

HALFWIT COFFEE.<br><br>I first heard about Wormhole from a barista @ Gaslight Coffee Roasters in Logan Square. Don't tell anyone, but I got a decaf coffee there and loved it. Came to find out that they actually get it from here and Wormhole brews up Halfwit. Seriously, it's a mean cup of decaf. If one has to drink decaf, it should be this one. When I finally made it over to Wicker Park, I figured I'd try something new and pick up a bag of the 'Moonbat Blend.' I split the bag w/ my brother; kind of wish I didn't. I did a medium grind and cold-brewed  for 12+ hours at home. Dude, best cold-brew EVER. Flavor is rich and full-bodied. Tastes good as a traditional french press as well. If you're in town, you'd be a fool to pass this up. Head down to Wormhole in Wicker Park and pick up a bag of Halfwit coffee! It's the best.<br><br>As far as the coffeeshop experience, two thumbs up. The place is decorated with cool nerdastic gear: old video games, a macintosh, and star wars collectibles. They have bar seating with plenty of natural light--nice view of Milwaukee for people watching--outdoor seating and some couches/chairs indoors. <br><br>They have a pretty creative drink menu other than the standard lattes and macchiatos. I'm guessing it changes from time to time. My friend & I picked up a Honey Bear Latte & a 'Cool but Rude' Ginger/Curry Latte. It was the business. 'Spicy' but not played out like a chai. Nice & creamy microfoam. Generally, I have to ask places to cut out the sweetness but here I don't have to.

A wormhole is much like a tunnel with two ends, each in separate points in spacetime,\" says Sir Wikipedia. <br><br>The bleakness of October weighed down on Chicago like a ton of worms.

This was a time when Ghostbusters, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Calvin and Hobbes were popular. You could play video games with the original Nintendo on TVs with rabbit ears.

And apparently it was highly popular to eat cold cereal in public. All of this and more can be seen in a visit to the 80s. <br><br>Perhaps the most surprising thing was that somehow good coffee existed back then. Before my time warp experience I was on a Chicago caffeine crawl and this turned out to be stop the third. Somehow they managed to suck a Synesso back through their wormhole. They use Halfwit coffee. Surely that company wasn't going way back in the 80s. Which brings me to a new question. How does the coffee retain its freshness and consistency traveling back and forth through time like that? When I stepped out the door back into current time, was my pour-over which was brewed in the 80s, then 30 years old? If so, I'm happy to announce that 30 year old coffee can be amazingly delicious. <br><br>An unexpected trip to the 80s could really mess up my plans. But that was not to be so.

Overall, we felt like those there were tolerant of us, but that it wasn't a place to have a conversation. Clearly, its a great place to come to work on your laptop, read a book or just chill. The layout of where the TV is makes it hard to get to the video games as usually the couch seats are taken by someone on a laptop already.

The place was lively and more like a normal coffee house environment, the music was indie electronic fare and some 90s rock. The staff was joking with us and smiling and we could talk at a normal volume without disturbing anyone. we were able to get over to the TV this time and play some Dr Mario and TMNT on the old NES.

I don't think we have the stuff to make those..\" and \"yeah, umm all our drinks are on the menu\" So, bummed over their lack of barista basics, I went with a basic drip pour--and was not a fan of the quality or brew.  Hear me out when I say - the barista's here don't know coffee.  Unless you want one of their kitschy, sugary signature drinks, don't bother getting anything to drink here. <br><br>ATMOSPHERE:  The atmosphere here is...eclectic... but not an eclectic I could jive with. They had an interesting choice of music - too boisterous for me I couldn't study or have any kind of real conversations because I felt distracted by the blasting loud rap/pop music. <br>Also--while I would never consider myself a neat-freak, it's a dirty, grimy place. The dim lighting hides some of that though. <br><br>Overall, if you you're looking for a chill place with good coffee in Chicago--don't waste your time here.

Very nicely, I asked the barista to make my macchiato with more foam, I like foam...instead of saying, \"sure!\" She said, \"okay...just so you know, next time order a cappuccino, just for future reference.\" Now, she didn't know it but I've worked off and on in the coffee industry for seven years. So, naturally I responded, \"oh...okay. A macchiato is two shots of espresso and foam though, right?\" \"It is but we do a free pour here so. Just order a cappuccino next time.\"<br>I couldn't handle that. A sufficient, \"sure I can do that\" would have been great. So, me being me, I proceeded with, \"I guess seven years of coffee experience means nothing...\" Her response? \"No, maybe not. Starbucks?\" \"No.\"<br>So, my point here is when I ask for a macchiato, I think I know what I want, and I don't think it's the job of the barista to tell me otherwise UNLESS I'm actually wrong. What I should have told her in regards to her suggestion that I get a cappuccino, \"I don't want a cappuccino, and I don't want a cortado\". After all, if you're free pouring steamed/frothed milk, without discarding the actual liquid, you're making a cortado, and a macchiato is two shots with a dollop of foam.<br><br>--UPDATE--<br>The owner of this business and the barista I complained about responded to my review.

The guy in front of me gets his peanut butter something latte. And I wait. And then the person behind me gets their latte. And then they decide to call their coworker off of a couch in the back to start my drinks. At this point it has been about five minutes. I say about because I only decided to start a timer about three minutes in. This gentleman takes his sweet time getting everything set up. He then proceeds to make one of the two coffees. In the middle of making the first I watched him blow his nose and not wash his hands. Then he starts on the second. So the average v60 taking 3-4 minutes means on top of the initial wait I have to wait 8 minutes for my two coffees. It took so long that one of the other patrons expressed concern for my dog who was patiently waiting outside for me. I used to go to wormhole while I was in law school before their facelift. I have only been a few times since then and every experience has been the same...last time it took ~7 minutes for my friends Americano. There was one other person in the shop. He let the shot die in its cup for over a minute and then finally poured hot water on top. This is just unacceptable from a third wave coffee shop.

The chai tea I ordered was the single best chai I've ever had. And I've drunk chai in ~10 countries, on 3 continents. So....you should probably try it. Most chai teas fall into either the sweet camp OR spicy camp, disappointing those in the other camp. This one straddles the line between the two perfectly.

There is a DeLorean in the back, as you can see in the photo, as well as multiple smaller scale DeLoreans around on counters and shelves and such.  Mogwais, Smurfs(or is it Smurves?) various old-school lunchboxes transport me to a time when we didn't wear seat belts and cell phones came with it's own backpack they were so huge.  <br><br>I really like this place, I like the tea selection and the inventive coffee drinks.  The one thing I don't like?  There's an employee here who seems to either be extremely unhappy with his job or I remind him of some ghoulish figure from a nightmare of his, or maybe he hates the world?  Or maybe he's had some kind of medical mishap that froze his face expressionless save for the contemptuous look in his eyes for those damned \"paying customers\".  I honestly don't know.  He did put a pretty kick ass leaf into my Koopa Troopa though, so thanks for that.  But maybe smile a little?  Unless you physically can't, I don't think there's no reason to be a bit cheery if you work in a place that could possibly put a happy start or ending to hundreds of people's days.<br><br>So other than the coffee and tea, they do have cookies and other pastries, along with those crazily priced Macarons.  For some reason my wife loves to buy these.  I think they taste good and all and they are darned delicate, and I'm sure they're not easy to make, but I just feel a little like someones laughing when I buy a cookie the size of my thumb for a dollar or sometimes more.  <br><br>If you come here I recommend the Peanut Butter Koopa Troopa, that is, as long as you aren't allergic to nuts.  I LOVE PEANUT BUTTER, so this drink is right up my alley, and isn't too chunky with the peanut love as with other peanut butter based coffee drinks I've had at other places.  It's a little like Peanut Butter Cap'n Crunch, Cocoa Crispies and Coffee blended together.  This makes Wormhole worth the trip.  One thing I didn't agree with, the Bedrock, which is Fruity Pebble syrup with cereal milk and espresso over ice.  The drink is $3.75, and is advertised as 7 ounces,  I'm not sure if that's the actual fluid volume of the drink or if that is the size of the cup.  And it was a good drink; slight fruit sugariness with coffee, turns out to mesh pretty well.  I would just appreciate the the price lowered or the size enlarged.<br><br>So if you're in the Wicker area and are in need of a jolt of caffeine and nostalgia and a splash of Hipster angst, come on down to Wormhole.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "By far the coolest coffee shop ever.

Get it? I know. I know. If you have to explain the joke, it's not funny. <br><br>Anyhow, on with my story of writer's block.  Each November, in theory, I try to write 50,000 words as part of National Novel Writing Month.  Not surprisingly, with how bad I suck at deadlines despite starting out in college as a Journalism major, as the second week of November began, I found myself horribly behind pace.  I figured my only hope of getting back on track was to get thyself to a coffee shop (and quickly go) for the needed inspiration of others tap-tap-tapping away on keyboards!  <br><br>And this is probably the best tap-tap-tapping place I've found in Chicago. Now, it's not for the kitsch or the nostalgia. I leave those concepts up to the hipsters who frequent here typing away at art school papers and reading obscure novels (except for the $1.75 flashback cereals, I love those). For me, this place is all about the amenities. <br><br>Sure there are interesting posters of classic 1980s movies and lunch boxes up on the wall. But the plentiful power outlets that run underneath them are what sugars my (yummy, $2.50 for a large mug, peppermint herbal) tea. Sure they look a little bit sketchy, like they're from the 1980s themselves or something. But the slight potential excitement of a fire is better than having a dying laptop. <br><br>And sure there's the obligatory 1980s music playing overhead (mixed of course, since this is Wicker Park, with indie rock anthems) but, more important to me is the futuristic speed of the free wi-fi. It was so fast, that I was actually able to stream music on Rhaspody from the present day while working on a Word document and playing on Yelp (can you tell why I haven't gotten much noveling done?). In 1987 that would have seemed more mindblowingly high tech than time travelling in a Delorean. <br><br>The crowds seem to know about all of this tubularness, so it's often packed.

The coffee is really good, but smaller portion and more expensive than New Wave, I think.

I have been back a couple of times whenever I'm further down on Milwaukee away from Logan Square. The atmosphere is very hipster, which I normally like, but this was a little over the top for me. Kinda uptown hipster. <br><br>On one visit, the counter person was using an iPad to ring up my purchase. The iPad kept freezing or having some problem. Stood there for quite a while waiting on the Apple device to allow me to pay. I made some smart-aleck remark, \"If only you had a cash register, huh.\" Boy, did that get me a nasty stare down. I thought I was being very patient and as clever as I could given the circumstances. Finally paid. Looked around and noticed the customers sitting down at the tables all had shiny Apple MacBooks with the glowing Apple logo. It looked like a scene of seed pods from the remake of The Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Not quite cool enough to be the original, but the decor is definitely 80s enough to be the remake, starring Donald Sutherland in that awful perm. <br><br>The quality of coffee, and the opportunity to study Mac users in their natural habitat, I will have to give it 4 stars, but barely.

As someone raised on movies like Gremlins, Ghostbusters, and the Goonies, entering the Wormhole was an amazing experience for me. While it has already been said 100 times on here, a full-size DeLorean in the front window is hard to beat. How about the Christmas Gizmo doll on the wall? Nostalgia aside, the baristas at Wormhole brew a mean espresso. Mine was perfect...not too bitter, but not diluted either. I also enjoyed a skim mocha, which had a nice balance between the chocolate and espresso. <br><br>As for the seating area, there is kind of a weird layout. You have some long tables at the back of the store with hard chairs. Then, you have a couple of couches and soft chairs right in front of the long tables. From there, you have a large, wide-open space. Finally, there is one small table w/ a couple of chairs in the front corner of the store. I kinda like the layout, though I was fortunate enough to get that small table by the front window. Had I been forced to sit at one of the long tables in the back, my experience might have been different. <br><br>With that in mind, while the quality of coffee at Wormhole is equal to Intelligentsia, I prefer Wormhole because of the aforementioned \"blast from the past\" atmosphere that it provides. The one complaint I have (and this has nothing to do with Wormhole) is that the Wicker Park area only has a few nice blocks of shops and bars.

A \"small\" is 8oz, and a \"large\" is 12oz - the same size as a tall drink at Starbucks. And you'll pay $4.00-4.25 for that \"large\" drink. But again, the quality matters - and I have (somewhat begrudgingly) gone back again and again to drink the high-quality beverages there. So yes, it's pricey, but it's worth it, so I can't dock it any points just because I don't have the kind of income needed to spend $4 every time I get a drink.<br><br>I love the atmosphere, and with only two windows, it's a pretty dark interior, especially compared to Filter, the other neighborhood \"I'm going to sit here on my laptop and study or write a paper for the next 6 hours.\" If you're looking for a ton of coffee and food and windows to wake you up, then go to Filter.

They know everything that comes through there is top of the line, and the pride in what they are serving comes across in their demeanor. <br><br>Speaking of what they're serving, it's incredible. Just the other day I tried cascara, a tea made of unroasted coffee bean husks. I was not expecting how fantastic (and apricot-like) the tea would be. Their coffees are excellent, I appreciate the fact they're always bringing in guest beans as well. They've got some tasty vegan baked goods there as well.<br><br>And then, there's the atmosphere. You kinda can't describe Wormhole without the decor, which is full of 80s memorabilia. This can be hard to pull off, but the kicker is that Wormhole *does* pull it off.

The coffee was amazing...but the baristas made me feel unwelcome in a way that I couldn't quite figure out, so I chose to go to other places. <br><br>More recently, one of my friends started frequenting Wormhole and claimed that they had the best iced vanilla lattes he's ever had. That's quite a claim and I'm not one to rely on someone else's opinion for that. I had to verify this for myself. <br><br>So I went last week in the morning with said friend and got not only iced lattes but a blueberry muffin and a berry corn muffin. I watched the barista make the drink and honestly have never seen an iced latte made like that, with the addition of foam. I had asked for light ice and the barista explained to me that she could do that but that it wouldn't taste right because they have a specific ratio of ingredients that would be thrown off. I appreciated her taking the time to provide an explanation for why it wouldn't be a good idea. So I chose not to get the light ice then. And I am super happy that I didn't. That was one amazing latte! They really do have it down to an exact science. Not too sweet, a good amount of espresso flavor and nice and icy; perfect for enjoying on their outdoor tables in the sunshine. I also very much appreciate the use of real glasses for the iced lattes because a lot of other places give you plastic cups and don't have recycling or compost bins. As for the muffins, the blueberry was a solid blueberry muffin, not particularly special but exactly what you would want when you ask for a blueberry muffin. Yum. The berry corn muffin ended up not having any berries in it! My friend took it back inside to see what had happened and came back outside with a berry version and plate of vegan oreos! How incredibly nice!! The berry corn muffin was amazing. Simple but different enough from the usual muffins that I get that it made me want to eat more of them! When we went back in to drop off the dishes, I made sure to talk to one of the guys that had helped us with unlocking the outdoor furniture to let him that the iced latte was perfection. The staff was definitely much kinder and friendlier than I had experienced before at Wormhole.

The vanilla latte is delightful and they also have a matcha spicy some kind of tea that taste uber good, but is for dine in only.  They also sell a variety of macaroons that pair well with their latte options. <br>   My favorite part about this place is thinking about it in the context of Back to the Future 2. (This is going to sound nuts but hear me out)<br> In Back to the Future 2, Marty McFly goes to 2015 and ends up in an 80's themed cafe and his mind is blown. That is this coffee shop. If Marty McFly were to set the time machine just a few years early to lets say Nov 25th 2011 and leave Hill Valley for Chicago.

They have a nice selection of loose teas and they are served in bodum cups. There's a nice selection of treats as well. I had a couple macarons that were quite tasty. The staff is friendly and helpful unlike Filter where at around 7 pm everyone is in full get the fuck outa here mode. My Server looked kinda like Bettie Page and was very nice.

You can tell that everything there is made with care and quality. The milk is steamed as each customer orders so it's fresh and delicious. The baristas also make latte art in every drink which adds to the experience. The honey/espresso combination was DELICIOUS. I thought it would be a bit strange but the flavors complemented each other really nicely! And it was just enough drink to give me an evening zing and satisfy me. None of these 20oz monstrosities to contend with. The clientele fit right into the hipster neighborhood stereotype but it seems that people go there to meet in groups, get some work done, surf the net, maybe write some code, and it was just an overall happy place!

Implementing the sale and brew of impeccable single-origin beans of local roasters, such as Star Lounge and Metropolis, to Seattle's Victrola or San Francisco's Ritual, Wormhole goes through a delicate and extensive process of cuppings to select the beans reflecting the beauty of not only the Arabica itself, but the skill and craftsmanship of its roaster. Experimentation and creativity boom through the hands of its baristas. From this past summers 'Sexican', with agave nectar and cayenne pepper, to this months 'Winter Formal', sweet basil latte with cardamom and almond, taste buds are left with always wanting more. Fritz Pastry delights offer guests some of the tastiest 11pm snacks an overworked person could ever want; if ever-want beith the case, 'Mocha Puffs' and 'Chai-ros' will come to the rescue. <br><br> Constant friendly service of its outstanding staff and its exceptionally fast free wifi, which has a bi-weekly changing password that keeps that status forever true, Wormhole has taken their passion of coffee and people to the next level. Realizing of course that they are all still human, perhaps it is unfair to demand perfection every second. They carry with them a sense of humor and love of life that is so often forgotten.

Typically when i go into any coffee shop I get a scone, cookie, or tea cakes. I would recommend the pistachio teacakes or the amazing chocolate-pretzel cookie.

First, the good: The baristas are always very nice and the $1 macarons are good, and if you stay until close they put the unsold pastries out on the counter for free (I overheard staff telling someone else, they didn't tell me probably because by the time I left I was so cranky they didn't want me to have their freebies.) Tea and coffee are alright. And I guess the 80s-throwback decor appeals to a lot of people though it seems hopelessly kitschy and ironic in the annoying hipster way (though, if they did a whole coffee shop of 70s-era Harrison Ford posters I would not be complaining). I think the Delorean takes up a lot of space, and as the place is packed it can be a bit frustrating when a car takes a place you could be sitting. The sandwiches look stale and boring, and I had the chai cereal once which was ok but still, cereal, so therefore it pained me to spend $3 or whatever for it. My big complaint is that it's too loud here. I know, I know, I sound like such an old woman, but even in the evenings most people here are having small conversations or working on laptops, and even when I wore headphones I couldn't drown out entire albums of The Ramones or Dr Dre or whatever. All in all, due to major annoyance with this place, I'll be taking it off my list as an alternative to Filter.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "absolutely amazing coffee. i am not sure if it's the coffee they use or just how they make it, but it literally stopped and made me think about coffee in a way i don't do unless it's intelligensia. the staff is super nice (not pretentious). it's not wailing loud with obnoxious music if you want to read or work, but it's not insanely quiet either. they have a deloriean in the front window a la back to the future so on initial impression i think i thought they were trying too hard. the fact that it's in wicker park prolly added to my pre-judging, but they won me over HARD. love the comfy couches and the 2D nintendo games. can't wait to go back. they also appeared to have fairly beautiful food--small sandwiches and the like. check it out.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I really like the pour overs and coffee drinks here but I will say that one of it's downfalls is that it often does not have seats indoor or out free..it's a very popular place but it's also one of those places where people sit down for hours on one cup of coffee playing video games or with their laptops which makes it harder to meet friends there.  If you are just getting coffee to go, this is a good bet but if you want to meet someone, come at non peak hours or you'll probably be out of luck.  This place gets plus kitsch points, points for clean bathrooms, quality of music playing is somewhat spotty (sometimes I've heard The Black Angels but other times it is general 80s music like you'd hear in some of the films they have posters for on the walls.)  You can't beat a coffee shop that has a Delorean and Gremlin collectables but I do wish it was a touch larger inside and/or that people were didn't sit in their cozy spots for hours even when others were waiting.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "really nice atmosphere. busy, but not loud, dim lighting and the delorean in the window is pretty rad. the employees were really friendly and my coffee was delicious. they brew ritual beans; it was nice to have a little taste of home when i'm out of town. if you're familiar with san francisco, it's like the chicago version of sugarlump on 24th ... but BETTER.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I wish it wasn't so crowded but understand why it is!  Obviously I can't get enough of the '80s theme, which is amazing, and the coffee is delish and beautiful!  Get a latte!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "ugh. i wish this place was in logan square instead. that's how much this place is needed all over the city.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The wormhole is so cozy and comfortable and I love the staff.

I pointed out that I had already ordered and paid.
