Come here if you want creamy gnocchi, big meatballs on your spaghetti, etc. Hence, wear your leggings or be prepared to unzip your jeans. <br><br>The warm bread is refilled throughout the meal. Start with the Brussels sprouts salad, so darn good. I usually get the butternut pasta, so toasty and warm. <br><br>I also love the Owner here. My table took a while a few weeks ago after we made a reservation on Yelp, and he got my group drinks on the house. <br><br>They also clearly care about good customer service, they ask you to hand write a review every time you get your check, and just by doing so, you can start to receive LEGIT coupons in the mail from them for discounts - real discounts like $13 off your meal.

Omg both of these were so incredibly good!! They're like nothing I've ever had before! The stuffed mini pumpkin has sausage and bacon and comes with walnuts and cinnamon. The flavors of this dish blend together really nicely. The cappellacci di zucca is essentially ravioli stuffed with pumpkin and topped with butternut squash. I was fully expecting the ravioli to be in some kind of pasta sauce however it's actually completely dry. This is also incredibly delicious and worth the slightly expensive price. <br><br>Overall highly recommend Sapori Trattoria! If you're looking for a fun fall pumpkin menu this is the place for you!

It was such a sweet detail! <br><br>We started off with a bottle of wine and the burrata pugliese ($10). The Prosciutto was delicious, the mozzarella creamy, and the marinated tomatoes savory. Eric S. ordered a ceasar salad ($8) which was enough for the both of us. For our entrees, I decided on the Lasagna Di Antonio ($23). It was huge but it was so good I managed to finish all of it. It is absolutely the BEST lasagna I have ever had, ever! It had the perfect balance between cheese, sauce, and meat. Oh my goodness! I know Eric S. was rethinking his entree decision after trying it. He ordered the Pennette Cardinale ($21) which consisted of penne pasta with artichokes, chicken, shallots, and sun-dried tomatoes. I tried it and honestly wasn't too excited about it.<br><br>For dessert we went with the bread pudding ($7) and panna cotta ($7). The bread pudding was warm and sweet with a vanilla brandy sauce and raspberry puree topping. The panna cotta was decadent and creamy. We also used our check-in offer and had a free espresso and cappuccino. <br><br>All in all, it was a very nice dining experience with great service and amazing food. 100% recommended!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JwdJIZifXqFqcKzDMBrn6Q/348s.jpg", "caption": "A creamy and decadent Panna Cotta"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jCyTq5m-S3SU0mpguDDKYw/168s.jpg", "caption": "A free espresso with your Yelp check in."}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lui13Epcu-bhllZZySd43A/168s.jpg", "caption": "Warm bread pudding with raspberry sauce.

I like that there are a variety of different rooms. Our waitress was Carol and she was so friendly and helpful. I ordered a glass of rosé to start and my dining companion ordered a Moscow mule and we were both happy with our drink choices.<br><br>The bread tastes so fresh and it was warm when it came out. Also, there was grated parmesan on the table when we got there and that was a huge plus for me because I love parmesan with my extra virgin olive oil and on anything really. I could have eaten the bread all night but of course there were more delicious things to come. <br><br>We started our meal with the bruschetta after reading a lot of great things about it on Yelp. The tomatoes were very fresh and each bite was flavorful and satisfying. Next to come out was the caesar salad. It was one of the best caesar salads I have ever had, honestly. It had just the right amount of garlic, the croutons were clearly homemade. Each lettuce leaf had the right amount of dressing on it. The more I think about it the more I know that this is the best caesar salad I have ever had. <br><br>We shared the mushroom risotto for our appetizer. What I love is that the salad and risotto were both split for us in the kitchen, which I find to be very classy. The risotto was so flavorful. Each bite was bursting with flavor and I didn't want it to end. It wasn't too heavy and every bite was delicious. For dessert I got the lemon sorbetto and my dining partner got the bread pudding. Bread pudding isn't a dessert that I would usually order, but when I tried it I realized just how good it can be. It was creamy and  flavorful. The lemon sorbetto was refreshing! It was served in a frozen lemon, which I have never had before. The presentation was beautiful and the taste was just so good.

The food and drink were fantastic - there really isn't better Italian food in the city, in my opinion - this review is solely for the service we received last night. <br><br>We had a party of four adults and made a reservation for 7 pm. No problem there, we were seated almost immediately upon arriving in the backroom. Our waitress was quite young, perhaps early 20s, and she was immediately off-putting, which I've never experienced here before. She offered no greeting, no name, just immediately wanted our order within 5 seconds of us sitting down. We told her we needed a few minutes to look at the drink menu and she wandered off and came back about 20 minutes later. When we got our drinks, they were wrong, so this whole process of getting drinks took almost an hour. <br><br>From there on, we felt extremely rushed by our waitress. She was clearly trying to turn our table as fast as possible, despite the fact that our party was eating and drinking the entire time we were there (which ended up being about 1.5 hours). I know it was a Friday night and clearly very busy, but being rushed out of a restaurant is never pleasant. Our waitress was not attentive to our table at all, except when she came by to rush us out the door, and we could see her goofing off with the other restaurant staff (at one point, she actually chased one of the food runners carrying plates to the upstairs area in some sort of game of tag - extremely unprofessional). <br><br>We ordered dessert and within two seconds of our dessert being placed on the table, she literally slammed the check - that we had no asked for - down on the table. We were planning to get some coffee after our dessert, but with the check unceremoniously slammed onto our table, we decided not to. Our waitress seemed again put out when we hadn't paid the check within 5 minutes of her putting it on the table. We were still eating our dessert and finishing our wine, but since she clearly wanted to turn our table, we went ahead and put in our cards while we finished dinner.

Sapori's authentic Italian style represents many different types of cuisine, from fish, lamb, veal and chicken entrees to vegetarian and classic Italian pasta favorites with more robust/unique flavors.

If you sign up and give them your email and mailing address you will simply just get a $16 certificate on your birthday/anniversary and special coupons throughout the year (and really, no spam emails or weekly posts!)

That much is clear from just the complimentary bread: always warm, perfectly crusty, and generously portioned. You won't find the most novel dishes of the neighborhood here, or the most creatively plated ones, but you can almost certainly count on a happy, full stomach and leftovers to spare. Don't let the price of the Zuppa di Pesce upset you--it will last you 2-3 meals, and its seafood content is like a small cross section of the ocean itself.

We ordered two pasta dishes, a the gnocchi al brivido and the zuppa di pesce. The gnocchi had a perfect balance of ingredients; you could tell everything was made that day with none of the oiliness or mushiness that you may have in other iterations of the dish. The Zuppa di Pesce is a fantastic dish and a safe bet to order if you've never been there before. It's also one of their most expensive at $34, but the portion size is very large and serves minimum 2(possibly 3). It has freshly soft homemade linguine in a balanced seafood tomato broth, and is topped with generous amounts of mussels, squid, shrimp, and scallops. The pasta noodle itself was genuinely a step above; you could tell it was recently made. This, like most of their other dishes, may also be served in a half-portion($26), but you may as well just spring for the full. <br><br>While the prices per dish are a little higher than I'm used to, the quality you get for each dish is generally high enough that I'll look past that.

Some things just have to be left simple and this place does it right. <br>Lobster ravioli - mighty delicious, the pasta is filled with generous amount of lobster filling and the cream sauce is amazing. <br>Meat lasagna - presentation is very unique. It is not your traditional tall piece, but flatter and looks almost like a pie or a slice of deep dish pizza. When you cut up a piece, it is the perfect bite, not too much pasta, not too much sauce. <br>Zuppa di pesce - we ordered it \"spicy\". My husband would not stop talking about this dish for days. It is huge, 2 people can easily share this. <br>Panna cotta - the most amazing dessert in the whole world.. I want to have this 3 times a day. Smooth, cool chocolate hazelnut mousse - like cream taste like heaven. <br>Tiramisu - one of the better tiramisu I have had. <br><br>Overall, the food was fantastic, service was great.. I would definitely go back!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I've been here several times since 2011-12. It's hit or miss but mostly hit. Typically the pasta is very good.

It has seemed the cocktails aren't made by bartenders just servers usually, so unfortunately they're not very good. They don't seem to have been trained in making cocktails.

Nothing was too salty, all the flavors meshed well together and were robust. Super tasty. Even the complimentary bread was good...it was perfectly toasted on the outside and chewy on the inside. The olive oil even tasted of higher quality. Already stuffed at this point, I finished with the lemon sorbetto. Such beautiful presentation as the sorbet filled a huge frozen lemon sitting in a martini glass. The sorbet was perfectly sweet and tart with a slight creaminess to it.

Also worth mentioning is the delicious warm bread they bring out at the beginning.<br><br>The prices may seem a bit steep at first but I would argue that the portion sizes are 50-100% larger than other Italian places in the city which should be factored in to your analysis of the price.

It's very convenient for restaurants to take their time updating these, I've noticed. For what other stores/industry would this bait & switch practice be tolerated?<br>-Many menu items are different and arguably worse<br>-It's located on a crummy block of Halstead with zero curb appeal <br>-It's small interior feels cramped and is not suitable for parties over 4.  Neither is it romantically intimate<br><br>The Service?  <br>Our waitress did not serve our entrees and one person at my table didn't receive her entrée. We were told c. 10mins later that the chefs \"were just putting the finishing touches on her dish\" (by a busboy or different waiter). A really old, insulting lie. She had ordered Avocado Bruscetta for her entrée, and yet those \"touches\" took another 5-10mins for it to arrive! When it did, the crostinni was un-toasted (as depicted on their website).  The waitress never apologized. She did bring a cup of soup- with the Crostinni, not during the 15-20 mins she was sitting there with NOTHING. The soup was served with no explanation. I guess it was Sapori's attempt at an apology (Nothing like soup on a 94 degree day, BTW). In case you're wondering, the maitre'd or owner had become aware of this debacle.  No announcement that her meal or the dish would be removed from the bill, even though we were a table of six drinking wine.  Her meal was ruined as was mine.

The portion sizes were large and their pasta and sauces tasted great. We packed up our leftovers to take home, but knew that we HAD to try their tiramisu before taking off. I'm a bit of a tiramisu connoisseur myself...always searching for the perfect tiramisu. We shared an order since we were so stuffed. It was absolutely delicious! Their tiramisu has a distinct taste and you can taste the coffee in it (my favorite part). <br><br>I HIGHLY recommend this place.

Sapori doesn't have any big flashy signs or anything, if you don't notice the awning, it's quite easy to overlook, but if you overlook Sapori, you'll surely be missing out on an awesome place!<br><br>We had a reservation and were not surprised to find plenty of open tables around 8pm on a Sunday. This was nice because we were able to enjoy a fairly quiet, attentive dinner.<br><br>The inside of the restaurant is fairly small, but very chic. Works (with accompanying price tags) from local artists and photographers adorned the walls. Sapori is dimly lit, with classic paper table coverings, and seating so close you're liable to make a new friend or two on a busy night. Furthermore, Sapori is probably not the place to spontaneously bring the loud, 20 person family for Uncle Guido's 55th birthday. It is the place, however, to bring your dashing significant other for an intimate date night. I would imagine that it gets quite crowded on any given Friday or Saturday, and a reservation would almost be necessary at such a time.<br><br>We started with a couple of appetizers. First was the fried calamari, and second was the burrata. The calamari was good, nicely breaded with a great red sauce to go with it. The burrata was amazing. The flavors and texture of the crunchy bread, creamy fresh mozzarella cheese, thick cut prosciutto and tomato were absolutely fantastic.<br><br>We did get a couple of drinks too. I opted for the Giancarlo Chianti which wasn't bad, but perhaps a little underwhelming at $8/glass. Decent sized pour, though. Another friend went with the servers recommendation of a French martini. I mooched a sip and holy cow, this was one quality cocktail! It was quite strong but so expertly mixed that the fruity flavors overshadowed the alcohol taste.<br><br>We were warned about Sapori's traditional-sized portions and even after we ate our share of appetizers and bread (with oil of noteworthy quality), we still opted for one entrée each.<br><br>Everyone thought their dishes were delicious. One friend had the buccatini carbonara, one the pennette cardinale, the other the cappellacci all' aragosta, and myself the gnocchi al brivido. We all insisted on trying each others' food and there wasn't any dishes the four of us disliked. I can especially comment on the cappellacci aragosta, which was most similar to a lobster ravioli. This was out of this world and probably would be my go-to item here. The pasta was done right and the lobster was so fresh and flavorful it literally melted in your mouth. The sauce was both creamy and a little acidic. I also speculate that some type of seafood stock was part of the recipe. It had a subtle fishy taste to it, but the good kind of fishy that complements the whole dish. My gnocchi was also quite tasty. I'd consider myself a pesto freak, and while this pesto was more of an oil-based sauce and not a cream sauce, it was exceptionally flavorful and matched perfectly with the thick gnocchi, yummy dried tomatoes, and hearty chicken chunks. The unanimous decision was that the cappellacci was the best of all the plates, though.<br><br>Peter was our server and he was very good and quite knowledgeable. He was calm, cool and collective but definitely made some quality recommendations, helped us with pronouncing menu items, as well as threw in some grin-worthy comments here and there. Service was spot-on.<br><br>I would really be nit-picking the finest of details if I were to report anything negative about our experience here. While Sapori is a little pricey, the quality of food here (made-in-house noodles and sauces, for example), the location, and the experience is definitely worth it. Not to mention, we had a considerable discount due to the Groupon we used. <br><br>Overall I really enjoyed our experience at Sapori Trattoria. I would summarize it as being more of an intimate, authentic and boutique Italian restaurant. Take advantage of the deals they offer on Yelp and Groupon and your experience is sure to be as good as ours was.<br><br>Excellent!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/L8swLGgTr5gJcElyD9BuWw/348s.jpg", "caption": "Gnocchi pesto"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Here's how you spell good food....S-A-P-O-R-I T-R-A-T-T-O-R-I-A. Okay, well maybe not exactly but pretty darn close!!!!!<br><br>Seriously, I don't want you to ever set foot into another Italian restaurant unless it's Sappori Trattoria. I'm not asking, I'm telling you, if you want Italian, I normally would send you to Club Lago in Chicago but if you're not quite that far into the city, then this is your place!!!!! <br><br>After my husband took me for my Christmas gift to see Blue Man Group for the first time just down the street, we knew we were going to grab dinner in the area afterward and he wanted Italian so I pulled up my trusty Yelp app (insert advertising for Yelp's trusty app here) and found two places that caught my eye. This one was 3 minutes away and had like 1500+ reviews with 4.5 stars, I had to go with the majority on this. For that many reviews and to still have 4.5 stars with the world today being nothing but critics, I had to try this out for myself. We pulled a U-ey and off we went. Found a parking spot on the side street running adjacent to the building just a short walk down the street. <br><br>I actually called first to see if there was a wait and to my surprise on this Sunday evening, the gal told me there was no wait and to head on over. Her words, not mine. I loved it! She basically made me feel like I was being invited over which made the visit all that more exciting. <br><br>When we arrived I found the cozy entrance very well maintained with a heater in the corridor and my hubby and I waited patiently to be able to walk in behind the groups ahead of us. We asked for a table for 2 and the lovely hostess walked us upstairs to a second floor dining room. Tons more seating, a few restrooms and a nice view down Halstead. There was a sign at the entrance that said to please excuse their mess as they are remodeling but I thought the establishment looked great! Super cozy, clean, and it looked like a fresh coat of paint on the walls upstairs. It's amazing what a fresh coat of paint can do to a place. Really looked nice. <br><br>We were seated at a small table for two which I wasn't surprised being dinner time in the city. I figured we would feel crowded at our small table but it turned out to be perfect. It kept us intimate and really made it nice for conversation with each other and a sweet little date night with my favorite guy. <br><br>We were smart and although we totally wanted to app it up, we skipped and dove head first into our main dishes. My husband ordered their shrimp pasta and I, their lasagna. I hadn't had lasagna in a really long time and it just sounded good. When our server informed me it was an individually made lasagnas, I knew it would be perfect. Little did I know it was going to be enormous!!! I swear it was literally like 7\" x 7\" on a platter. Besides being huge, it was SOOOOOOOOOO DELICIOUS. I could not believe it! It was like I was eating Grandpa's lasagna all over again. My husband offered me a bite of his shrimp pasta and I decided to taste it. It wasn't my thing but then again, I'm not big on warm shrimp dishes. I prefer my shrimp cold but my husband absolutely loved it. We each had two additional meals worth of leftovers to take home and I tell ya what...my lasagna was even better on day number two and three. <br><br>We will be back soon, for sure!!!

That alone just floored me!!!<br><br>I went on a Monday night with a friend and we were surprised to learn that Monday nights for $20 a person you get a four course, family style meal. It was such an unbelievable value. Between the two of us, we had leftovers for days. The food was really excellent too and you were not limited in choices for the $20 special. We were even able to order lobster ravioli that was by far our favorite of all the yummy dishes. Our server was extremely friendly (my friend felt he might have been a little too friendly, but who am I to resist the flattery?!).<br><br>Our friends were even so impressed with the staff; service, wine selection, and food that they've decided to have their wedding reception here in May so I can't wait to see how this restaurant manages to blow me away in this capacity.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Okay so no wonder this is rated one of the best and most reviewed Italian restaurant in Chicago, it definitely has its merit and we definitely enjoyed a nice Saturday evening with another couple here as well. The atmosphere is very nice and they have two floors and can accommodate you on a date night or if you come here with a large party for a big birthday bash. There were four of us there and we got a nice quaint table upstairs by a window and I almost felt like I was in a little Italian village enjoying some comfort Italian food. <br><br>Now onto the important stuff, the Italian goods. We decided to share the fried calamari and it was tasty but a little on the harder side so I would have preferred it to be softer but honestly, most calamari is pretty edible, it's fried after all. After seeing all the reviews, I know that the lobster ravioli was a must item to order here so that is one of the three pasta dishes that we ended up sharing. It was seriously divine, I wanted to lick the entire plate of that yummy orange sauce. I mean they didn't skimp out on their lobster and I would absolutely come back here just for this lobster ravioli as it's the best one I may have ever had anywhere. Then we ordered the gamberoni e broccoli dish which is a a seafood linguini essentially with two giant shrimp and tons of fresh veggies in this yummy and simple sauce. The pasta may have been my favorite of the night as I could not stop getting it so if you want one unique dish here, I would absolutely get that. We also tried the gnocchi with the basil pine nut pesto sauce and it was a little too green for me like not sure if they over did it with the pesto or basil, but it almost lacked actual pasta flavor as the flavors were a little over done for me so I would not order this particular dish in the future. So I had to save room for my capuccino (pretending I was in Florence) and the hazelnut pana cotta with chocolate sauce. The dessert was definitely tasty but not the best thing I've ever had as I'm not the biggest fan of the jello like texture of panna cotta as I'm more of a creme brulee kind of girl if you know what I mean. <br><br>Overall, we had a fantastic night and I will definitely be back. Our server was nice, kind of rushed us in the beginning but overall turned out to be nice.

It also gave us time to reflect on the first course which has not impressed any of us. After about 45 minutes the main course arrives. Except half of it is the wrong order. Lots of apologies and half of the table gets to eat some mediocre overpriced food while the rest of us are waiting. Another 20 minutes and the rest of the food arrives.

He claimed the lasagna was worth making a trip for, and I'm glad to say he was right. My friend got the lasagna since I'm not really a big lasagna fan, and we both agreed it was probably the best lasagna either of us have ever tried. I got the lobster pasta, which came in a delicious cream sauce. It was good enough that my friend kept sneaking little tastes of sauce off my plate the entire meal. My other friend got the seafood pasta, which he asked to be made spicy. It wasn't actually spicy, but still very well executed. The grilled calamari was good enough that my friend wanted to order a second one after finishing the first one. Good thing we stopped him because the portion sizes were generous for our entrees and we probably wouldn't have finished it. I normally never choose tiramisu, but we decided to split one between the three of us for dessert.

It was my wife's birthday, so we made an online reservation at the highest reviewed Italian place around, Sapori Trattoria, including a note that it was her birthday. As luck would have it, there was also a Groupon for $40 worth of food for $20, which we purchased, but the Groupon had to be mentioned at the time of reservation, so I called and asked if I could modify my reservation and they told me no problem, just to mention the Groupon to our server when we were seated.<br><br>2. We arrive to the restaurant and are seated in a back room with four tables in it, one of the other tables occupied. As soon as we are seated we noticed that we were given special menus that actually acknowledged we were there for a birthday. Nice touch! <br><br>3. Our server arrives and tells us bread and water are on the way. I mention the Groupon and am told that will be no problem.  <br><br>4. The table next to ours has two older gentlemen seated. The other table in the room then has a couple seated, and I overhear that they too are using the Groupon. We have not been visited by our server after ~10 minutes of waiting.<br><br>5. Our server takes our drink orders and our water comes out with some parmesan cheese for the bread, but our bread has not been delivered. <br><br>6. The gentlemen at the table next to ours receive bread as do the other couple seated after us. We politely ask if we could get some bread and order the grilled calamari appetizer.<br><br>7. Our drinks come out, and after a few sips, and still no bread, we ask if we can get some bread.<br><br>8. We order our entrees and eat the appetizer that has been delivered. We also notice the gentlemen at the table next to us have a second loaf of bread delivered to their table, while we still have not had any bread so we ask again if we could have some.<br><br>9. Our entrees are delivered and we begin eating them, still no bread. Our server comes out to check how our meal is and we ask for some wine and if we could please get our first loaf of bread at which point they apologize saying an oven is out of order so they can't keep up with the bread (this despite both tables in the same room seated after us having received at least one loaf of bread). We receive bread halfway through our entrees, and our wine is delivered immediately.<br><br>10. The manager comes into the room to confirm the Groupon code of the other couple while we finish up our meal. <br><br>11. We are offered a dessert menu, but decide to pass on dessert. The bill comes out and I hand the server my card. When the receipt comes back, I notice that the Groupon discount has not been applied to our dinner. We call the server over and remind her that we have the Groupon, and mentioned it at the outset of our meal. They apologize and call the manager over to confirm our Groupon. The manager asks how our meal was and we share that the bread issue was a problem, to which the manager responds that a bread oven is down so they can't keep up with demand and asks if we would like to take any bread home with us. We reply that everyone else in the room received bread well before us and decline the offer to take any home. While my card is reran, the manager gives us each a glass of complimentary Moscato which we decide not to drink as we already had two drinks over the course of our meal.<br><br>That is the record of events as it happened, and while it may seem a bit extreme to give such a low score over a simple loaf of bread, I make these observations:<br><br>- They took the time to acknowledge it was my wife's birthday, and then proceeded to not pay attention to us, not attend to our polite requests and at the end of the meal when we expressed our dissatisfaction, they just gave us what they thought we wanted rather than asking us how they could make it up to us resulting in two wasted glasses of Moscato.<br><br>- They told us there was a shortage of bread, even though both tables that were seated after us, and directly next to us with the same server, received one or two loaves of bread before we got any. <br><br>- I called to confirm the use of my Groupon and was told all I had to do was mention it to my server when seated, which I did, and was assured at that point it would be no problem. Then, the Groupon was only applied after I double-checked the bill and made a third request that it be attached to our bill. <br><br>The first observation reflects poor service, while the latter two represent dishonesty.  Was it because we were using a Groupon?

(e.g. the plating was ordinary and bruschetta bread cold, tough and chewy).  The Minestrone Soup was excellent. <br><br>The cozy back and side nooks are quieter than the main front room which has an energetic buzz so pick your table accordingly.<br><br>Good solid place!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I've had the pleasure of eating at Sapori Trattoria on a few different occasions and I can honestly say that it's my favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago. To start, the atmosphere is outstanding. It has a great home-like feel that you would come to expect from a traditional Italian restaurant. The service is great and Chef Anthony is very attentive, but the food is the real reason this place is the best in the city. <br><br>If you're a salad fan, consider the Insalata Stella, which features greens, endive, apples, and pine nuts with a raspberry vinaigrette. The sweetness of the dressing and the apples goes perfectly with the bitter taste of the endive and the earthiness of the pine nuts. If you're looking for a salad that has a bit more richness, go for the Insalata Brustica: crispy raw brussel sprouts, pancetta, dried cranberries, and an incredible avocado buttermilk dressing<br><br>Moving to the main courses, the homemade pasta here is fantastic. The sauce in the Pennette Cardinale, a white wine tomato cream sauce, has a lot of depth and richness. The acidity of the artichokes and cherry tomatoes help balance the dish and bring it all together. The Pollo Ternana (chicken breast is stuffed with smoked provolone, basil, mushrooms, asparagus, sun dried tomatoes and pine nuts) is one of my favorite chicken dishes, period. <br><br>For red meat, look no further than the Vitello Ossobuco, which consists of veal shank that falls right off the bone and is topped with a bold red sauce. In case that isn't enough, it's served over a piece of delicious meat lasagna. Don't forget to spoon out some of the tasty bone marrow from the shank, it gives it the fatty, rich flare that puts this dish over the top. If you aren't a veal fan, go for the lamb chops. Simply put, they're perfect.<br><br>At the end of your meal don't hesitate to write your feedback on the cards your server gives you, Chef Anthony reads and responds to every note and sometimes even sends a gift certificate your way. The attention to detail at Sapori sets it apart. In a city with some great Italian restaurants, this place ranks #1.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I cannot say enough great things about this place!

We ordered a bottle of wine and started making decisions as we had to share a salad, an appetizer, and a dessert, with our entrees being our own. <br><br>For our appetizer, we went for the grilled calamari and it came out as a very large portion of tentacles with peppers in a nice balsamic sauce. Cleaned the plate. We chose the Stella for our salad and were pleased when it came out on two separate plates. That always makes sharing easier. And with the size of the halved portions, this could easily make for a nice entree salad. Light and fruity, we enjoyed it. For my entree I chose the cheese-stuffed veal scallopini and it was just ok. I probably would have been happier with a pasta choice, but I wanted to try something different. For the amount of food on this plate, the price of $27 was pretty high. The best part of the meal was the hazelnut panna cotta. As full as we were, we were fighting over the last bite.<br><br>Even though I used a groupon, with the wine, I still paid dearly for my dear friend's birthday so I didn't feel like I was being cheap at all.

I have so many reasons why 5 stars is appropriate here, so let me begin...<br><br>I made reservations a couple days before through Open-table for a Friday night for 6 people with absolutely no problems. They called to confirm that night and asked if we are celebrating a special occasion and I told them that it was my sister's birthday (they asked for her name). <br><br>When we got to the table, all the menu's had \"Sapori Trattoria Wishes Julia a Happy Birthday\" - how sweet is that?! I actually knew they did it, but everyone else was pleasantly surprised. Our server was great - incredibly attentive and I have no issues with anything. The only complaint I have is that the entire dinner took way too long, but no one was in a hurry, so it ended up being OK. He took our drinks/appetizers right away, but did not ask what we wanted for our entrees until after we were done with the apps. He could have asked earlier, but it's OK.<br><br>He brought us incredibly fresh bread (probably right out of the oven) to the table a couple of times, and we ended up all stuffing ourselves with it. We also ordered fried calamari and a dish called Crostini Di Avocado - it's very similar to what a bruschetta is, but it was way better and topped with a delicious, creamy avocado. <br><br>For dinner, I had the Vitello Portafoglio - a Veal dish with fresh mozzarella, provolone, Parmesan and basil sauteed in a veal reduction herb sauce sun-dried tomatoes - oh my God, it was so amazing I almost finished the entire entree though I was so full. My sister had the Chilean Sea Bass - I tried a piece and I must say that it was probably the softest, melts in your mouth fish I've ever had - amazing! <br><br>Besides the outstanding food and service, we were allowed three free cappuccinos with a Yelp check-in. He said it's usually only one per customer per table, but he allowed it any way. We had two tiramisu's for dessert (one with candles) and at the end, he brought us all glasses of bubbly which was a great surprise. <br><br>I definitely recommend this place for a celebration because they go all out to make you feel special.

Italian bread was exactly how it should be served, warm with a hard crust and soft middle. Grilled calamari is an appetizer that you need to try. Calamari was grilled and served in a creamy balsamic sauce with roasted red peppers. The calamari was tender and delicious. I ordered the Chilean sea bass, which was pan seared and served on top of sauted spinach. The fish was tender and fresh. I tried my boyfriend's lamp chop cooked medium rare. They serve a full rack and believe me that you will devour the entire plate! We tried the bread pudding, chocolate hazelnut panna cotta, chocolate raspberry cake and tiramisu.  All were great, but the two that are worthy of a repeat are the bread pudding and panna cotta.

I would say around 10-15 people when we arrived. Their reservation system for Yelp, OpenTable, etc. was down, so like half of the people arriving for dinner \"with reservations\" didn't actually have reservations with the restaurant. The hostesses were kind, accommodating, calm and handled their shit like total bosses. The hostess, who was maybe 19 or so, calmly took our names and let us know it would be a little bit of a wait. I was expecting her to say like 30 minutes or an hour (which is not unheard of and would've been tolerable) but then she says 10 to 15 minutes. I'm just like oh my goodness that's not even a wait compared to most restaurants. We waited probably less than the quoted time and enjoyed a WONDERFUL evening. The team continued their impeccable service as we watched them handle the stream of patrons with no fuss or issue. You could tell they were a little stressed and are typically highly organized with their reservations and seatings, but only when they thought the patrons weren't looking :) They efficiently sat all the groups waiting, coming in, etc. throughout our dinner. We never saw any other groups wait too long or have any issues, all thanks to their team's calm, cool, collected outlook and ability to run their operation efficiently. Our waitress was an absolute doll, the busser was SUPER efficient and kept my water full after almost every sip, and of course, the food was DELICIOUS. I had the lobster \"ravioli\" everyone raves about on on here and it totally earned all those kudos. The raviolis are obviously house-made pasta cut and hand stuffed. Impeccable. And huge HUGE portions. My dish was $22 and I probably could've made 3 meals out of it. But, it was delicious so I just have leftovers for 1 meal.

front on Halsted for free, which was nice.<br><br>We were seated in a small dining room off the main dining area.  The section had room for four parties of two and one party of four.  It was secluded and somewhat quiet, which was what I specified.  However, you could hear the hustle and bustle of the goings-on in the kitchen.  Nevertheless, it did not distract us from conversing with each other.<br><br>We were given paper menus that wished us a happy ten year anniversary.  We got to keep those after the meal to commemorate the experience.  That was definitely a nice touch.<br><br>We were served with complimentary bread shortly after sitting down.  Our first interaction with our waitress was somewhat awkward since we didn't order drinks right away since we were perusing the extensive wine list.  We put in our order our appetizer first before we placed our wine order.  This had no bearing on her service.  It was just weird she didn't ask again if we wanted something to drink.<br><br>The Groupon voucher was $47 to be used toward an appetizer, a salad, two entrees and a dessert.  We ordered the fried calamari and Caesar salad to start.  We didn't want to get stuffed so we asked one of the busboys if he could wrap up the rest of the calamari.  He obliged without giving us weird looks about it.<br><br>The calamari was perfectly fried and was served with an ample amount of red sauce.  Our Caesar salad tasted good, but definitely was a safe and boring choice.  The Caprese intrigued me, but my fiancé despises slice tomatoes so that was a no go.<br><br>For our entrees, I ordered the Cappellacci di Zucca, which was pasta stuffed with pumpkin in a burnt butter sauce with butternut squash, sage and pine nuts.  It came with 5 or 6 large pastas shaped like ravioli.  I have never had a pasta dish this unique.  It almost tasted like dessert due to the butter and pumpkin elements of the dish.  It definitely was sweet.  The pine nuts added a nice crunch and bitterness, which helped cut some of the sweetness.  I'm not a huge fan of cooked greens so I avoided the sage.<br><br>My fiancé ordered the Zuppa di Pesce, which was fresh seafood including mussels, clams, scallops, shrimp, calamari, and salmon in a light red sauce over linguini.  You could order it spicy, but he chose to try it as it.  It was served in a huge casserole dish.  He enjoyed it and had plenty of leftovers.<br><br>For dessert, we tried the chocolate-hazelnut panna cotta, which was on the house.  And, thank goodness it was.  I can safely say that I've met another dessert that I really did not enjoy.  I'm not sure if it was because it was suspended cream.  It had similar qualities to Jello and flan, but was just so weird.  It wasn't particularly light or airy either.  I liken it to pudding, I guess.  We both struggled through it, but eventually finished it.  I definitely think I'll order a different dessert next time.<br><br>As for our server, she was very sweet, courteous and friendly.  She congratulated us several times on our anniversary.  In fact, she was shocked that we had been together that long since we both look young.  I clarified that it was 10 years of dating and not marriage.  I also told her that we just got engaged last year.<br><br>Overall, my fiancé and I had a very enjoyable evening.  We signed up to get information about the restaurant's

The service is undeniably friendly, everyone from the host to the bussers to the servers are all welcoming and accommodating. And of course, the food is pretty spectacular too.<br><br>Some menu highlights:<br><br>Martini al fresco:- Effen cucumber vodka, fresh lime juice, St Germain, prosecco and garnished with fresh cucumber. I am a sucker for cucumber cocktails and this one had my name all over it. Deliciously refreshing.<br><br>Calamari: I've tried both their fried and grilled versions and both are ridiculously good. I am a happy camper anytime I see grilled calamari on a menu since most places only offer fried. The grilled is lightly charred and smokey and the fried is tender, not greasy, and a squeeze of lemon is all it needs. I don't even bother with the marinara sauce it's served with; it simply doesn't need it.<br><br>Avocado crostini: a great twist on standard bruschetta. Fresh, ripe, diced avocado with parmesan and provolone cheeses, chopped tomatoes, and a touch of citrus on crusty bread. So decadent and rich. Great starter to share when paired with the calamari.<br><br>Risotto ai funghi: I didn't love the texture as it wasn't very creamy, but the flavor was good. To be fair, good risotto is quite hard to master, but I'd probably skip this in the future.<br><br>Pastas: I've had the pumpkin ravioli, which comes with the classic components of brown butter sauce, sage, and pine nuts and it's pretty terrific. Last night I was in the mood for eggplant parmesan but was dismayed to not find it on the menu. Our adorable server, Benji, assured me it would be no problem for the kitchen to make it for me. I am so grateful they did, because it was fantastic. My friend ordered the vegetable lasagna and couldn't stop raving about it.<br><br>Dessert: I'm generally too stuffed to order dessert so the only thing I've had is their lemon sorbetto, which is served in a frozen lemon shell. I love when places do that.<br><br>As I mentioned before, the service is stellar. Menu recommendations are spot-on and they always aim to please. I often receive coupons in the mail that save money (usually it's in the form of a $14 gift certificate), and I welcome anytime I can save some dough. In my opinion prices for pasta dishes (without any protein) are a couple of dollars higher than they should be ($20 for eggplant parmesan and vegetable lasagna seems a little spendy), but the prices are offset by the plentiful discounts they frequently offer, so I guess it evens out.<br><br>Parking in the area isn't too difficult on weeknights, but I'd imagine it's problematic on the weekends...but they now allow you to park for two hours in the Home Depot lot just down the block, so be sure and take advantage.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I went here with a friend for dinner and the food was really good.  I was impressed with the service as well.  Any place that makes there own pasta gets two thumbs up from me.<br><br>We started with the burrata plate with prosciutto there were seasoned tomatoes and basil.  So yummy.  I had an amazing pasta.  The wine choices were nice and were not overpriced at all.<br><br>I will be back for sure to try some other of there yummy pasta.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "You want Italian?

It was so cool they printed my husbands name on the paper menu: \" Sapora Trattoria wishes FAISAL a Happy Birthday\" <br><br>Have to agree with some other yelpers it does get kind of loud, we were next to a party of 30 young adults, so you can imagine. Luckily, we were watching a performance at Stenphen Wolf so we didn't get to the restaurant till 10 pm. The group left shortly after we were seated and than it was just me and my babe.<br><br>The waitstaff was nice and attentive, we told  them we had a Groupon and unlike some of the other rude places who go all cray cray when they find out you have a groupon, our waiter gave us a smile of assurance and said he will take care of it towards the end. I also got an offer for free Cappuccino as I checked in on yelp and they were nice about it.<br><br>We skipped appetizers and jumped straight into ordering our main dishes. Food was great, Rissotto Pescatore had a nice spicy kick to it, it included mussels, scallops, calamari, shrimp, and Clams. Huge portions, I just finished the other half of my entree for lunch today. Dear Hubby ordered some kind of lamp shank and according to him the flavors were nice and bold, I had a piece of the grilled potatoes drenched in some kind of sauce from his plate and  it was pretty good.<br><br>We ordered Tiramisu for desert and it didn't show up on the bill. YES! it was on the house, how awesome is that? So we not only paid half for the food through groupon but also got free Cappuccino, and Tiramisu.

First off, it took my husband and me two trains to get here and it was well worth the ride. I made our reservations via Open Table and made a specific request for a corner booth/table that is a little quiet. We arrived about 18 minutes early to which they told us that they were working on my request. Once 8pm arrived (our reservation time) the front of the house manager came to us and said that he didn't want us to wait any longer for \"that table\" that he had in mind. It was refreshing that for once a restaurant actually read my Open Table request.  Nicely done.<br><br>The restaurant was larger than we expected. Two rooms with tables stacked. We sat in the back room at a two-top against the wall. Nice ambiance. Perfect place for a nice date night except for one thing - ITS LOUD! This was our first time here so maybe it was more of the people sitting around us, but at times during the beginning of our dining experience, we were almost in a yelling match trying to hear each other.

Very attentive yet not overcrowding.<br><br>THE FOOD:<br>Simply delicious. Matt our server said that their motto is Quality AND Quantity. He was absolutely right.

Even though she'd never been, she agreed and we made a reservation for 7:00pm on a Wednesday. Now, keep in mind, we were 9 twenty something girls all there for a celebration. Not only was our waiter, Matt, friendly and accommodating, he immediately told us he could split bills and food/drinks items whichever way was easiest for us and that theme continued with the rest of the evening. <br><br>Since the pasta dishes are a bit larger, a lot of us split them. We shared bottles of wine and split appetizers as well. To top it all off, they specially printed my friend's name on the paper menus for our table: \"Sapori Trattoria wishes Simone a Happy Birthday!\" AND gave us four free desserts to share! (again, very good sized portions).<br><br>I say all this because I think it's virtually unheard of at most restaurants nowadays. The norm now, it seems, is having a waiter that cringes at the thought of a large party, whines that they can't split the check or accept more than 1-2 credit cards, and replies, \"we have a selection of desserts available for purchase\" when asking if they do anything special for birthdays. It's a birthday.

Our server, Matt, was extremely friendly and we never felt nagged or forgotten, despite the crowd. <br><br>The food itself was fantastic. My first test of any Italian restaurant is the quality of the bread and this did not disappoint. The menu was slightly different than what is posted online (based on specials, etc.) and though it was relatively short, there were still a variety of dishes I had trouble deciding between. I ended up going with the Rabbit Ravioli, while my date had a calamari gnocchi with squid ink. Both dishes were fantastic and the sauces were subtle but flavorful. The food was well-priced for the quality and quantity and the portions were definitely filling. For dessert, I went with Matt's recommendation of the chocolate-hazelnut panna cotta and it was quite literally the best panna cotta I've had. <br><br>Overall, the food was delicious, the ambience welcoming, and the service friendly - all in all, worth posting my first Yelp review for!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Only great things to say about this restaurant. <br>First of all, checking in on Yelp got me a free cappuccino, and I used the $15 for 30 that popped up on the app, which was great. <br><br>Matt was our server and he was extremely helpful and friendly. <br>I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant, it was quite small with a romantic vibe and great decor. <br><br>The entrees run from about $20 to 30 dollars, not bad at all, and good quantity.

I came here with friends for a wine dinner, and I couldn't have been happier with my experience on the whole.<br><br>Since we were a group of 7, we decided on basically treating everything family style. We started of with a round of the bruschetta and the caprese. The bruschetta was just killer. There was just the right amount of everything on it. The caprese also made the perfectly compliment. The tomatoes melted when you ate them. After the round of appetizers, we continued with the mushroom risotto. This was also a great way to start things off. The risotto was done perfectly and the mushrooms really added a savory quality we didn't have in the first two dishes. <br><br>On the main dishes, we started off with the Bolognese. I was a real fan of the sauce as there was a good amount of meat. It wasn't all meat though and the sauce was savory to work perfectly with our barolos. Since we had Barolos in front of us, it was only natural to get the Osso Buco. This turned out to be the great choice we all thought it would be. There is a lot of it here, so it really did work best having the smaller portions doing it family style. <br><br>The service was really good as well. Our waiter was always available for us and it was never a problem getting our orders. <br><br>The entire experience makes me definitely want to come back here, and I'm very certain a return will happen.

We agreed because the table was right near the door and the winter winds were blasting in cold air. We were rewarded with a cute table in the back corner, screened off from the hustle of the hallway. Our waitress was incredibly kind and polite. She could have come back more often - or just left a pitcher of water on the table - but the place was jammed and I think they were understaffed.

I think I would have preferred the red, but I really have no complaints. The muscles were well cooked and buttery. B<br><br>Salad: We again split this one and ordered the Caprese salad. Meh. I was actually disappointed that an Italian place could serve a mediocre caprese salad. It was under seasoned and the olive oil served with it had no real flavor. I actually used the salt and pepper shakers on the table (something I haven't done in years) to flavor the dish ever so slightly. That said, everything tasted fresh and light and just simply needed some better ingredients. C-<br><br>Entrees: I ordered the Ossobucco and was greeted with a plate of super rich, super awesome heaven. I've never had this dish before, so I have no basis of comparison, but it was really good. I only did finish half. The veal shank is served atop a mini meat lasagne which provided a nice break from the dish and gave a different texture and flavor. At $33, I don't know if I would order this again, but I was certainly not unhappy with my choice. My wife ordered the lobster ravioli and she cleaned the plate up. The lobster ravioli was served with some apple chunks, which we thought was just odd, but I guess they were there to cut through the sauce which was slightly tangy and think.

The ladyfingers were either not soaked and simply drizzled with espresso or they used really subpar espresso.

This place is enormous - they have main seating, seating in the back, and outdoor seating. We started off with apps by splitting the grilled calamari, which I wasn't a big fan of. I don't think balsamic goes well with calamari, and it both looked and tasted strange. I've NEVER seen calamari that isn't sliced into rings, so I was taken aback by these odd, tube-like, chewy things on my plate. We also had the stella salad, which I approve of because it was fresh and featured some fruit.<br><br>For my main, I ordered the zuppa de pesce, which came in a ridiculously large ceramic tub. By tub, I do mean tub because it was larger than my face. I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars, and I'm ultimately giving a 3.5 rounding down because I've been eating leftovers from this tub for the past two days and I'm starting to resent it because it's still not done (and I swear that I'm a big eater). Also, the mussels were kinda stinky and just not fresh. <br><br>My bf's vitello ossobuco was delicious though. I'm a huge fan of veal, unwillingly so because the idea of eating baby cows is sad so I never order it, but I guess I don't mind devouring it if someone else ordered it (and it's just so tasty). It was fork tender and came with some very tasty lasagna. <br><br>For dessert, we had the chocolate hazelnut panna cotta, which was super rich and resembled a molded pudding. I liked it, and it went well with the free coffee (which you can get from checking in on yelp!).<br><br>Service was good initially, but became super slow at the end of the meal. It took forever to get our table cleared and to get our check, but they did keep my water glass full throughout the meal, so I guess the service averages out to good.

The wine list was a bit overwhelming, but our waitress, Jenna, made a great wine selection for our meals. <br><br>Each of us got a different kind of ravioli. I ordered the Rabbit Ravioli which was delicious. The ravioli was stuffed with a mixture of ground rabbit and ricotta cheese in a savory mushroom sauce. Though I liked my Rabbit Ravioli, the other 2 entrees were fantastic. Cappellacci all'Aragosta (Pasta stuffed with lobster) was the best dish winner of the evening. The pasta had an amazing sauce that the group wanted to continually dip our bread in!

The pasta is made fresh daily (from scratch) which we appreciate. Some of its more popular dishes include: Homemade pumpkin ravioli; Lobster ravioli; Cappellacci Di Zucca and Osso Bucco. If you are a rib fan you may want to try their \"Milk and Honey\" ribs which were excellent (my husband had these and his final rating was five stars). Their signature dish is the \"Zuppa di Pesce\" (Seafood Soup) which is amalgamated with a variety of fresh seafood and shellfish. This entrée is worth every dime since it has over 1-lb of fresh, delectable seafood. It offers Southern Italian cuisine with a few entrée(s) from Northern Italy. We enjoyed our experience at this casual, but romantic Italian restaurant. It is obvious that they want their customers to feel like they are getting the VIP treatment from the second your foot hits the door. <br><br>SERVICE: Excellent and Engaging; Hospitable Servers; VIP Treatment<br>PRICE-POINT: Moderate to High; <br>FOOD: Innovative and outstanding while other entrée(s) were fairly \"Good\"<br>WINE: Excellent variety -- ask your Server which wine to pair with your dinner<br>Generous Portions.  For starters we tried the Zuppa di Zucca (Butternut Squash Soup) -- a cup goes for 4.75 while a bowl is 5.95 (really overpriced). This soup equals four stars. The cup was very small, so we only got a small taste of the soup. If the soup was Lobster Bisque I would consider it a fair price, but this was not the case.<br><br>Our MAIN entrée(s) consisted of the following:<br>(1) Cappellacci di Zucca amalgamated with pumpkin in a burnt butter sauce with butternut squash, sage and pine nuts. This is stuffed pasta, and worth four stars. <br>(2) Pennette Cardinale served with grilled artichokes, chicken, shallots and sun-dried tomatoes in a white wine reduction sauce with a touch of light cream. Five stars<br>(3) Linguini alle Vongole sauteed with fresh clams and garlic in a white wine sauce Five stars;<br>(4) Zuppa Di Pesce (hearty and savory soup with fresh seafood and a \"must\" try). The consistency is more like a stew than soup. It is delicate in flavor and well-balanced. Five stars;<br>(5) Milk and Honey Ribs which were described as \"succulent and incredibly flavorful\" with a unique sauce. Five stars<br><br>Every Monday, they offer an 8-course \"Family Style\" entrée. It includes two appetizers, two soups/salads, three entrees and dessert. All of this for $20.95 which is a pretty good deal!!!  This is certainly a unique way of getting customers in the door on a day of the week when most people do not go out to eat. They offer a version of Italian \"Tapas\" every Tuesday with \"Live\" Jazz music. We will definitely return on Monday and also for their Tuesday evening Jazz and food experience. We enjoyed our dinner, the service and food. We'll return again, but ONLY for a \"special\" occasion since the price-point does not allow for dining here on a regular basis. Maybe they should consider offering \"half-price\" off on a select few entrée(s) during the week (Wednesday or Thursday). Also, cut the price of dessert by half.....<br><br>Get me to come here more often (and other customers too)......just sayin'! Overall, the rating is four stars. Yes, I'm a fan, but there are other Italian restaurants in Chicago that are \"as good as it gets!\" The price point on Yelp is listed as \"moderate\" but I would say it is more \"moderate to high\" ($$ to $$$). <br><br>Some History: The restaurant opened in 2001, so they are obviously doing something right.  The Chef, Anthony Barbanente, is a Chicago native, but spent most of his life on his grandfather's farm in Southern Italy.

She ordered a pasta dish with chicken and sundried tomato and I got the squid ink gnocchi with calamari (per the servers recommendations) It was a special so I though it would be fresh. Her pasta came out in a huge mound, mine was a much smaller portion. Her pasta was actually really tasty, but tasty in the way that craft mac and cheese is tasty, nothing I would expect from an upscale Italian place. My gnocchi was dry and the calamari rubbery, the red sauce was ok...i was not pleased overall and almost sent it back, but didn't want to bother. <br><br>The other thing that bugged me about this place was how dressy everyone was, it was a bunch of middle aged couples that looked like they came from the suburbs for a \"night out in the city\" it was bizarre to say the least.

Look, I don't know how to say this other than: it was bad and it was expensive.  Now, I'd like to believe that those who have extended five-star reviews to this joke of an establishment had reason to do so and are not merely blood relatives of the staff, but quite frankly I can't imagine any scenario in which this would be the case. <br><br>To begin with, a meal consisting of 1 appetizer, 1 salad, 1 entree and 1 bottle of wine (all shared between two people) put us at close to $100.  This, of course, is fine if you are Spiaggia or Piccolo Sogno or Socca or Topo Gigio or basically any Chicago area trattoria or ristorante that has even the slightest understanding of flavor or creativity when it comes to its dishes.  Instead, we were plated the sort of bland, uninspired, faux-Sicilian slop that even your average Olive Garden patron would fall asleep halfway through eating.<br><br>I don't remember anything that we consumed  being served what one would call \"warm,\" and while the food wasn't outwardly offensive, it did make me regret not simply staying home with a packet of Buitoni and a jar of Prego.  At least then my palate would have enjoyed some sort of stimulation.<br><br>The biggest slap in the face came with the check, when I realized there were about 10 restaurants within a 2 block radius where I could have had a much better meal for a significantly smaller chunk of dough.  These include Barrio, Kuma's Too, Raj Darbar, Noodles in a Pot, and hell, even Kentucky Fried Chicken.  Yes, I am 100% serious.<br><br>At the end of the day, I guess this place is fine if you're some Wrigleyville bro lookin' to impress that fly honey you met at Big City Tap last Friday night.  But for anyone who cares even the slightest about things like taste, nuance, and deliciousness, this is not a place for you.  I for one, will not be coming back.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This is an excellent (albeit slightly expensive) Italian experience.

The coffee served in the carafe was cold. I raised the issue with the manager; but nothing was done about it. The dessert is not exemplary and common bistro dessert fare. Adding insult to injury, the manager asked our party to leave to free up the table for other patrons waiting; when in fact we were just waiting for our bill to be rectified. One couple's bill read $ 1.62 only which took within normal time to rectify it. The manager was rude and did not gather his facts with our server to assess the reason for the wait. Instead, he approached one of my guest to inform us to leave. NOT GOOD FOR BUSINESS! My guest returned him that he was rude and explained to him the reason for the wait. It left a bad taste in my mouth and the manager did not offer any apologies. He lacks the skill set to be a restaurant manager in what may have been a stressful who did not handle the dinner rush crowd very well.

The parking was very easy and accessible (free access to the Home Depot garage practically next store - an AWESOME perk of dining there!) <br>The restaurant was really cute inside. Loved the little Christmas lights hanging from the walls. It looks like they have a cute patio for when the weather finally heats up.<br>I would suggest making a reservation, I'm pretty sure most people had them. We were seated at a table right near the front door so it was pretty drafty, I would suggest asking for a table further in the back if you can get it (oddly our reservation was at 7, but it didn't start getting crowded until around 8 when it got jammed). <br>The service was pleasant and the food was very good. I got some type of appetizer special - it was some type of garlic bread topped with mozzarella, tomatoes, and prosciutto. Absolutely delicious. My boyfriend got the caesar salad which he thought was decent (it had a bit of a tangier taste then a normal caesar salad - I thought it was great but I could see how one might not like it). <br>For dinner he had the salmon which he thought was very good. I had the rigatoni caprese (noodle tubes with a marinara type sauce and slightly melted mozz - SOOO good!!). I didn't really happen to like any of the dessert choices on the menu, so we got the bf's fave. The tiramisu for dessert was surprisingly a huge winner. I don't normally even like tiramisu, but it was very good. <br>The reason that I am deducting one star is for the prices of this place. Granted, I had a Groupon, but even then with tax/tip and no drinks I still shelled out around thirty dollars per person. I would imagine without a Groupon it would be pretty steep. The pasta dishes were all around $20 each, which is a several dollars more than what you would normally pay for a comparable Italian restaurant in the area.

I highly recommend this appetizer for folks who enjoy good seafood. For main dishes, I ordered a seafood gnocchi dish and hubby ordered a seafood risotto dish.

Bought it through my phone, and off we went, a short 5-10 minute walk to, what I thought, was a small Halsted eatery. We arrived around 6:00 PM. About a handful of tables were taken in what I thought was the whole restaurant. When the host asked where we wanted to be seated and I said the back, I did not expect to see that much hidden space available! Down side, chair room could be limited if you are the type to sit at the edge of your seat. They do try to put as many tables as they can in each nook and I can see why. By the time it hit 7:00PM, the line was out the door and it was jam packed. Bravo to us for great timing. <br><br>-Appetizer: Grilled calamari was perfectly cooked and the sauce it was in was delicious. Even though I try to stay away from the free hot from the oven bread they give you in the beginning so I don't get myself full from it, it happened. And it was all because of that darn sauce. I get picky with any seafood because I hate the toughness and over chewy texture it can be when over cooked. But this grilled calamari was phenomenal. A light chew but overall buttery taste. <br><br>-Con: The fried up version (I saw from the next table) portion looked bigger than ours. Maybe the breading of the fried calamari puffens up the look. But our cute plate of laid out squid looked minimal. But not a huge complaint that I wouldn't get it again, and the boyfriend agreed, we actually prefer it grilled. No matter the portion size. <br><br>-Main Course: I ordered the Linguini alle Vongole and he ordered the Spaghetti Barese<br>Portions: HUGE. I mean, my boyfriend who eats for three couldn't finish. The veal meatball was so soft, you barley had to chew it. It was great!! I am not a fan of meatball, and can't stand the rough bumpy texture, but this was so smooth and BIG! The muscles in my pasta were delicious, the white wine sauce, I felt, was a little oily, but the generous amounts of garlic balanced it out for me! <br><br>-Con: Previously mentioned, white wine sauce was a little oily, but it was balanced out by the garlic so it neutralized it. <br><br>Verdit:: Would I come again. YES. Perfect for a girls night dinner. Four people, one appetizer and two pasta dishes should do the trick! I didn't get the check out their wine list, but I am sure it had a great variety. Also, checking in for a free cappuccino doesn't hurt. The place offered great deals, the food was great! A small complaint for waiting a little to long for our waitress to come to us with our check.

The front dining area is designed really poorly and there is barely any standing room while you wait. So everyone is smooshed on top of each other by the door.

I am kicking myself for not remembering the name but her suggestion was perfect.  She let me try both and her's really was the better choice.<br><br>Food: They bring you bread to your table to dip into the olive oil and Parmesan cheese and it was so hard to eat only one piece but I knew I had so much more food coming. We ordered the Crostini Di Avocado, and I never thought to put avocado basically on a bruschetta but it was delicious. I liked that it had the cheese mixed in and the olive oil was a nice compliment to the avocado.  We also had the bruschetta and it was piled high with tomatoes and had plenty of olive oil too. <br><br>We then had the Butternut Squash Soup and cesar salad.  I am not huge fan of squash but there was something interesting going there with a mix of the sweet squash and then a more salty soup base.  The cesar was good too, I swear there were anchovies in the dressing (which is something I prefer) so 2nd course down.<br><br>Entrees: Since we had to order three and there was only two of us we decided to get one dish we both wanted to try then the third was something we randomly picked.  My friend ordered the Spaghetti Barese which came with veal meatballs and Italian sausage. The meatballs were some of the best I ever have eaten and I don't normally order a standard spaghetti when I go out.  I had the Risotto Pescatore with the seafood and I haven't had risotto like this in 4 years. I remember the exact last time I had a risotto as rich and creamy as this and it has taking me a long time to find another that I love just as much.  Our third was, Bass alla Piccata which was a nice compliment to our other heavy dishes. The bass was light and and flaky and the veggies that came with it were fresh and crunchy.<br><br>By this time I was ready to be rolled out of there and tempted to ask the CFD if they would drive me home but we still had dessert. We had the pana cotta and I realized I have never eaten it before. I could only handle a few bites but the texture was somewhere between a mousse and pudding and ice cream. My friend ate every bite and wanted to lick the plate clean.<br><br>I am definitely going to make this my go to restaurant when I am in the mood for some comfort Italian. I thought we had to bring the coupon in but they were offering the special to everyone who came in. I also want to try the Wednesday three course dinner.

We never experienced the warm, delicious bread that other reviewers praised. We ordered the burrata appetizer and though the cheese was good, the accoutrements that accompanied it were nothing exciting. I'm sure after a few glasses of wine, the appetizer piled high with prosciutto would be salty and delicious, but that shouldn't be the main element of the dish when it's described as a burrata appetizer.  The salad was sad to say the least. I was expecting a plate of hot, perfectly grilled asparagus with a tasteful drizzle of lemon vinaigrette and some crumbled goat cheese, but instead, it was chopped up cold grilled asparagus on a bed of greens with lemon wedge on the side. It was quite bland and really had no creative or artistic vision behind the dish - it felt like they wanted to give us what was left over in the kitchen. I would have rather had what was described on the menu in place of what we ate.  And finally, the Yelp-raved pumpkin ravioli was a bore. The crunchy, though oily butternut squash cubes really saved the dish. The ravioli pasta was nice and thin, but the filling was really bland. To top it off, the burnt butter sauce I was looking forward to was had no distinct nutty flavor, but just felt like a puddle of melted butter. Overall, I was appalled by the price of the food - it was EXTREMELY expensive for the quality.  We both have had MUCH better food in this city for the same price or less.<br><br>On top of all of this, I disliked the service.

The table was very narrow across, had there been 4 in our party it would've felt really cramped. The tall chairs were very difficult to scoot closer to the table too, causing my parents problems. <br>- Service was inattentive; friendly, but inattentive. We had big lulls in our meal - our meals took a long time to arrive; we got the wrong dishes brought to our table; and we had to request our bread and drinks be replenished. Maybe our server was also covering the back of the place, because most times we couldn't even find her on the floor to get her attention. <br>- Meals are expensive. Pasta entrees range between $20-22 and are a la carte. First, I think there should be more than a $1-2 price disparity between a simple pasta with red sauce and something like lobster ravioli, linguine and clams, or pasta with veal meatballs. Second, I think at that price point a choice of soup or salad is appropriate. <br>- The TV in the \"bar area\" is unnecessary, if not inappropriate for the setting, even with the sound off.

The chicken/pesto gnocchi and butternut squash ravioli in sage butter are incredibly tasty and not too heavy. The calimari friti are well-seasoned and perfectly crispy.

The wine pairings are really nice, and the presentation is beautiful.<br><br>The staff is also incredibly nice and helpful. I went to Sapori for a celebratory dinner, which I told the staff about when making our reservation - and they printed special menus for our group, congratulating the guest of honor. Personal touches like that definitely mean something.<br><br>My only negatives are: 1) the restaurant is relatively small and can get pretty crowded and loud (though the outdoor seating is very nice in the warmer months, and can be very romantic); and 2) the spaghetti bolognese/lasagna were nothing to write home about.

I do not eat pasta out too often, but I would say these two items were definitely worth it. Nice large portions, too. Both dishes were bursting with flavor, served at a good temperature and of course, very filling. The dinner salads are a good size, too (which should keep one from eating too much pasta-right!). The dressing was light enough but just a bit too heavy on the balsamic vinegar for my taste. I loved the tongue shui of the shaved carrots, though. We shared a bread pudding dessert which was small in portion, and big, big on texture and flavors. Lot's of things going on there. Raspberry things. Chocolate things.

(But is was.)<br>The food: Friend and I opted to share the Stella salad and seafood risotto.<br>Without being asked, the kitchen split both dishes for us and most importantly, we WERE NOT charged for this inconvenience. Nor were we made to feel bad about having wimpy girly stomachs. Very good.<br>The salad was good, but I would have preferred a little less dressing. I'm picky though. The risotto was great--VERY generous portions of most everything--but after 3 pieces of bread, I couldn't finish it. Note: Each table gets its own thing of parmesan and olive oil = dangerous.<br>Love that a large Pellegrino is only $5 and the waitress remembered the extra limes. She wasn't the most attentive, but she was very efficient and we didn't have to flag her down when we wanted the check. Again, important and good. The manager looked familiar, but gave me a crazy look when I asked if I knew him from somewhere. Why do I include this? Dunno, just so you'll know that it ended on an awkward note. All-around, it was solid, not special.<br>I always forget about those $12 coupons, but if you can snag one of those, it's an even better deal!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Went here the other night with a friend.

I went with a Cabernet Sauvignon and it was great. I ordered the rack of lamb with smashed potatoes. Definitely was a good choice. By then end of it nothing was left, not even the bread on the table.

The homemade linguini was excellent. Well worth the very modest $30, we've paid a lot more for a lot less at other restaurants. The girls split the Vitello Paesana and left nothing on the plate. The Executive Chef Anthony came out and introduced himself and we talked for a bit. He was very nice and shared a few stories with us. We then ordered a couple desserts, Tiramisu and Bread Pudding.

I guess they're right when they say don't judge a book by it's cover, whoever they are. <br><br>Anyway, on to the food. Yum. As I mentioned, we did the family style dinner, so we had lots of food. First of all, the bread is a good indication of what's to come. It was warm and soft on the inside with a nice crunchy crust. I love that they give you Parmesan cheese with the olive oil to make a pasty (and tasty) dip for the bread. We started with the grilled calamari and avocado crostini (the crostini was so simple but so good), moved on to minestrone soup and caprese salad (both good), then 3 pastas: penne with a tomato-ish sauce, pumpkin ravioli with butternut squash and pine nuts and spaghetti-ish noodles with a shrimp and a broccoli puree sauce. All were fantastic. The ravioli is so rich and decadent, which is offset well with the pine nuts and squash. My favorite was the one with the broccoli puree. Who'd of thought to puree broccoli for a pasta sauce? Not me, but I loved it. We finished with the bread pudding, which was very good, but I was so full by that point I really couldn't eat much more. We had plenty of leftovers; I definitely think the family style is a great deal. <br><br>Our waiter was very helpful in his suggestions and was entertaining in his wittiness. As I mentioned, this place just oozes coziness. It's great for a date, an evening with the girls, or whatever occasion, really. We sat by the front window, and it was nice to bask in the warmth, enjoying our delicious wine and food, while watching the bundled up masses hustle by out on Halsted. <br><br>The bathroom is bright and clean and fine, but it could use some girly decor to up the cuteness factor.
