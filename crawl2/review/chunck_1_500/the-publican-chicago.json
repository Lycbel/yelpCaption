We had a few places picked out but ended up going with The Publican and I am so glad we did. We ate about three dozen oysters and from arrival to departure it was great. <br><br>The restaurant itself was beautiful in design. I loved that it didn't stand out from the street but once you entered, you could not help but admire the décor. The ambiance was perfect, the lights were not too bright and the music was not too loud. It was a great place to enjoy quality time while enjoying quality food. Whether you are with a big party or just you and a loved one they have the floor plan to accommodate it all. <br><br>Our server was so nice, very knowledgeable of the menu, and ready to answer any questions that awaited. He checked on us frequently to ensure our food was delicious and our drinks were full. The drink menu was as large or larger than actual food menus I have seen at other restaurants. The food menu was very extensive as well with tons of options, however we did only stay for the oysters. I will indeed be back to try more!!!!!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "We had a 5:30 reservation.  Needless to say, the place is pretty much empty this early.  I asked the hostess to seat me as my party is a few minutes behind.  She was beyond rude, barely paying attention to me. After being forced to sit st the bar (while all tables were empty) with 5 out of the 6 people in the reservation this horrible hostess would not sit us at a table after several requests.  First impression. Was very poor!!!!  I ordered an old fashion....tasted like rye on the rocks.  A colleague ordered a glass of wine only to get it In what looks like a water glass..... finally sat us at table.  Bread was amazing!!!!  Food pretty good, but a bit salty. <br><br>I expected a lot more", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I always wanted to try The Publican since it is well known for their meats and I finally got to try it. Interior is modern, decorated with many round light fixtures and heavy wooden tables and chairs. We were the first ones to get there for their Saturday brunch so there was no wait. <br><br>We ordered the following:<br>- Mushroom scramble: good if you're not feeling the meat first thing in the morning, nice and light. The portion is a bit small.<br>- Tasso ham toast: thinly sliced ham over toast topped with a sunnyside egg. The giardiniera is on the sweeter side, I wish it was spicier.<br>- Publican bacon: delicious - not your usual bacon, they are thick (I mean really thick) and taste more like ham. <br>- Crispy potato: mighty super delicious! Smashed potato, perfectly crispy and seasoned.<br>- Buttermilk biscuit: decent, wish it was more buttery. <br>- Sticky bun - The server recommended that this is a must to try side but it is a very familiar taste. Still good though.<br>- Coffee & cream French cruller: kind of dry and not sweet enough, I was a bit disappointed.<br>Mimosa was strong and delicious and Gio's michelada, made with mezcal and tequila was really good as well. Service was amazing. We told our server that our friends just got married that morning and she gave them 2 glasses of rieslings on the house!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Lucky we were able to reserve a table for dinner a few days beforehand! <br><br>The restaurant was slightly difficult to find because there's no name outside.

The wooden tables are high rise, shared, or booths. It was packed. Downside was that it was super loud and hard to hear conversation across the table. <br><br>Service: Our waitress (I think red hair and glasses) gave us good suggestions since it was our first time eating here. Our waters were filled often and dirty plates taken away almost as soon as we were done to make room for the next dishes. <br><br>Food: Amazing!

When my buddy and I jumped out of our Uber, I thought the place looked like a deli. It turns out we were at Publican Quality Meats across the street. That deli looked amazing and we spent a few minutes walking through before heading over The Publican. <br><br>A very classy looking place and seemed very similar, in many ways, to The Playground back home in Santa Ana. They had booth seating with swinging doors to add a bit more privacy but we were seated in the communal bench seating area. The place is pretty loud so be prepared. We got the corner two seats and the folks around us were pretty cool to be around us. <br><br>Christopher served us with precision all evening. We quickly realized he could put together a suggested meal for us if we gave him a couple of hints of what we liked. He suggested some great beers and we each picked a few dishes until we had a belly full of suggestions. <br><br>Eating family or tapas style is a great way to go if you are adventurous. The charcuterie plate was a great way to get several tastes of their specialty meats. Head cheese, sausage, salami, pickles, caper berries and a couple of mustards and their super crunchy baguette. Whole fried whiting (think large sardine) with fried dill pickles and a tangy rich sauce. Barbecued carrots, boneless leg of lamb with Brussels sprouts. Incredible taste, ingredients and presentation. Hot apple pie type of dish with sherry ice cream finished it off. <br><br>Not overly expensive and certainly worth the price of admission. A real foodie treat.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Loved the atmosphere, service, and food! <br><br>When you walk in, it looks like a beer garden with the family style long tables and the lighting. My friends and I were seated in this booth, that had these enclosed doors so I loved the privateness of it. <br><br>They have an extensive beer menu, with beer with Belgian backgrounds to local Chicago favorites. <br><br>Food wise, the portions the huge, so sharing is recommended. We tried the sweet potato dish, that came with this lovely creamy aioli sauce. We also had the sirloin and the porchetta. The sirloin was on the smaller side, but was very delicious and was not heavy at all. Although tasty, the Porchetta was pretty fatty. It came in a great sauce and was served with roast potatoes. <br><br>We were surely left stuffed!

The menu has a lot of interesting dishes to choose from. I also highly recommend that your group order a bunch of different dishes to share. This isn't one of those places where you get your own personal dish plus it's always fun to share food. <br><br>We started out in the bar. I tried ordering Titos and was quickly shot down. Apparently an ex-employee started a vodka company in Madison, Wisconsin and they exclusively serve their vodka. Okay I'm game! Let's do this! I started with a vodka and soda with a fresh lemon wedge. It was the perfect refreshing drink after a long day of working.  <br><br>Our table was ready and we were moved to a community table which I'm cool with unless your neighbors have never been to Europe or are afraid of their own shadow. Let's say our new friends were both. That's okay we're going to have more fun then you anyways. You had your chance to join the cool kids. <br><br>We decided we needed to start with a plate of meat but how do you choose just one ham? You can't so I highly recommend you go for the Trio of Hams. Our dish came with Edward's Country Ham which was smoky and sweet from Surry, Virginia. As well as La Quercia Rosa which was gentle and balanced from Norwalk, Iowa and finally Fermin Serrano which was rich and wild from salamanca. It was so hard to pick a favorite or even remember which ham was which. I do know that all of them were fantastic. This was the start of a perfect evening. <br><br>Next we had Potted Rillettes which was served in a jar with sourdough bread. It's not a very pretty looking dish but it's really damn tasty. I highly recommend it because it will be your new favorite. I also love knowing where the pigs came from. If your curious the pigs are from Mick klug farm located in St. Joseph, Michigan. Talk about eating local. <br><br>Our next dish to share was the Pork Belly and it was really good. I'm always worried about pork belly because I find that the dish is either done perfect or done bad. Luckily they served it good here and I would not expect anything less from this is place. Other dishes I'd recommend include the BBQ carrots which were surprisingly delicious. We also accidentally ordered the frites which blew us away. It reminded me of walking down the streets of Europe with a cone and a wooden toothpick to eat. The added bonus here was that they even served the fries with mayo. This was the tastiest mistake we made all night. I would also advise you to stay away from the Shishito Pepper Plate. It was my least favorite dish of the night. <br><br>For dessert you have to go with the homemade ice cream. We couldn't decide on just one flavor and made them make us a trio of ice cream. Kind of like the trio of ham. The ice cream here will blow you away. We also got the waffle but I can't even remember if it was good because the ice cream was so amazingly yummy. <br><br>So the next time you're looking for a meating then this is your place. The Publican is located in the historic meat packing district of Chicago which is rapidly disappearing to trendy restaurants, hotels and corporate giants. I miss the old neighborhood but you can't stop progress or trends.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oVfysGlwTbcDuY_Vob2M-w/168s.jpg", "caption": "The bbq carrots rocked!"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8BQhMg3Ntl6wTe5_qVUbog/168s.jpg", "caption": "There's nothing like a trio of ham platter!"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "I came here with a few of my friends for a \"Friendsgiving\" celebration the other night and all I can say is WOW!<br><br>We ordered 5 different dishes to share as a table and each one was better than the last!  The first thing we are were the honeycrisp apples with horseradish ricotta and it was a delightfully sweet and savory dish that had just the right amount of kick with horseradish.  After that, we had french fries come out with the mussels, and I can't say enough good things about the mussels.  The white wine and garlic based broth was great, but the highlight of the mussels were the actual size of the mussels! I don't know where they got these things, but every place in the city needs to get in on these because man were they good and meaty!  The french fries were great, as was the aioli served with them, and they were even better dipped in the mussel broth.<br><br>After finishing all of our appetizers, we were on to the meats.  We ordered the ribs and the pork belly, both of which were spectacular.  The ribs were much more of a traditional rib but the flavors were just spectacular, combining lime and peanuts.  With all of this being said, the star of the night was easily the pork belly for me.  It was cooked perfectly, with fat that you could press up against the roof of your mouth and it would literally disintegrate.  The flavors were Asian inspired, and the rice that it was served over was cooked to perfection.<br><br>One of the biggest surprises of the night was that, after finishing our meal and asking for the check, our waiter took it upon himself to bring us a free dessert!  We did not see this coming, and were blown away by the generosity of the staff.  The dessert that they brought us was the pumpkin bread pudding, and while it was not the table's favorite dish, the thought is what counted.<br><br>The quality of the food combined with the atmosphere of the restaurant and the fantastic wait staff made for a memorable night, and a guarantee of returning.

The best waitress we've ever had in Chicago made the experience even better. I can't remember her name but she had wavey light brown hair and glasses and she took her time explaining every single dish and making suggestions along the way. We decided to start off with some serrano ham with a side of honeycrisp apples. Perfect salty sweet combo! Then we ordered a big bowl of mussels with a side of peasant bread to soak up the broth.

My friends had the pastrami sandwich with an over easy egg and I had pancakes sprinkled with scramble eggs and sprinkled bacon. I also ordered their crispy potatoes with an over easy egg on top.

We went back to check 20 minutes later since no one had gotten us and they sat us right away, with all of those tables remaining empty the entire time. <br><br>Many of their brunch items are a la carte, so we ordered a pastry, some breakfast sausage, a waffle, 2 scrambled eggs, and a dish with some corn and poached eggs. Meanwhile, we had some coffee poured and my brother had to ask twice for silverware and creamer which never came, so he got some from another table. 15 minutes later the pastry came out, and then another 15 minutes later our breakfast sausage came, and then you guessed it... 15 minutes later the rest of our breakfast.  The corn dish was at least $13 and was simply a plate of roasted corn with an overcooked poached egg on top. <br><br>It was an odd experience and between the service and mediocre food I can't say I'll be rushing back.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Incredible brunch spot.

I sat outside both times and if I were fortunate to live in my favorite vacation city, i would sit inside too as the ambiance is nice and modern, warm and welcoming.

Next came a house smoked mackerel with potatoes chips, and a charred cauliflower dish.  The smoked mackerel was outstanding - perfectly smoked and perfectly prepared - wonderful dish all around.  <br><br>The next course was memorable in all if the best ways - a 60 day dry aged sirloin with fennel and goat cheese slaw, and an craving inducing deep fried sweet potatoes with cane sugar and a lime crema.  The steak was beautifully prepared to a medium rare (a picture perfect medium rare), wonderfully seasoned, and had just the right amount of acid pop from the slaw.  The deep fried sweet potatoes will change your \"foody\" life (not literally, but maybe...).  We have never had such sweet, tender chunks of breaded goodness - they were like eating donuts made with healthy (!) sweet potatoes.<br><br>We then, relunctantly, moved on to a sea bass in pork broth and porchetta roast.  The sea bass was prepared nicely, nicely flaky, but was a bit of a let down just because the previous dishes were so wonderful.  The porchetta roast (house made) was also extremely good, really well prepared, but still a touch of a let down as compared to the previous courses.  Again, both dishes were wonderful as stand alone courses but when compared to everything that came before, which were exceptional, were a touch of a let down.<br><br>However, the desert dishes of ice cream (coffee and brownie) on a waffle, and an egg nog tres leches cake, were the prefect end to the meal. <br><br>The service was friendly, fast and courteous and very knowledgeable of the menu.  The drink menu was extensive, very well priced, and they have an enormous and unique beer list.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The amazing five star reviews I read before coming here that detailed the great food somehow didn't match up to the experience I had.

Van Halen echoed through enough times to made me think that it wasn't a coincidence, someone liked the sound of David Lee Roth.<br>As I walked into the main dining room I noticed the irony of the artwork on the walls.  Caricatures of overly fattened swine adorned each wall hinting that either that the restaurant specialized in pig, or you'd feel like one by the time you were done eating.  On this particular night both were true.  I had a variety of different pork dishes, and walked out feeling sufficiently stuffed.  <br><br>Seating - There's a huge horseshoe shaped table in the middle of the main room, with 4 person booths along one wall.  The booths have low doors on them that are reminiscent of farm animal pens, but also provide some privacy if you prefer that over a shared table.  Determine ahead of time if you want to be off by yourself or seated next to strangers.   <br><br>Pork Rinds - Not what I would typically order and don't expect these to be similar to what you get out of a bag in a vending machine.  These were served in a conical paper funnel and were so light and airy they almost melted in your mouth.  The seasoning dust spiced these substantially.  Caution - Don't inhale while eating these as you might get a lungful of spicy dust and end up coughing the rest of the night.<br><br>Vegetables - This was probably the biggest surprise of the night. I went in knowing that this place specializes in high end meats, but had no idea I would enjoy the vegetable as much as anything else.  The Cauliflower was roasted until browned and crispy on the edges and only lightly dressed with herbs and cheese. The Barbequed Carrots had distinct grill marks and were sweet and nicely balanced by the dill and pecans.  Our Squash dish was cooked soft and sprinkled with feta, pomegranate, and pumpkin seeds.  Each single source farmed and all were fresh and full of flavor.   <br><br>Pork Belly - This is a must order and was unlike the Asian style pork belly I was accustomed to.  Rather than having to peel off thick layers of fat, the meat was slow cooked and marbled with melted fat.  So tender that you could cut it with a fork and seasoned with wild onions and grapes.  This is the only pork belly that will literally melt in your mouth.<br><br>Taste of Three Hams - A sort of ham sampling if you want to do some compare and contrasting.  We were given paper thin slices of Kentucky, Iowa, and Spanish hams.  All good and all different.  If this is your first time at publican or you're a ham fan and not sure what to get, this sampling is for you. <br><br>Dry Aged Ribeye - Not on the menu so feel fortunate if its available when you order.  A solid 22 ounces of buttery Ribeye sliced and served with roasted potatoes.  We ordered Medium-Rare and it was cooked just right.  A nice dish to share.<br><br>Dessert - We are too full to order dessert, but couldn't resist ordering a big Cookie Jar filled with surprises.  Ours came as a sort of sad bear with a blue bow tie, but inside was a combination of chocolates, chocolate cookies, rice crispy treats, and layered dessert bars.  It was fun passing the cookie jar around and sharing with the group and good way to end the night.<br><br>Service - Our main server Joanna was efficient, knowledgeable, and friendly despite the heavy crown on a Monday night.  She gave us good suggestions and complimented us on our broad choice of shareable dishes. In the end there were probably 4 people that brought dishes and cleared our table.<br><br>Overall, the Publican does some outstanding meats, but don't forget the surprisingly good vegetable sides.

Wow, as a DC native I can honestly say that this Chicago restaurant set the standard for high quality.

Super tasty and a large dish that you can have as a large entree or share with 1-2 other people. We were pretty full but then received the bread with pimento. The bread was fresh baked and paired well with the pimento. For entrees we got the sirloin steak (5/5) and the pork shank (5++/5). The sirloin was great but definitely a smaller dish compared to the huge pork shank. Now to talk about this pork shank - WOW. The meat was falling off and cooked/flavored to perfection. It came with this slightly sour Greek yogurt sauce with a rice/some grain. Loved everything about this dish and definitely huge so have an appetite or share! For drinks, I got the Coastal Fizz, it was awesome and I got a second! <br><br>Service: I was very impressed with the service. They take their customers seriously. Shout out to our AWESOME waitress Kat (sp?). She was super friendly, attentive, informed on the menu, and handled the busy outdoor patio really well. Despite how busy she was, she took her time with us, offering suggestions and even gave us great recommendations for Chicago! You're the best Kat!! I also noticed what appeared to be the Manager walking around, helping with tables, she came over and checked in with us and other tables. Also a shout out to the bus boy staff! Again, where can I get this type of service in DC? I didn't get his name but our bus boy was super attentive and made sure our tables were clear and ready for the next dish.

These hams are a joy that should be sampled if you visit. <br><br>An Avocado Salad sounded intriguing. To play against the softness of the avocado and the feta, they wisely used a Jalapeño laced dressing.

We got the constant  feeling that we were being rushed to turn the table over.    The quality of service deteriorated from there. <br><br> The busing staff is cold and brusque. The guy that refilled our water glasses took no care and the water slopped and splashed all over the table drenching two menus.   (He didn't skip a beat.) This overrated pork place, in search of a true identity, dresses it's waitstaff in building maintenance uniforms. The service was befitting the part.<br><br> Our waitress pointed out that management recommended a family-style approach to ordering.   We took her at her word, but felt she over represented the portion sizes, especially the salads and vegetable sides, suitable for one person. Definitely not \"two or three.\"  <br><br>We ordered the donut peach salad ($14); corn on the cob ($15 for a single ear); and a \"little gem\" lettuce salad to share ($11).  The peach salad featured unripe peaches (which reappeared like a bad dream, on the pork belly) drenched in a tart over-vinegared simple dressing, not very tasty.  The corn on the cob was hardly family style. It literally was a single ear of grilled corn, priced at $15.  Caveat emptor.<br><br> For the next course, we ordered the large charcuterie plate,  traditionally served as a first or second course. The service was so mixed up and disorganized, they brought this cold platter last, shortly before the check arrived. And I'm not kidding.   When I asked our server about the timing, she defensively said \"that's the way we do that, in any order that it comes out of the kitchen.\" That's about the way it went the whole night.   Practically none of it was especially good and it's hard to picture what the small platter looks like if this was supposed to be the large -- cost $26.<br><br>Our server recommended the \"Farm Chicken\" platter, which she bragged has been on the menu since the restaurant's first opening. She was right that it was generously portioned - compared to the other skimpy dishes--but at $27 for a cut-up half roasted chicken over a bed of soggy french fries soaked in chicken grease, and no veggie sides, the value is simply not there either. Moreover, the chicken was not particularly flavorful or well seasoned. It was however smothered in salt, as is most of Publican's food.  If you take the time to read other honest reviews below, you will see that the food is over-salted. Believe it when you read it. <br><br> Perhaps most disappointing for a pork place, was what should be their signature dish: the country pork ribs ($28). Never mind the fancy description on the menu. The few sinewy ribs are nearly flavorless and they are very tough, so much that you want a sharp steak knife to peal them off the bone. So if you were waiting for fall-off-the-bone country ribs, forget it - you've come to the wrong place!<br><br>Even the Pork Belly ($25) supposedly from Rotterdam Holland (sure thing...) was skimpy, hard and relatively tough.   <br><br>As bad a value as the food is, the beverages somehow manage to be worse.   12-ounce bottles or cans of beer will set you back $8-$12, plus 25% tax and tip. The nine dollar shot glass of Mede, which is really like wine, is barely more than 3 ounces!  <br><br>I wanted to like Publican, but honestly could not find a single thing to like, except after the check came and I could final leave.<br><br> Which brings me to the last subject, the overrated reviews herein.

The sirloin was cooked perfectly n had the best sear on it so it was really crispy the walnut ajika was amaizin it was like a pesto but with more of a nut flavor with more flavor the cheese added such a great flavor loved the straberries but they werent sweet enough making a sauce n making it more sweet would have been better <br><br>Pork belly $27 best dish of the nite the pork belly was the biggiest i ever seen n it was perfectly it was supper crispy on the outside n supper tender on the inside the peaches added sweetness so it was the perfect combination of sweet and savory the beans with the sauce added richness to the richness i wanted to order it again<br><br>Porchetta $33 this was the worst dish of the nite. It was extremely bitter n had a bunch of odd flavors that didnt work together. Chicories are extremely bitter so cooking the sauce in it was a bad idea because it made the sauce bitter then theres chicories on the plat which adds to it the black berries were really acidic so it added a weird tart flavor. Then this dish need a crunch factor badly the pork was tender but not that flaborful <br><br>Farm chicken $27 amaizin the chicken was to die for it was supper tender and really flavorful the fries were cooked perfectly crispy without being greasy just wish they had some cool spices on it or something to make it unique. Thought The sausage was gonna be weird with the chicken but it actually goes together n really enhances the dish my complaint with the sausage is the sausage casing is really hard like indelible n wish the sausage was chorizo or a merguez something more flavorful this dish needs a sauce really badly something to tie it together n something spicy because hot sauce makes chicken taste way better<br><br>Buttermilk cheesecake 11$ amaizin presentation is terrible but its so tasty picture like cheese cake dumped into a bunch of sauce its kinda like a dessert soup. The cherries added tartness to cut through the sweetness the cheesecake was so good! My only issue is it needed more texture the using a cookie crust in this wssnt a good idea got mushy n was a weird texture so plz fix that maybe use a nut crust or dont put so much sauce<br><br>Toasted panna cotta 12$ amaizin the panna cotta texture was amaizin the peaches were amaizin really enhanced the dish the blackberries cut through the richness n toasted coconut added more texture just wish there was something else that added more texture <br><br>Oprah cake 12$ if u love tiramisu youll love this i didnt like it because there was to much of a coffee flavor it overwhelmed everything else", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2HBYy0B2I5G0TC3r1txhBA/348s.jpg", "caption": "Front"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Pb4spsOC4X7_YciLNEP-nA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Front door"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/J1w6ZshYlD0R6eBif4ya1g/168s.jpg", "caption": "Bill"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Pros:<br>Dishes are all well-balanced in flavor, texture, and saltiness<br>Bread is amazing<br>Chefs are not afraid to use less conventional meats like chicken liver and pork rinds--expect something interesting on the menu<br>Picnic plate had uniquely pickled cauliflower and mouthwatering bread and spread<br>Poached eggs were cooked well, and prosciutto and arugula paired perfectly<br><br>Cons:<br>Appetizers tasted good but I'd rather save my money for the entrees<br><br>Recs:<br>Order the picnic plate and an extra order of bread to share between two people<br>Visit Sawada for coffee", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/J3Bb1G5pdzfhAQRdnTlZmw/348s.jpg", "caption": "Poached eggs"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Delicious food, no doubt. But one of the best restaurants in Chicago? I'm not sure it quite lives up to the hype, in my humble opinion...<br><br>...which is shared by several other people I know...<br><br>Anyways, I'll start with a couple of the issues we had. First, the notion of food coming out when it was ready was never explained to us. So, we ordered like a normal restaurant, with appetizers then main courses for each of us. It was frustrating that each of our mains came out at different times, so essentially one of us was eating at a time. The other issue was that dessert took a while, and our server, who was fantastic besides that aforementioned lack of explanation, was clearly frustrated. It was my mom's birthday, and it took forever to get her candle out to the table. <br><br>Now that those are out of the way, the food was very tasty. Fortunately for you readers, I was able to taste all of the dishes. Appetizers were the bbq carrots, beets, and shishito peppers. The flavors in all three were great - my personal favorite was the beets. The carrots aren't super soft - some of my family liked it better that way, while I would have preferred a bit softer. I'm honestly not a huge pepper fan, but the rest of the flavors were really delicious in that dish. <br><br>For mains, we ordered mussels, halibut, beef tongue and sirloin. Again, all delicious. The sauce the mussels were bathed in was amazing, and it was great that they serve it with a fresh sourdough baguette to dip. The halibut was sublime, tender with a perfect sear on the outside. The beef tongue was also great, though maybe my least favorite of the bunch. The sirloin, which was my main, may have been my favorite. The tzatziki and feta really gave it a unique Mediterranean twist, and it was perfectly cooked. <br><br>The desserts were overall the most underwhelming part of the meal. As usual, I ordered well, but the others were not as well loved by the group. The worst was the strawberry mint sorbet. The mint was totally overpowering, and it was tough to taste the strawberry at all. My dad ordered the waffle, and added the ice cream. The weird thing about that is if you add the ice cream, they take away the fruit preserves. It was decent, but not worth getting at such a good place. The cajeta tart was very good, probably the second best dessert. The best dessert was the rhubarb crostata. It was like a warm apple strudel a la mode, but with unique flavors that set it apart. We made sure to scrape all of the crust off the skillet, so as not to leave any leftovers. <br><br>Overall, it was a very good meal, but I've had better non-Michelin Starred meals in Chicago. I'll also say if you have both carnivores and vegetarians in your group, this is a very solid compromise.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I want to preface this by saying that I was feeling extremely under the weather when we had dinner here and this might've impeded my tasting abilities and my drinking.<br><br>We had reservations about a week out for a party of 5.

Nothing really stood out to me except for the bread + cheese platter. The ham was actually also pretty good, but I was expecting to love the pasta or the carrots.

A medley of unharmonious flavors. Again, you don't get a whole lot of meat (baby sprinkles of bacon), and the whole dish is just too sweet-- just drenched in a weird syrup that tasted really odd.

The charcuterie plate was great. And the mussels had a perfect al dente texture to them (not too mushy and not hard and undercooked).

The many favorable reviews on Yelp got me all excited too! A friend and I showed up at 11am this past weekend and were seated immediately at a long communal table in the center of the restaurant. The restaurant features a confusing mess of tables going all sorts of different directions and booths along the side which had doors on them, resembling that of a stable. Kind of different but neither good or bad.<br><br>The bus boy immediately came over and offered coffee. We perused the menu checking out the options and the couple next to us had a plate of hash browns...so whatever I got I knew what side I wanted. I ordered an orange juice to start with and then went with the red wine poached eggs on toast with prosciutto and a bearnaise sauce. My friend opted for the Cajun sausage with eggs, crispy potatoes, and a pickled ramp aioli, and then the pecan sticky bun as a side. <br><br>The sticky bun arrived right away and it was pretty good. Generally I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon or pecans but I ate my half and enjoyed it. It wasn't too messy to eat and tasted great. My hash browns arrived next before our meal but I left them alone waiting for the entrees. Our meals arrived not long after and it all looked really good. The poached eggs were cooked well and had a cool purple color to them from the red wine they were poached in. I didn't even know you could do that?!? The toast I got, however, was burnt to a crisp and nearly inedible. Of the two pieces of sourdough I got one was completely black and the other was not far off. I'm no chef but toasting bread shouldn't be hard. The prosciutto was good but it was just piled up on the side of the plate as if it was an afterthought or a garnish. I feel bad admitting this but the best part of my brunch was actually the hash browns which were flavorful and crunchy. As for my friend's meal, she enjoyed it. <br><br>Overall I had convinced myself before arriving that I was really going to enjoy The Publican. But after spending $60 on brunch (with tip) for two people I was really disappointed. For my half of the bill I essentially got two poached eggs, some prosciutto, a serving of hash browns, and orange juice. If I had gone to a good greasy spoon anywhere else in the city I could have spent half that and gotten a hearty breakfast. The service was attentive and friendly but the food was just meh.

One of the dishes we had were very salty and not really edible. When sent back she was really nice about it and took it off our tab, although I wish we had another dish made for us we came alittle close to closing and I'm sure the kitchen was either closing or about too which I didn't mind just having it taken off our tab. <br><br>Typically I would not send food back but I do if the restaurant I'm going to is like the Publican. Previous Michelin star winners with plates starting off around the upper 20 to 40 range. It may sound snobby, but I do have alittle higher expectation when it comes to restaurants like these. I feel like when you come to a place like this, a lot of what you're paying for is the experience than the food so if the food is not made correctly than I do have a problem with that. Anyway onto the food before I go off on a rant here on yelp that you're not interested in...<br><br>We ordered several plates. Started off with the apple crisp which I could not tell you how it was because I am allergic to apples but it was the tables top 3 choice when talking about favorites. The sweet corn was, if not my personal favorite. Corn is corn but the way it was buttered along with the ingredients used to induce such flavor was delectable. The pasta tagliatelle was ok, all I tasted was vinegar but the texture of The pasta was perfect and well put together. The dry aged sirloin was scrumptious.....I love steak and although some at the table felt it was alittle too rare for their liking, I thought it was perfect and wonderfully seasoned. The farm chicken wasn't anything special, the chicken was dry and the sausage wasn't anything special. Also came with a bunch of French fries.....nothing special. My absolute favorite there was the pork belly, btw these are all pictured! Perfectly cooked, it had a nice crispy exterior and juicy interior that burst with flavor! This and the sweet corn would've been the perfect meal for me although the serving they gave you was pretty small. <br><br>Price is a bit steep but again it's the experience is mainly what you're paying for. Everything went well in my<br>Opinion except for the one pork dish we had to send back, some of the chicken from the half chicken was pretty salty too but it's definitely an experience!

Easily remedied with a touch of cream. <br><br>Ordered the chef selection dozen oysters, liver pate dish, biscuits with sausage gravy,  bacon, and dutch baby for something sweet. <br><br>1. Yes to Oysters. <br>Oysters came first. I can officially say I've had oysters in the Midwest and didn't die (I'm originally from the west coast so most thoughts of seafood in the Midwest makes me wary). Joking aside, a very good sampling of different oysters. Most were light and bright in flavor, but my favorite one was the Olympic miyagi groom Vancouver island. It was soother and richer than the others. That being said, I don't think I would have been able to handle more than a couple of those since they were richer than the rest. <br><br>2. Yes to bacon. <br>Their bacon is amazing! Being they were thick  cut the smoke flavor was still there while not being overly sweet with the glazing. Tender and not as heavy as I would have expected. <br><br>3. Mmm, too much<br>Liver pate was very flavorful, but I dare say too flavorful. There wasn't enough toast for how much pate there was, which made enjoying more than a few mouthful difficult. We used some of the oyster crackers with the pate. It needs some more unsalted bread to go with it. The pickled elements on top helped, as did the perfect soft boiled egg. <br><br>4. Yes to biscuits and sausage heavy. <br>Biscuit and sausage gravy had better balance in terms of overall flavor. They also garnish it with fresh mint, which was surprisingly pleasant as a flavor addition. Love an egg on my breakfast foods. <br><br>5. I'll pass on the Dutch baby next time.<br>Dutch baby was dryer than expected. Didnt have anything to moisten it other than the garnishes and toppings that were listed in the description. Mainly creme fraiche, raspberries, hazelnuts, and mint. There weren't any other wet elements. Outside was crisp tough, I'll give them that. Wish it wasn't so dry though.

Six microscopic slices of presumably high-grade fish floated on a shallow puddle of flavor that imbued the meat with light and delicate taste, but it wasn't nearly enough to warrant the $18 price tag. Luckily, we are corporate ballers, and expensed the whole shit anyway.<br><br>Now this chicken liver pâté, that was a whole different story. One of my compatriots is a connoisseur of the stuff, and having eaten pâté all over the globe, I was interested in his take, though not particularly excited to try it myself.<br><br>Bruh.<br><br>This shit was b-a-n-a-n-a-s!

I could tell you that my heart stopped long enough for me to be declared dead and then restarted on the next bite and that's how good it was, but I'm just gonna say it was fye and if you got it like that, you should give this wild ass Illinois beef a place at the table.<br><br>Keeping with the dry-age, we moved into the duck breast next, which was juicy, flavorful and didn't suffer from the heavy duck flavor you can sometimes get. It was perfectly fine and a good choice.<br><br>On the lighter end, and I wish it'd come out earlier, was the hake which was a standard fried fish scenario that came with a dipping sauce and some lemon. Some might say it was dressed up Long John Silver's I'm gonna say it was pretty delicious.<br><br>At the end of the meal came the crown jewel of this motherfucker: a king chicken hacked up cooked to perfection and perched on a throne of frites.

The rest of the food was either too salty (fried spring onions, asparagus), very bland (white looking sausage), or a poor blend of flavors (porchetta and also white looking sausage...) I will not even going into the details of the other dishes, as they were poorly executed and should not have money wasted on. For example, the fried spring onions were supposed to be \"tempura\" like, and yet it was oily and heavy as you would think of onion rings you get from the fair. It was very heavy and honestly I think a poor choice to give at the end of the meal.<br><br>What was even more demoralizing was the desserts. We received a mint chocolate chip ice cream. Though it had been made with real mint leaves and dark chocolate, It did not taste great together. A few bites sure, but we left the rest to melt. The second dessert we received was the chocolate cake with a smear of peanut butter... oh my goodness I do not even know what I was eating because it was so salty and the texture just did not work. It was even saltier than some of our main dishes. I would've preferred if they just trashed the dessert and given me an ice cream cone from McDonalds.<br><br>Though not something I considered for my rating of the restaurant, the decor and interior design of the place is interesting. I personally would not have boxed people into (they literally sit in a booth that the sides close on, nor would i have made long tables that make it difficult to work your way around and have to fight with your random neighbor you sit with. Though I would say it was intriguing nonetheless.<br><br>This is a restaurant that I would say looks great on paper, and even when reading the menu, but does not work out well in real life. They tried to made the dishes too innovative and in turn ruined the harmony that these dishes could have had. The pace of the food was also obscure. We received 5 dishes within the span of 10 minutes, and the last 2 had a 15 minute delay from when we finished the first 5. That is definitely a miscommunication or misstep somewhere.<br><br>For the price, I would highly recommend you walk 2 blocks south, and plead with the good people at Girl & The Goat for a standby spot. The food there is what good innovation and execution looks like. It is worth the money and you'll even save yourself a few bucks when you walk out full and happy.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nchfHpCNpsziH7L2JPQjBA/348s.jpg", "caption": "The mud pie.

I had this place and Blackbird bookmarked (same owner) but decided to give Publican a try for my friends birthday. Everything was coming to place, right when the Lyft dropped us off to putting our name on the list and then finally getting seated. It was like that episode all over again. <br><br>We came here around 7:45 and there was about an hour wait. They text you when your table is ready but I never got a text so around 9pm we showed up and voila, our table was ready for us. We were seated at the bar area, this place is pretty big but looked like it was hard to get a table since everything was full. I usually don't sit at the bar either but I was so excited to try this place that I didn't even care. <br><br>Once seated, that's where we met our awesome waiter Will. This guys great!! He offered so many suggestions and was super attentive throughout our meal. We ordered the chefs selection oysters, the spicy pork rinds, the striped bass, dry aged New York steak, fried quail and the half charcuterie plate. <br><br>What I love about Publican is that they change their menu daily. They also mention what farm their food is sourced from and they work with a set amount everyday. For instance, we ordered the dry aged steak but by the time we were seated, they only had a 21oz. Portion left. We also ordered two drinks, a Moscow mule and the \"legs that dance\" which has blackberry jam mixed in there, yum! <br><br>Overall, the food was presented very well and it looked just as good as it tasted. <br>Spicy pork rinds- perfectly crunchy and not too spicy <br>Oysters- Really fresh <br>Charcuterie- not bad, could've done without a few of the meats but overall a good starter <br>Striped bass- the sauce this fish was cooked in was to die for. Fish was super tender and it almost melted in your mouth <br>Fried quail- heavily breaded but very tender and the slaw they have on top is a must with the quail in every bite <br>Dry aged steak- Very tender but a salty for my liking <br><br>Overall, I'm glad I got to check this place off my list.

I loved reading the menu as it has a focus on fresh local vegetables and seafood... two of my favourite things plus an amazing dessert menu.  Clearly I was made to eat here!  Overall, the level of professional but warm service plus amazing dishes made it one of my places to eat.  The environment could be a bit quieter (it was LOUD) and the communal long table can strike up interesting conversation but also some side eye action from awkward interactions.  This is a small note compared to the amazing food coming out of the kitchen and the great service.<br><br>As mentioned, the service is great... we had a phenomenal server.  Not only he managed a LARGE group that had 3 kids beside us, he took care of us as if we were his only table.  Never once did we see him ignore us. His interest in the dishes was infectious ... he shared what he loved and didnt love as much.  He was very honest on what were the hits in his opinion and together we built a great order that I loved.  Another great thing about the service is the staff cleared each dish and the empty plates never sat more than a few minutes.  Our water was always topped and our server knew exactly when to talk to us to see how the meal was going and when to order.  Overall... just great.<br><br>We started with the bbq carrots (loved how they paired it with the pecans), tomato and burrata (my dining partner never had burrata before and he LOVED it.  The tomato had a vibrant flavour that paired well with the creaminess of the cheese), and hamachi crudo from Japan (this was good though it did seem a bit pricey for several small pieces but ... still very tasty).<br><br>We had 2 fish dishes and wow... they were great.  We ordered the sea bass and skate wing. We were hesitant on the skate wing cause our server said it came boned in.  I'm so glad we decided to go with it.  The sea bass was good but no where as excellent as the skate.  If you see skate on the menu... order it.  The meat comes off easily from the bones and whoever is doing the seafood in the kitchen... they are amazing.  Each fish was still tender and perfectly cooked and yet had a great sear on the skate.  <br><br>We ended the night with 2 desserts... blood orange sorbet and the deconstructed pavlova.  I love pavlova but their unique take had me scratching my head at first.  Still it was very good.  The blood orange sorbet though... oh that was very good.  Tangy, bright, and true to the fruit... it was just as good as the ones I've had in Italy.<br><br>Between the excellent skate, burrata and tomato dish, and blood orange... there was some definite highlights of the entire week.  With the incredible service, this made a clear winner for our week of dining.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sy1QUn-k2rntiCj0tTM6dQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "The blood orange is so true to the fruit!

I would come back just for these. They have a slight kick to them along with a delicious white cheddar season. Crispy, light, fantastical. <br><br>Chef's choice oysters - Great variety. Wish they could give some cocktail sauce and horseradish but I know, I know, it takes away from the flavor of the oyster, yada, yada, yada.<br><br>Cajun sausage - Pretty legit. Not a huge fan of sausage myself, but my friend loves sausage, so she devoured most of the plate. I really enjoyed the creamed corn sauce they drizzled on top. <br><br>Cuttlefish ink pasta - No go on this one. They offered to replace our dish because the pasta was SO SO SO SALTY. As in someone may or may not have spilled the entire contents of a salt container into making the pasta. They said it had something to do with the sauce reducing into the pasta throughout the night which may very well be true, but I feel like as far as quality control goes, it didn't make the cut. We didn't ask them to replace the dish since we were all so full and it was closing time. They did take the dish off the bill which I appreciated!<br><br>Overall, I love the atmosphere of this place.

They just don't need any Michelin star to be sooooooo good.<br><br>Publican as another successful venture of Paul Kahan, is a modern creative restaurant with solid options in seafood, pork and beers (recommend you to try their house-made beers while the cocktails are solid too). The space is big and open - high ceilings, big long communal tables inside and outdoor seating in the summer. Here are the highlights of our night:<br><br>Mussels - SO FAT!! Never had mussels this big! The sauce was a killer too. It was rich, super creamy, and buttery with delightful white wine aroma. Four of us couldn't help but want more bread just to finish the sauce! The bread was delicious too - crusty outside and warm inside. I have to confess this is the best mussel dish I ever had. You just have to try!!<br><br>Fried chicken - just the smell was driving me crazy... One bite - the crunchy sound and the burst of the flavor in my mouth made me forget about everything else... The meat inside is also flavorful and soft. Chewing them quickly released more flavors. The hot peppers and herbs also add nice kicks to the flavor!<br><br>Clams with squid ink pasta - another solid dish! Clams are huge as well. Very well seasoned with herbs and spices. The squid ink pasta is thick and chewy. Very satisfying texture yet also absorbed a lot of flavors.<br><br>Solid spot for food, drinks, and good vibes!

Maybe I just have simple taste and don't appreciate the finer details of each dish because everything was just alright for me. My initial impression of the Publican was that it was basically a tribute to pork and beer, so I was expecting the dishes to be very hearty with heavy, meat dominated flavors. <br><br>Food: One thing I love about going to a restaurant with a big group is that you can try a bite of a bunch of different things. So we pretty much ordered almost everything on the menu/<br><br>Publican mimosa - I was a little hesitant because I thought the beer would be heavy and dominate the flavor, but this was actually pretty refreshing. You still got the boozy orange juice flavor, but not quite as sweet, which I actually liked more. The beer was very subtle, and actually complemented well with the fruity flavor.<br><br>Pork rinds - I love pork rinds, and used to eat them all the time as kid since it's a popular Filipino snack. But something was just off about these. I liked the texture of the rinds, very light and airy and not dense/greasy at all. But that powder they dumped on top was a little weird. Some pieces were just covered in it and gave my mouth a dry, chalky feel. Not sure what was in it, but the flavor was way too tangy. I would've probably liked it better if they didn't sprinkle anything on top. <br><br>Waffle - Very light and airy...almost too much since it was to the point where it tasted like nothing. There wasn't any dominant flavor like vanilla in the waffle batter, and the honey butter was again too subtle in sweetness for me. <br><br>French toast - I'm more of a meat and potato guy, so I rarely order such fresh and fruity type breakfast items. Altogether though, I think the flavors worked well. Nice dense french toast as a base and then a very light creamy yogurt type sauce to bind everything together. It was topped with some nuts, peaches, and mint leaves. Overall a very refreshing bite. <br><br>Pork shoulder - Probably my favorite dish of the meal. This is what I was picturing most of the items on the menu to be like. Just like any dish served with eggs, I smashed it all together to spread that yolk around for every bite. It was topped with some chimichurri sauce and crispy fried onions. Great dish. <br><br>Frites - Basically normal fries with 2 fried eggs on top. I like fries, and I like eggs, but together it didn't create anything more than some plain fries sitting in a puddle of yolk. I feel like the fries needed any type of seasoning, and I needed something to bring it all together. There wasn't enough yolk to go around. Maybe some sort of dipping sauce like a garlic aioli would've helped.<br><br>Publican bacon - It's probably sacrilegious to not love this, but again I thought it was just aight. I swear I'm no bacon snob, but I thought Au Cheval's side bacon was way better. It was basically thick cut bacon with a little syrup drizzled on top. Some parts were too lean where it had a jerky type texture. Overall, not the melt in your mouth type experience I wanted from succulent pork belly.<br><br>Spoon bread - I wasn't exactly sure what this was. Was it a quiche? Was it some sort of savory cornbread? Either way, I thought it was surprisingly bland, especially since the menu said it contained bacon and parmesan cheese. <br><br>Cajun sausage - By the time this came out, I'm pretty sure I've already eaten 4 eggs haha. The sausage had a very subtle spice that tasted great. It also came with some grilled naan that was useful to soak up some of that egg yolk. Portion size was a little dainty though. <br><br>Overall, none of the dishes were terrible, but none were memorable enough for me to rave about to other people either. The waiter made it sound like we over ordered, since we got 5 dishes for 5 people along with a bunch of sides. But I definitely left hungry since a lot of the dishes were actually small and only a few bites, just dressed up with a lot of filler garnishes. Maybe it's because I had high/different expectations coming in, but I was slightly disappointed with Publican's brunch.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wvE7BFfAExTngv9UpmY6Hg/348s.jpg", "caption": "Pork rinds"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2Wg-o8IHHgCoK2hYm65xLg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Belgian waffle"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3iLQimbU-ZdVCGEibP4a7w/168s.jpg", "caption": "French toast"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Service and staff here were great, everyone is very knowledgeable about a menu that is constantly being changed and updated.

Prior to going I logged on to the website and reviewed the menu. My first thought was I don't like the offerings. Then I remembered this is Publican. If anyone can pull off such a bold menu, then this is the place. First off, they do everything from scratch. Yes, I do mean everything, the bread, preserves, butter, bacon, and the sausages. The last time I was in a restaurant that does this; I was in Indiana Amish country(Nappanee, Middlebury, Goshen, Shipswana). But just like everything else location, location, location. I live in Chicago and a trip out to the Amish is about 2.5 to 3 hours of driving. Also, don't expect a mimosa with your brunch in Amish country, which is a big minus with foodies like me. <br><br>We arrived and were welcomed by the friendly host, then quickly seated at our reserved booth. Tess our server was very nice and menu knowlegable. We started with delicious mimosas, a very good bloody mary, and a excellent Spanish cidra. Then, we ordered some very fresh tasting oysters. Which we followed up with Char scramble which was simply outstanding; the waffle with preserves and in house butter were addictive; some very good bacon and perfect breakfast sausage. The hashbrowns were some of the best I have ever had. The carrot cake with apricot preserves and cream cheese was very good. The carrot cake was good but it was the toppings that made it memorable. Last but definitely not the least, the excellent bread produced here is some of the best in the city. Top their excellent baguette with in house made nutella and you have a simple, yet delicious sweet treat. When you pay attention to the details it doesn't just make a difference. Rather, it makes all of the difference, and this meals proves that. Everything was simple, straight forward and delicious. <br><br>If you have not been here for brunch, then yes you are definitely missing out.

When he moved, a large farming family moved in and turned the beautiful space into an animal shed, where chickens made nests in the pool table and pigs lay on the expensive carpeted floors. <br>The Publican reminded me of that \"luxury office turned barnyard\" from my youth-- a confusing space that is partially upscale in its furnishings and prices yet somehow makes you feel like you're eating in a rustic feed lot. <br>Growing up on a farm, the enclosed booths looked like people (ironically) locked into in a feeding pen, and as a left handed person I really hated being squeezed at a large table with strangers, leaving me to wonder where we were all supposed to put those \"family style\", tapas sized entrees we were supposed to share. 90's music was blaring overhead a little too loudly and the menu didn't offer much besides pork dishes (the rustic paintings of pigs were the only decor on the walls, completing the ambiance that made me feel like I was in a 1990's Sizzler with an identity complex)... the restaurant or dining experience wasn't appealing at all, and I very much disliked the dishes we got-- the mussels were more fishy than I've had before, anywhere, and the lukewarm cauliflower salad, while decent enough, complemented nothing on the menu and was overpriced (around $14). <br>I should have read the reviews before going.... I asked my dining companion if we could please go elsewhere about 10 minutes after we arrived since I was really turned off by the decor, the lack of options on the menu, the strange seating (why did they cram us next to other diners when most of the communal tables were empty?) and the terrible blaring music.

Full disclosure, a close friend of my friend works here, and treated us to mini-mimosas and an olive oil cake to get started, and a good start it was indeed. The mimosas were translucent orange, which is the only way I think is right to serve a mimosa. We also ordered the spoon bread (temporary menu item) and the smoked Arctic char scramble, and I ordered a Bloody Mary. All was brought within a reasonable amount of time and our server was lovely. <br><br>The food was like heaven to my mouth. First of all, the olive oil cake (or loaf? I can't remember what it was called) was like a mild lemon bundt - not too sugary at all - with a lemon curd and like candied ginger or something on the plate. OMG I continued to die over this the entire time we were there and until the plate was cleaned. <br><br>(I've decided each of these food items deserves its own paragraph, so bear with me) My friend ordered the spoon bread because the server recommended it over the French toast, which is a menu staple. It came in this small cast iron skillet, and had a shredded brussel sprout slaw over it and it was divine. I admittedly didn't read the description on the menu, but whatever it said, it was amazing. Much more savory than I expected, just killer all the way around. <br><br>I had the Arctic char scramble which, I don't have much to say about due to its pretty simple composition, but I really enjoyed it. Delicious smoked Arctic char (tasted a lot like smoked salmon/smoked anything) with eggs and shallots and dill, served with toast. Yummy and filling for sure. <br><br>I also had the Bloody Mary (vodka version - they have a tequila version which I MUST try). It was the best bloody I've had in a long time if not ever. It had the perfect balance of spicyness, salty-vinegary-ness, and whatever else goes into a perfect Bloody Mary. Gah drooling thinking about it. So good, and had plenty of veg inside (I love to eat it). <br><br>Basically my soul was just as happy as can be enjoying that meal. We paid ~$30 a person before tip (not including the freebies) which I felt was surprisingly reasonable and definitely worth it. <br><br>I will be back, I can't wait to be back actually because I loved it so much.

In total we had the donut, sweet potato pound cake, bacon, and mushroom scramble. The sweets were delicious and came out quick and fresh. Really nice candies walnuts and whipped cream on the pound cake made that dish a winner. The bacon was as expected. Large pork belly that reminds me of a cut through ham, with a much stronger taste. Fantastic and must have addition to any brunch. The mushroom scramble was just a really good dish.

Chef Kahan's a compatriot of vaunted Philly chef Marc Vetri, likely rooted from being in the 1999 James Beard Award Best New Chef class. Kahan has a veritable Chicago empire with the lauded Black Bird, Avec, Publican Quality Meats, and of course, the Publican, just to name a few. The fact that other well-established chefs are using PQM meats for their menu speaks volumes; clearly the Kahan family's dedication to quality butchery and charcuterie is on point.<br><br>2014 George T. Stagg Antique Collection [$20]<br><br>I was able to enjoy a nice pour of the 2014 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection - Stagg to be exact. FYI - the 2015 collection is already popping up across the nation! This was quite the treat - straight out of the barrel, uncut, and unfiltered. Neat was the way to go, with smooth toffee notes that lent way to an ineffable sweetness, though with an undeniable kick that hits you to the back of your throat from the spice and the barrel-proof strength. On the finish, there were nice notes of fruit, coffee, and raisin.<br><br>Madai Snapper Crudo [$18]<br>Tsukiji Market madai, habazi spice, apple, mint<br><br>And with my first taste, I was sold. Snapper from Tsukiji? You can't fault the sourcing. Technique takes care of ensuring the snap and texture of the high-quality fish. But the true star for me? The crudo was incredibly seasoned. The salt really opened up the palate while also allowing you to taste the accents to the fish. The herbaceousness of the mint balanced the unoffending undertones of the Shabazzi oil, with the bright tartness of the apple really coming through on the forefront with a bit of acidity. I also appreciated how the Shabazzi coated the tongue - light and clean. Amazing.<br><br>Porchetta [$33]<br>Slagel Family Farm, roasted clams, corn, pea tendrils<br><br>The Publican is often described as pork paradise. I can see why. In addition to providing hefty portions of both the wrapped loin and the gorgeously unctuous yet crisped pork belly exterior, the accompanying elements to the dish were clearly carefully thought out. The Korean in me heard the call of bosam. I mean pork and bivalves? Yes, please! The sweet clams also had an innate salinity that accented the notes of sweet corn and hits of salt from the pork. The broth was light when compared to the rest of the dish, but also worked to heighten the heft of the dish especially when the cream sauce melded in. The potatoes were slightly crisp on the outside, but lent way to perfectly roasted innards.<br><br>The Publican - Porchetta<br><br>But in the end, it is all about that pork. The loin was moist and meaty. The belly portion? A contrast in crisp and gluttonous textures with everything I love about pork belly coming through. Admittedly, it might be a bit much for some and may be better shared. But for me, there was no sharing. From first bite to last, I knew I had a smile with each forkful. I am still talking about food, right?<br><br>How could I possible top the last bite? With the last dregs of BTAC Stagg of course, real deal whiskey sediment included. Happiness.<br><br>Butterscotch Pudding [$11]<br>Vanilla cream, cashew brittle, oatmeal cookies<br> <br>And for someone who doesn't have much of a sweet tooth, the extreme heft of the porchetta called for some sweetness to balance out the palate. So I went with their butterscotch pudding, which offered light vanilla, which was a nice countervailing element to the nice hits of sweet and salty cashew toffee brittle. The pudding itself was the pure essence of butterscotch, with some levity. The oatmeal cookies had great texture and were incredibly buttery. Milk was needed. But instead ...<br><br>Kyle's \"After Pork\" Digestif [$9]<br><br>For obvious reasons, I opted to try chief mixologist Kyle's \"after pork\" digestif. Benny was kind enough to comp the easily quaffable concoction, which featured Cynar, dark rum, Chartreuse, and mint. With the rum providing a sweet substantive foundation, the light bitterness from the artichoke and herbal liquers made for a refreshing end to the meal. Very nice. <br><br>Not only does the Publican have a strong pork program (that obviously extends to the rest of their menu!), but they also make sure to have high quality drinks and beers on offer. How many places do you know that have BTAC and Van Winkle 12 Year Special Reserve on hand this late in the season? And while the food and drink at the Publican is top notch, it's the service will earn my reco as the spot to go to if you're in need of the former.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BoKApsFzeFkh9X_A9a8XbA/348s.jpg", "caption": "Kyle's \"After Pork\" Digestif"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/k8lNNphHfBD1IAuYo2TXvA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Last Dregs of the 2014 George T Stagg Antique Collection"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/O93Kb26ctENNbBAAf_6UuA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Butterscotch Pudding"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "3 stars, for dinner.

The grilled sour cream pound cake was also quite good, although I found the creme fraiche ice cream didn't add anything and sort of took away from the rest of the dish. The fried quail was maybe two bites of meat, although the Texas-toast style bread and bed of corn were quite good (I probably would have been much more a fan of that dish if it had been called elotes and Texas toast!). <br><br>On the more disappointing side, the spicy pork rinds were a let down. They were not particularly spicy and the spices did not seem to reach the rinds further down in the cup at all. They also tasted a bit stale, so they wound up mostly being crunchy flavorless calories. Also disappointing were the other bread sides - the butter tasted like when you'd get at the grocery store, and the date and mint spread mostly just tasted like tomato sauce. <br><br>I rounded up a star because our server was great.

We had 9 o'clock reservations on a Saturday night and ended up waiting an extra 10 or so minutes because the table was finishing up dessert. The patrons I watched coming in were a bit older and wore fur (fur hats, shawls, coats)... Did I not get the memo? We were seated in a booth that was enclosed by short barn doors. I was delighted by the doors because the Publican is definitely a crowded place and it prevented anyone from bumping into to me. We had planned in advance to get the Chef's selection ($65) because going here was a one time deal and might as well maximize it. <br><br>That night's chef selection came with <br><br>Spicy pork rinds $6: 5/5 stars. They are so freaking good and addicting. The pork rinds were light, crunchy and had some sort of powder on them (methinks cocaine) which made the already delicious snack even better. <br><br>Beets (quark, flax seed, walnut & tahini dressing) $13: 5/5 stars. easily my favorite dish of the night. The beets were incredibly fresh and the dressing on them elevated them to amazing omg I need more beets in my life status. <br><br>Oysters $12?: 6/5 stars Hands down the best oysters I've ever had. The mignonette was delightful and served to enhance the flavor. <br><br>Fried sweet potatoes (spiced honey, hazelnut & labneh) $12: 5/5 stars. Slather honey on any fried honey and baby I'm in heaven. They weren't greasy and it tasted like curry potatoes but OMG were they good. <br><br>Sirloin (muhammara, date, sumac & feta) $21: 4.5/5 stars. My piece was an end piece which made it a little chewy but the second piece was tender and delicious. The pomegranates were a nice touch. <br><br>Roasted squash (fromage blanc,cherry, marcona almond & crispy sunchoke) $12: 3.5/5 stars. This wasn't very memorable nor was it my favorite. Felt like a filler dish and I wouldn't go out of my way to order it again. <br><br>Striped bass (buttermilk, leek & shabazi spice) $28: 4.5/5 It was so good! I love pungent fish and boy was this right up my alley. The leeks were delicious as was the sauce. It's not for anyone who likes it mellow and light and flaky. <br><br>Duck hearts (pepper jelly, boursin cheese, persimmon & multigrain toast) $14: 4.75/5 stars. The toast was really hard to slice through but it had a nice toast when biting into it. Duck hearts are so good, where have you been all of my life. <br><br>Porchetta (fig, treviso, pecorino & hazelnut picada) $33: 4/5 stars. The pork was fatty and tender a top a really yummy au jus. I would definitely order this again but was it in no way shape or form adequate as a single entree. *note the entrees should have ended here by the server noticed my sad, hungry face. <br><br>Bouchot mussels (publican lambic, bay,celery, butter & garlic) $16: 3.75/5 stars. This was an additional dish provided since my squad and I were still hungry. The mussels were tender and not chewy. The broth was really nice and light; it was the perfect vehicle for the delicious bread provided on the side. <br><br>Pumpkin cake (brown butter ice cream pomegranate & pear) $12: 5/5 stars. My favorite desert of the night. The ice cream was to die for. The pumpkin cake was light and fluffy and the sauce they smeared on the plate increased the pumpkin flavor. Definitely order this if you want a new spin on the oh so basic pumpkin flavor. <br><br>Ice cream bombe (chocolate, peanut butter, pretzel & caramel) $12: 4.25/5 stars. It would be 5 stars if the peanut butter ice cream wasn't so salty. The peanut butter ice cream was covered in a hard chocolate shell with a caramel drizzle on the plate and chocolate covered pretzels sprinkled on top. The caramel was perfect and my favorite component of the dish. <br><br>Service: 5/5 stars. The wait staff changed out our plates after every other dish and my water was never more than 3/4 empty. The server herself was having a rough night because the look of exhaustion was evident on her face but nonetheless she was great and accommodating. <br><br>The dishes were great but really small (i.e. tapas size). Every tasting was promptly followed by a \"omg this is so good. \" I don't think you can go wrong ordering anything here but I would check with the server to see if the portion is adequate as a entree instead of a petite appetizer size. If you're hungry, go for the chicken and sausage with frites. I spied other tables ordering it and seemed like the only substantial sized dish. Overall I don't consider the chef's selection the best value and I would probably order a la carte in the future ($65 a person but the value came out to $47 pp). The meal was supposed to end at the porchetta but server picked up on our sad hungry faces and decided to throw in the mussels.

I've never eaten a chicken that has such strong flavor (i'm not talking about overly salty), but also you can taste the herbs within the chicken. It was also amazing how juicy this chicken is.

The skin was impossible to cut through and it was really salty without anything add on to it.<br>The fries was good though. Mushy inside but crispy out.

You could easily have each person in your party order your own dish and not share with the table, it just might not come out at the same time. <br><br>Drinks:<br>This was probably the biggest disappointment of the meal. I started with the Moody Tongue saison which was a good pick for a refreshing beer on a hot day, with a nice kick of lemon. Next I ordered an Apex Predator, but the waitress came back a few minutes later saying that they were out of it. She offered up another saison/farmhouse ale that they had on tap so I happily agreed to that without investigating it much. Turns out I really should have because they charged $12 for the beer and it was only 5% abv, which is quite low for a saison. I have no idea how they justify charging $12 for that beer, it was very average. I don't mind paying for a high quality beer, especially when it has a higher abv, but this was absurd.<br><br>Appetizers:<br>Charcuterie - We got the half order which was plenty for the two of us to have a tasting of several kinds of meats. The lamb salami was good, but cut so thin you didn't get a whole lot of taste from it. Pork pie was pretty bland and had more bread than meat. The head cheese was good, and not as \"funky\" as I thought it might be. The foie gras and blood pate was strangely plain and lacking flavor - I expected it to be quite rich flavorful but it just tasted like bologna. The morteau sausage was easily the best on the plate, and it had a nice snap, great flavor, and was a little spicy. <br>Oysters - We ordered 6 east coast oysters and enjoyed all of them. However, they could do a better job shucking them as we had to crunch down on some bits of shell/sand which is never pleasant. <br><br>Entrees and sides:<br>Bouchot Mussels - We got the half order and that is more than enough for a group of 2-4 to share as the pot was huge and the individual mussels were very large. The broth was amazing and it came with a large piece of bread to soak it all up. If you like mussels, I highly recommend this dish. <br>Beef Tongue- Hands down the best thing we ate here. I am not what I would call a \"foodie\" that is used to eating things like this, and I LOVED it. Once you get past the idea that you are eating a tongue, the flavors and textures are outstanding. This dish is well prepared with great sauce/spices and the meat itself is cut into small cubes. It almost has the look and feel of a beefy ham. Do yourself a favor and order this. <br>Barbecue carrots - Quite good for a side dish, and the barbecue/smokey taste was VERY prevalent. They taste like they are cooked over a bonfire.  <br><br>Overall I would come back for the food, and not the drinks. I might try the chef's selection for dinner which gives you 8-10 courses for $65pp.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Where do I begin. We made reservation and were seated upon arrival.

However, I am a little salty because I ended up eating one of the best dishes I have had in a while there, the duck breast. <br><br>The duck breast dish. Perfectly cooked. Duck with persimmon. Not a combination I knew went together like cookies and milk. The incorporation of the persimmon into the sauce as a sort of reduction was the icing on the duck. I might have to stalk their menu and hope they revist this dish and make the trip back to Chicago just to try it again.<br><br>Not to say that the other dishes weren't amazing, because they were. <br><br>The spicy pork rinds came out first and my attempts to stop eating them so I could save room for the rest of the feast were futile. Even the classic \"put it out of your reach\" method didn't work. <br><br>The mackerel came whole and had just the right amount of char-grilled flavor. <br><br>The charcuterie sated my charcuterie desire. I do wish they offered a greater variety of mustard.  But that's just a minor gripe.<br><br>Do yourself a favor.

I don't hesitate to put my experience at The Publican in the Top 5 all-time dining experiences of my life. It was an incredible meal and the service was impeccable. <br><br>My girlfriend and I are visiting and on two separate occasions while we were making our way to Chicago via L.A. and Mexico we ran into local foodies. In both cases when we asked about where to have a great meal these locals recommended Publican, so we were feeling pretty good about it before we even got there and knew we had to check it out. Our reservation was for 8:00 on Monday. It was busy but they lovely hostess was able to quickly accommodate our request for a table on the patio.<br><br>Our waitress Tess was so genuine, friendly, and professional. Even though it was busy she made it seem almost effortless as she took time with us and coursed our meal perfectly. The wine list is interesting and there are a number of northern and eastern European varietals that  I was not familiar with. Tess asked us what wine characteristics we liked and then brought us an amazing Hungarian wine that was, delicious, full-bodied and PERFECT for our meal. We were really impressed by the coursing of the food, and clearly the priority was for us to savor our meal as opposed to the usual (if sometimes subtle) strategy of most restaurants to \"turn\" tables. As It started to get a little chilly outside Tess went in and borrowed a sweater from the aforementioned lovely hostess for my gf so we could stay at our sweet patio table... incredibly thoughtful. She was also expertly backed up by the super-charismatic and super-helpful assistant manager Kevin who initially took our drink and oyster orders and checked in with us throughout our meal.<br><br>We had beautiful, fresh, crisp oysters and clams, a llittle gem salad, chicken liver paté, a delicious marinated eggplant dish with crispy shallots, and an an incredibly savory pork belly entrée with grits, peach, basil vinaigrette & pepita. Every bite was a flavor explosion. I should also mention that the \"o-mi\" mezcal cocktail was really nice and not overly sweet which I always appreciate. I guess the menu changes almost daily but if our meal is any indication then I would say that you can't make a bad choice here.<br><br>The ambiance is definitely lively and busy. It's not fancy but it has the feel of a crafted dining experience. I loved the beer taps and the amazing beer selection as well and when we completed our meal and things started slowing down for the restaurant we lingered at the bar for another hour. We spent most of that time talking to Tess and Kevin who came over just to hang out with us, buy us a beer, and talk about life, Chicago, L.A., etc. What a great evening.

We've enjoyed a few good meals so far, including one morning at the Publican.<br><br>Knowing how popular it is, we called ahead and were told we couldn't make reservations; yet, when we showed up, they asked if we had a reservation. What the heck?? They let us come in anyway, brought us to the area with bar-style tables, and quoted us a 30-minute wait. We were OK with that. Thirty minutes of awkward standing went by and we hadn't heard anything. Finally, one of us approached the front desk and asked what was up. Apparently they forgot about us. Le sigh. They quickly offered us a table available immediately as long as we were able to clear out within an hour for a later reservation. Whatever. We took the table because we didn't have any other option.<br><br>We sat at the end of the communal table, right where it connected with a second table going in a different direction. Slightly awkward. The communal tables are interesting.

And what's the reason for the little doors on the booths? Why do they get to be separated??<br><br>Anyway -- the brunch menu looked scrumptious, albeit a bit pricey. I ordered a coffee and a dish with grilled asparagus, egg, and fish. The coffee was fine. My dish was phenomenal. Despite my efforts to cut small pieces and savor every bite, it was quickly devoured.

For the past 5 years, my partner at work has done nothing, but rant and rave about this place and how amazing it is. I mean he literally could be their employee because he speaks of it so much. Being that he is a food loving guru who should host his own show at times, my other coworker and I decided to try it out and see why it is that this man rants and raves about this place. Needless to say we are still pondering the answer to that as tonight I can assure was my first and last time at this location. Allow me to begin with what we ordered:<br><br>Appetizer: <br>Squash- this was pure heaven and the only thing on the menu I'd like to think we would order this again.<br><br>Dinner:<br><br>1/2 Farm Chicken- it fell off the bone which was nice. It came with fries that were well cooked and crispy. While they praise themselves on everything being grown local, the fries tasted like something out of a frozen bag. I just had to wonder, was grown local, frozen local, and was the packaging just as local?<br><br>Pork Belly- we ordered this because they don't serve the glazed bacon during dinner hours, only brunch, and let me tell you what a mistake this was. The Pork Belly was nothing but fat and dry meat. More fat than meat though and the size was nuts for the price! We wondered how this little thing was supposed to feed two people? Maybe if we wanted to eat the fat it would. We were definitely not impressed with this one. <br><br>Country Rib- this was far from a rib! It was extremely undercooked and was impossible to cut. The flavor was more on the sweet side and it was so chewy that I felt like I was chewing gum. In the end my friend and I decided that my two boxer mixes would enjoy eating this more than we would as they would be able to handle it. I'm sorry, but the moment it becomes better for my dogs than me, it's a MAJOR problem. They like princes, but I'm the only one who get to eat like a Queen. <br><br>Dessert: <br><br>Waffle with a Cheesecake Napoleon ice cream- we enjoyed the waffle a lot as it was just the right texture. As for the ice cream, they make it themselves, and I tasted no cheesecake in it. Definitely not impressed with the ice cream. Waffle yes, ice cream no. <br><br>Bavarian- we both loved the Bavarian. It was the perfect texture and the perfect dessert. It shared the same texture as a mousse and was simply lovely. <br><br>Drink:<br>Lemonade- When you think of lemonade you think of sweet. This is not the case here, this lemonade is carbonated water and has real lemon it which made it so sour. I drank it even though I hated it because it was $3. No refills, not saying that I would have done it would they have offered them anyways or did they? I was to afraid to ask. <br><br>Atmosphere: <br><br>The restaurant was loud, had us screaming across the table, and listening into others conversations. It was nearly impossible for us to talk to each other. Think of a high school cafeteria with kids screaming and loud music trying to hide their screams. That's what eating here was like. Not only this, but I deal with Chronic back pain and the chairs were beyond uncomfortable. It was like sitting on the ground. I actually had to take an additional pain killer because the pain was that bad. If the food was better the pain would have been worth it, but it wasn't. <br><br>Not only were we unimpressed, but we are still trying to wrap our heads around the fact that the bill was so high when the food tasted so low. Definitely not on my places to eat for dinner again, but hey maybe we caught them on a bad night.<br><br>I will say though that I would be willing to try this for breakfast and lunch as the photos look delicious, but dinner is a no go for me.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Love this place.

It is large homestyle and every dish is very centered around a single item, and they are all heavy decadent dishes. I think the menu and each dish in particular would truly benefit from a little more balance. They lack a bit of freshness and lightness to just compliment the fattiness and sweetness of some the dishes overall.  I am not going into the details of each individual dish as I have been here many times and this is more of a composite review.<br><br>Overall this is a very solid restaurant and I do enjoy returning here.

Would HIGHLY recommend the first three:<br>- (something) skate: a ray fish. Definitely our favorite. Powerful flavors, and really fun how it's brought out. The kitchen server removes the cartilage from the center of the meat right at the table. We tried it because we thought, \"Ray fish? When do you get to eat a ray fish?\" And we were pumped we took the risk because it was awesome. <br>- beef tongue: really interesting mix of flavors. The fresh herbs really bring this one home. Barely comes in second to the ray fish. <br>- potted rillettes: a mix of duck and pork belly I believe, mixed with blueberry jam and served with dang good sourdough bread. Brought out first as an app, and won us over immediately.<br>- Roasted cauliflower. Server recommended this and the avocado salad from the vegetable list. My girlfriend actually liked this more than the beef dish, and while I liked it, it didn't wow me.<br><br>At the end, our server brought out a little butterscotch dessert with a candle on it for my girlfriend, on the house.

The space is an eclectic amalgamation, part European beer hall and part farmhouse-tavern, thanks to its lengthy communal tables, the wooden, high-ceilinged architecture, and the ever-clamorous atmosphere.<br><br>Although we'd easily made reservations in advance for that Saturday morning, some last minute confusion caused us to cancel them, even though we eventually wound up arriving for the meal that we'd initially planned for. Thankfully, the hostess was able to offer us seats at the bar, which actually wound up being more of a kitchen counter; I couldn't complain about the chance to see the staff in action, as dishes were continuously expedited throughout our meal.<br><br>While I typically go for savory plates for my weekend meals, I couldn't help but order the Brioche French Toast. It was an impressive plate, consisting of two generous slices of french toast, drizzled with a whiskey-infused apple syrup, pecan butter, and whipped marscapone, with the much-needed dusting of confectioner's sugar. The texture of the bread was spot-on, featuring a soft, slightly moist center with a well-crisped, almost caramelized crust. It wasn't overly sweet, and the additional elements worked in tandem together, with the marscapone contributing a much-needed lightness to each bite. I was able to try a few bites of the Pork Schniztel, which had a hearty portion of lightly breaded pork loin paired with two fried eggs, fingerling potatoes, and an appreciative dab of mustard. It's the kind of hearty, filling food you'd crave after a night of too much drinking, although it's delicious even when in a sober state of mind.<br><br>Unfortunately, I probably won't get a chance to return to The Publican for a second meal, but I wouldn't doubt the strength of their dinner options. The venue is perfect for almost any occasion, from a weekend brunch, to a late night pick-me-up, and the food offered is unpretentious, reasonably priced, and well executed.

It's a nice talking point and got us to try tasting the nuances of the regions. Gem salad was crisp and delightful, and the pork rinds were excellent. The pork dish didn't really stand out - albeit very tasty. The best dish of the night was the fish, which tasted very fresh with a lot of bold flavors.

Well, that doesn't apply to The Publican, as it definitely lives up to the hype.<br><br>Came here for brunch on a Sunday after making reservations the night before. The restaurant was packed (as expected), and we were seated at the communal tables (which I love). My friends and I were starving, so we definitely did not hold back when ordering. We ordered:<br><br>-Bloody mary (w/ a Fist City pale ale accompaniment): the bloody mary here definitely packs some heat! It's not as thick or salty as other bloody mary's, so it's different in that sense. The beer accompaniment (your choice) is a nice touch.<br><br>-Chef's selection of oysters: fresh and nicely shucked (no pieces of broken shells were in any of the oysters)<br><br>-Chicken liver pate: if you're a pate lover, this is a must get. The texture isn't thick like most pate's; it has more of a mousse-y texture, which made it easy to spread and, I think, added to the amazing taste. Very smooth w/ a great, rich taste.<br><br>-Frites w/ fried eggs: the fries were good, but nothing mind-blowing. Definitely can skip this side if you're on the fence about it.<br><br>-Spicy pork rinds: absolutely fantastic! Crunchy, yet still light and airy. They were dusted w/ a powder that was salty and sour, but delicious (it reminded me of a ranch dressing powder). Highly recommended, especially if you like pork rinds.<br><br>-Maple syrup-braised bacon: HEAVEN. I like to think of myself as a bacon connoisseur (I've definitely had my fair share), and I must say that this is one of the best I've ever had (best I've ever had, best I've ever had...shout out to Drake). The bacon is thick, tender, and has an amazingly sweet (but not too sweet) flavor thanks to the maple syrup. This is soooo good that I think my vegetarian friends would convert if they tried it. I'm pretty sure the old school song \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)\" by the Eurythmics is referring to the bacon at The Publican.<br><br>-Pork schnitzel: huge pieces of pork that are crispy and delicious. The aioli is great, too. A very good dish that comes in a big portion, so if you're hungry, definitely get this.<br><br>-Smoked sablefish: the fish is soft and buttery. Another phenomenal dish, as the spatzle, snap peas, celery root, creme fraiche and poached egg all work great together w/ the sablefish. Make sure to mix everything up so you get all the yumminess in one bite! The presentation of this dish is beautiful, too.<br><br>-Crab scramble: great flavor, and the eggs are scrambled to perfection - soft, fluffy, and not rubbery at all. I prefer my eggs sunny side up or fried, but I would definitely get this dish again.<br><br>There's also an extensive beer menu. My friends all agreed that this was a HELLA GOOD meal (excuse my NorCal-ness). The Publican is one of the best restaurants in Chicago, as the 2k+ reviews can attest.

Sadly, the porchetta was sold out during our visit; thus we had to opt for the mussels instead. The mussels had very generous servings and tasted above the standard boring mussels from other restaurants. Country rib was superb while in my opinion the dry aged sirloin felt like a salad dish with some small chunks of sirloins being sprinkled here and there as a decoration.

The food was so-so and the service was not good. I went with a group of 6 for a large, bossy brunch! Drinks, Oysters, Starters, Main Courses and Desert... we tried it all.<br><br>FOOD: The oysters were enjoyed, they had good flavors, but were served at room temperature. The Pecan Sticky Bun (sounds amazing right) was underwhelming, it was dry in the middle and not as sugary as I would've liked. However, the Bacon, amazing - thick chunks of porkbelly cooked to perfection - it's chewy/fatty and meaty/crunchy - the best thing we ate by far and worth the $7. The baguette was well a baguette, we did expect homemade jelly and ended up getting something from a jar.<br><br>The Mushroom Toast was a favorite at the table, 2 ordered it and both enjoyed the mushroom topping, however neither finished the hunk of bread. I had the smoked pork shoulder - the grits were good, the pork was dry (whomp) and my egg was over cooked - sunny side up means a runny middle and it was hard. The coffee is good and they have whole raw chunks of sugar on the table for it. I also enjoyed the mimosa!<br><br>SERVICE: The waiter we had took forever to fill up our coffees and waters. She kept forgetting things like lemons for the oysters and hot sauce for the food, extra forks. She seemed very annoyed with our table ordering different things - usually the more you order the better!

The chicken sandwich was large and flavorful, the salmon looked good although I didn't get to try it.<br><br>The bad: Service is prompt but completely lacks any customer engagement. We had 4 servers assist us and I don't think one actually smiled when we tried to engage them with a thank you. It felt robotic  and as if we were bothering them. This may all be because of it being an airport restaurant but should that really matter? I also have an expectation for all airport bars to be able to make a handful of standard drinks drinks very well, a Bloody Mary is one of those staples. However, I sent my Bloody Mary back because it was all horseradish and vodka, nothing like it should have been.

I can see how one might not fancy blood sausage and beef tongue, but even the most basic entrees were presented with local and quality ingredients that are more than enough to impress a date and/or visitors. <br><br>Let's cut to the chase and present to you what our party of deux had: fermin serrano, spicy pork rinds, English peas, black back flounder, and porchetta. That respectively equates to three appetizer-type dishes and two entrees. Did we overdo it? Yes, but worry not, we took the leftovers to go and not a crumb was put to waste.<br><br>Of the five, I highly recommend three. The fermin serrano is a rich, wild, Spanish ham with a fair amount of fat. The flavors were bursting when paired with the rye bread and goat cheese based butter. The butter was such a delicacy that I outright said I will eat it by itself. The flounder can be ordered in three sizes: small, medium, and large. Our small was surprisingly big. At approximately one foot long, measuring from the tip of the head to the tail, and perhaps six inches wide, it was more than enough. The server was considerate and helped us filet the fish by removing the bone. It was an impressive entree with the tasso ham, fava bean, green bean, potatoes, and lemon aioli in the ingredient mix. The seasoning were strong without covering the fish itself's natural flavors. But my favorite must go to the porchetta which is essentially five slabs of pork loin made with summer squash and stratiacella. The squash shied away from the sprinkled cheese's blatant presence, but the flavors were well-marinated into the braised pork leaving it especially refined and tender. Likewise, I really enjoyed how each slab had a thin rim of fat clinging to it.<br><br>And let's not forget we also had two other items. The spicy pork rinds are great for sharing among a group of four. For two people, we felt compelled to finish it on the spot. Each bite came with a loud crunch because they were so crispy. The crisp would have been foregone if we didn't finish it in one sitting. Therefore, they are very good to snack on but [group] size matters. The English peas were not what we had in mind. It was very tangy and spiced with the heavy usage of cheese, horseradish, and lemon. I felt like we were scooping yogurt even though it was a snack of peas.   <br><br>With all that said, a return is perceived.

I was thrilled to find out they take reservations (there's nothing I hate more on a cold Chicago morning than being forced to stand in a vestibule with a line of other people as the door keeps opening and closing!), and I made ours for 10:00, when they open on Sunday.<br><br>We had a bit of trouble finding parking (I thought it would be easier directly in front, esp. so early, but we had to circle once before finding something about a block away) so arrived about two minutes late. No problem- we were seated promptly, and were shown to a two-top near the front window. We were really happy to see that the person bringing water also had coffee and cream was already on the table, so we didn't even need to wait for our waitress before diving into a large, steaming mug. We ordered: red wine poached eggs, a waffle, bacon, and shared the coffee cake.<br><br>My husband had the poached eggs, and he liked the prosciutto and the arugula salad, but mentioned that he didn't find the wine-poaching added flavor, although it did turn the egg white the color of red wine. No complaints, but I don't think he'd order it again. The waffle was less good. It was light and crispy on the outside and heavily coated in powdered sugar. Blueberry jam and butter came on the side. The butter had a strange flavor and color (pretty translucent)...we actually were wondering if it was lard before I double checked the menu and saw that it was honey butter. It did have a sweet note but did not taste like butter- I made the mistake of slathering the waffle in it before tasting it and then needed to remove it after I tasted it. The bacon was, as predicted, a true highlight. My husband claimed it was one of the top bacon experiences in his life, and I agree. Definitely get it! We decided to share the coffee cake for dessert and I was not disappointed. I was a bit worried based on the waffle, but I shouldn't have been: this was light, moist, and had a nice crumbly topping. If you like sweet, non-eggy breakfasts, I'd recommend getting this for your main instead of the waffle.<br><br>I'd be interested in going back for dinner or to the deli, as I found the meat to be the highlight of the meal, but that'll teach me not to go to a butcher and order a waffle.

When we got there at 10am, the entrance was full of people who all had reservations and I was a little intimidated at the popularity of this place. I also did not love the whole communal seating bit. Next time, I want to sit in one of those fun booths that have doors on them. Communal seating aside, the rest of the place is awesome. Tall ceilings with very cool lighting, a giant bar along one entire wall, tiny waiting tables in the middle of the restaurant and an exposed kitchen.

Well not really. But we got a lot of food. And it was everything I had hoped for.<br><br>We started with a dozen oysters, the chefs selection. I have never had oysters before and was a little pensive, but they were DELICIOUS. They arrived with lemon wedges and a tangy mignonette. The cape cod oysters were my favorite. We easily could have ordered a dozen more.

They were dusted in a delicious seasoning, but the texture was weird and they were kind of heavy and greasy for being so light and puffy. The schnitzel was SO GOOD. Easily my favorite item on the table. the breading was crisp and flavorful, the eggs cooked so very over easy that the yolks quickly spilled over the schnitzel, accompanied by soft creamy potatoes pieces. It was enormous and so, so good. The bibimbap was great, I don't love kimchi but the flavors all worked together and the pork belly was delicious. My crab scramble was actually my least favorite entree, which isn't saying anything terrible because everything was so good. I did love that it was served with thick hearty toast pieces which i summarily used to scoop up the scramble to eat. The avocado was a nice light touch atop the scramble and the crab was plentiful. The sticky bun and donut were both delicious and so decadent. <br><br>All of us had coffee and one of us had a mimosa, and our total was $142 before tip.

Two seafood plates were probably the highlight of the meal--the albacore escabeche and the yellowtail. The albacore was wonderful and unique, the fish lightly cooked in some combination of acid and oil, served with sliced plum, a heap of vegetables, and a coriander vinaigrette. The yellowtail was fully cooked, a preparation I don't come across too often. It was a delicate, flavorful piece of fish, served with red goddess, chimichurri, cherry tomato, and pumpkin seed.

The first to arrive was the beets dish that had a nice balance of acid and sweet and a flavor profile that was different enough from the usual beet/goat cheese combo to make it worthwhile.

We also got the pork rinds: surprisingly light and not greasy, a fun order but sort of superfluous. Then the mackerel with lentils which came whole and delicious! Too bad it was pretty much reserved for the pescatarian in our group and I could only take a bite for tasting. Next arrived the tongue dish, which was probably the dish we liked the least: too many competing flavors, even if the tongue itself was cooked to perfection. And finally country rib and pork chop. Both good. I liked the chop better, but others at the table preferred the rib. I'd order the chop again, but would probably try the sirloin instead next time. And after everything came the wild mushroom dish, that was honestly quite forgettable.<br><br>Up to here the dinner was close to 5 stars. Then we ordered dessert. Those were definitely not 5 stars. For us they were probably 0 stars, but I guess there was a bit of a taste issue there. However, even without the taste issue, desserts lacked the balance of flavors of the other dishes. We got the pavlova and the pot the creme and the had a similar flavor profile that was overwhelmed by peanuts, cardamom and caramelized sugar. With one dessert reminding us of melted smokers and the other of pumpkin spice latte with caramel. Now even if that was my jam, I'd expect a little more restraint and subtleness from a restaurant at this level.<br><br>Also, the wine/alcohol selection was not great.

The food. So many amazing options to choose from. We settled on the squash, mussels, taste of three hams, and the striped bass. All were amazing and would suggest them all.

Almost everything about the restaurant was underwhelming. <br><br>My only compliment to the restaurant is that the valet guy was awesome and thought it was hilarious that I valeted my sh!tty toy-sized rental car. <br><br>THE FOOD: I love that the ingredients are consciously sourced, but that's about it. Everything we tried was overseasoned or overcooked. There was no balance to the food or chance to cleanse the palette because every dish was trying to be the star. Maybe we didn't order right, but it would have been nice to have something to break up the onslaught of flavors.

The accompanying sausage was the worst sausage I have ever eaten, and that includes processed garbage served in Lunchables. <br><br>THE SERVICE: The service was slooooooow. There is no reason a dinner for three should take 2.5 hours. It's unacceptable to wait 10 minutes to place a drink order or 25 minutes to get a check.  <br><br>I went to the bathroom to wash my hands before eating and I had to dodge several employees who wouldn't move out of my way. That sounds elitist and terrible, but the first thing I learned working in restaurants is that it's common courtesy to not hold up people who are paying to dine in your establishment. <br><br>THE ATMOSPHERE: Douchey. <br><br>They're trying to hard to create a casual environment with farm-syle food! The feeling I got from the Publican is that they think the way everyone eats, socializes, and goes to the bathroom is wrong.... and we should all be thankful they're here to show us the correct way. <br><br>I get the family-style service, but the tables were too narrow to fit everything comfortably. I had to move my glass over to the left side of my plate, and the stranger next to me almost drank from it. The menus were way too large to fit on the table, which is ridiculous since the expectation is that you order as you go.<br><br>The architect/designer failed the owner miserably in the execution of the concept.

Maybe I'm old school, but I don't want a large unisex bathroom with dim lighting. I want privacy! I get the whole \"communal\" thing, but the bathroom is too much. The circular trough sink is a creative concept, but the concessions made for that feature are ridiculous. The bathroom mirrors ended up being directly over the toilet, and that's the last place I want break out makeup or eye drops when out for an evening. <br><br>The bathroom's communal sink is not handicapped accessible, and neither are the individual stalls at first glance.

It's both casual and clever, kind of like the food. <br><br>We started with the Yellowtail Crudo, which was simply dressed with citrus, olive oil, pine nuts, and mint. It was wonderfully fresh and a great way to begin our meal. Then we moved on to half a Charcuterie Plate, which was very good with the exception of the cold and mediocre pork pie. I did love the variety of pickled vegetables, however. When it comes to charcuterie, you can never have enough pickles.<br><br>Next was the Country Fried Egg, which was outrageously delicious. The crispy fried exterior gave way to a perfectly runny boiled egg inside. Accompanied with grilled asparagus, it was a clever riff on a classic dish. The final entree was, of course, the Pork Belly, a huge and tender slab of porcine indulgence coated in a sweet and savory glaze. I felt like a total pig devouring it, but hey, you are what you eat.<br><br>All this meaty goodness was washed down with an amazing pale ale called Zombie Dust by Three Floyds Brewing in Indiana. Hoppier than most pale ales, it ranks up there as one the top 5 beers I have ever had. Just delicious stuff, and a real shame that it can't be found in California.<br><br>Finally, the dessert kind of blew my mind. It was a Cheesecake that was accompanied by nothing other than funnel cake! Funnel cake, people! How awesome is that? It was topped with a raspberry sorbet and also dusted with this really interesting (perhaps Indian or Persian) spice.

I really was hesitant to go with 4 stars and not 3. Here's why... after hearing tremendously amazing things about brunch and dinner here we finally were able to fit The Publican in on Saturday 9/20. It was a beautiful day so we decided to sit out on their patio. We were still waiting for one straggler to walk down the street so we ordered drinks and waited a few minutes for him to arrive. Reviewing the menu (PS I was super hungry but not hangry). The nice man came around and offered piping hot (as I was told so-so) coffee. I did not partake. I had a lovely glass of OJ. Finally, our server came back and answered a few questions and took our orders. I got the bratwurst on brioche, jalapeños, onion crisps, cheese, and sour cream. One friend ordered a few sides, super thick cut bacon, hash browns, and a special they had that day was a baguette with whipped butter and jam, my other friend ordered a savory pancake which has breakfast sausage and bacon wrapped chicken thighs baked into it with maple syrup. So far so good. My order and my friend who ordered the sides came out together and the food runner stated that the pancake would be out in just a few moments. Ok fine, he told us not to wait and dig in. So we did, and had a little tasting. The brat, delish. Great snap on the casing, delicious tomatoy almost chili like sauce, nice kick from the pickled jalapenos, coolness from the sour cream. The Bacon delish. Thick fat rendered down. Hash browns, meh, could have left them. The baguette, crisp, hot, chewy, lovely whipped butter and tasty apricot jam. Then we noticed the table that was seated after us all the sudden had a food runner dropping off a plate to one of the 1 guests. We tried to get his attention but he dashed off. And we are still without the pancake nearly 1/2 way through. We stopped eating. Our server, M.I.A. My friend who was waiting on his pancake saw her in the glass inside the restaurant behind us, we tried to wave and get her attention. To no avail. Finally she came back outside and stopped at the table that had our pancake and they were questioning why they only had food for one person. We were finally able to get her attention and I explained that we were still waiting on our food. We would have been done had we not stopped eating. She replies that she would go check on it in a few minutes. I reiterated that we would have been finished with our meal, and he is still without his. This is unacceptable. She needed go check now. She disappears back inside and a minute or 2 later. The pancake appears. Still no server. We start eating again, and the server stops back at the other table to apologize that only one guest received his food due to a mix up and then finally comes to check on us. Literally, within those few moments. My friend who had ordered the baguette resumed eating and was going to butter his bread when a very long and black piece of hair continued to come out of the butter. The sever, by this time, was walking over and asked if everything was going ok as we stared, in disgust, at the knife he was holding mid air with butter and buttered hair hanging from it. She finally took notice and was equally horrified. She asked us if we would like this one replaced and seeing as it had hardly been eaten he said sure. (we all then inspected our food - luckily we were safe.) Up until this point the food was great. So was the new baguette, butter, and jam. For me, I very much enjoyed my brat, the baguette with jam, the bacon was delish, the pancake once it finally arrived was also very, very good. It had a lot going on with the sausage and bacon wrapped chicken thighs then a bit of maple syrup. Food aside. The saving grace of our whole entire visit was the Manager Melissa M. She should get 5 stars for diplomacy and customer service. She came out, very apologetic, of course; nothing was her fault but she shouldered it and allowed us to explain our visit, what happened. Then made us an offer we couldn't refuse. We absolutely did not come here to get anything for free nor did we ask for it. She was so kind and professional, she took care of our bill, got us mimosas, and offered to have us back gratis for dinner. (We didn't have any cash to leave a tip so she ran my friends card for $1 and we left a tip). The way she handled this makes me want to come back to The Publican and give them another shot. I completely understand that accidents happen and no one is perfect and things get mixed up. Melissa M. makes me want to go back. It's so unfortunate that I live in Florida, I would love to frequent The Publican. She also took the time to tell us about the constant changes to the menu, more than the seasonal changes that I was already aware of. She was a delight. Luckily, my friends live down the street from Fulton Market and they will be coming back for dinner.

However, people were rolling in by the bunches despite the bad weather. The place was popping off anyway. Most of the seating is communal, and the booths on the edges are doored pig stalls. We sat communal and didn't mind the seating arrangements. <br><br>The woman and I, feeling a bit hungover,<br>had already established that being healthy was at the bottom of our priority list, and thus started off with the pork rinds and bacon. Both were delicious, though a bit overpriced. <br><br>Pork rinds - $5 - Pork rinds that you would buy at a 711, except poured out of the bag into a metal cup. Good, but worth $5? No, probably not. <br><br>Bacon - $7 - 2 thick pieces of maple syrup-glazed bacon. This was unbelievable. The bacon melts in your mouth and the maple syrup adds a nice touch. The best bacon I've had in my life. Worth the $7? Yes, this is why you come to The Publican. $7 for 2 thick pieces of bacon is expensive, but if you come here, you know you are going to overpay for some delicious food. If you are complaining about the prices, then that is your fault for the lack of research. <br><br>We loved the appetizers, and were eagerly awaiting the 2 main dishes we ordered. She got the:<br><br>Rock Crab Scramble - $19 - This is scrambled eggs mixed with some veggies and crab along with a few pieces of bread. It was pretty delicious, however after finishing she wished she would have ordered something else. Worth the $19? Honestly, no, not really. It's hard to screw up scrambled eggs. The Publican simply marked the price up about 300% because the dish contains crab. Still good though, like I said, we were aware of the prices before attending. <br><br>Then my dish, which was the:<br><br>Slagel Farm Sirloin Steak - $17 - Thinly cut pieces of rare-cooked sirloin steak on top of a large piece of sourdough bread. On top of the steak was a fried egg, some avocado, pico de gallo and cilantro. This plate was heavy and great for padding the tummy after liquor-filled night. Put me right to sleep after. The only gripe I have about the dish is that the steak was too chewy, which is to expect from sirloin. Thus, I place the blame on myself for the choice. It was still very good. Worth the $17? Yes, I would say it is, however next time I'll be getting something else. <br><br>The girl and I departed a fat and happy young Chicago couple, giggling at the piglet who glared at us as we walked to the car.

I had an unexpected chance to try out this restaurant on Saturday and was for the most part, delighted by the ambience and food. Because I wasn't expecting to come here for a while (it isn't even on my list of Chicago restaurants to try), I only knew the name was reputable so I had basically no expectations. I even refrained from studying its Yelp page studiously while sitting at the table waiting for the waiter to come! <br><br>Ambiance: I LOVED it. I loved the wood, I loved the long tables, the bar, the lighting, the booths with the cute little doors, even the bathroom area was so unique and well-designed. Everything was well-lit and allowed for socializing but at no point during the meal was the noise level too high. Perfect. Possibly my favorite restaurant in Chicago, design-wise. 10 outta 5.<br><br>Service: fine. Our dishes came promptly, our waiter was very helpful with the seasonal menu and my water glass was never empty for long. They weren't too hover-y but we definitely felt like they took care of us well!<br><br>Food: we ordered 5 dishes (and a bread plate) for 4 people. The waiter suggested that we order 2 dishes for every person, but we didn't even come close to finishing the last dish. Maybe only 25% of it was consumed. And I think we were all pretty hungry initially. This place is NOT a tapas place. The portions are hefty, so don't go overboard! Now... onto the dishes. <br><br>The bread was freshly baked, but I didn't think it was amazing or anything. But to be fair, bread is usually never the star of a meal. The first dish that came to the table were mussels from Maine cooked with bay, celery and garlic. The broth was delicious - perfectly savory without overwhelming the natural seafood-y taste of the mussels. They also gave us a baguette so we could soak up all the deliciousness of the broth. The mussels were ridiculously fresh and flavorful, and the portion was very generous (we got a full size). <br><br>The second dish that came was the cajun sausage with hushpuppies and this amazingly tart and sweet relish sauce that went well with the subtle heat of meat and the richness of the hushpuppies. I'm from the South and the hushpuppies were definitely up to par with their crispy exteriors and soft, well-seasoned interiors. I really loved this dish. <br><br>The third and last appetizer-y sized dish we got was the artichoke falafel (recommended by our waiter) with honey yogurt. I think out of all 5 dishes, this one was my least favorite because I felt like the falafels were a bit too salty and the sweetness of the yogurt, mixed with the acidity of the picked cucumbers and the savory-ness of the falafel just didn't make much sense on my palate. But all the elements were cooked well! <br><br>Onto the main courses - of course, if you're at the Publican, you gotta order pork! We got the pork chop, which came with an apple relish and the most delicious tangy sauce. This was easily my favorite dish! The pork chop was cooked PERFECTLY and the seasoning was so good - I didn't know pork chops could taste like this. Who knew that there was so much potential there?<br><br>The last dish that came (which we definitely could not finish) was porchetta covered with a brothy, rich sauce with arugula, egg yolk, parmesan slivers and bacon bits on top. It was SUCH a decadent dish and contrasted sharply with the other pork dish we tried because the flavors were so rich and buttery and creamy. I wish I had more stomach room to devour this dish, but it was simply too heavy.

From the menu, we ordered oysters as a 'Chef's Selection' - there was minced garlic, and the each of the oysters from a different region had a different taste.  The Bouchot Mussels were okay - the mussels were extremely small, but, the broth was nice and salty, and was good with the complimentary crusty bread.  The whole Farm Chicken was a simple roasted chicken, but I think it had too many herbs as it was very floral.  The crinkle-cut french fries that came with were all soggy from the chicken juice.  The raelotte, which was a sweeter version of potatoes, had little pickles and cheese, which were good as it was a play on sweet vs. savory. The tasting of all the Three Hams was interesting as I was intrigued by the 'goat butter' (had a shortbread kind of a consistency).  We also had some scallops, which were also underwhelming, as they were also flavorless.

I def like this a lot better than the first.<br><br>Alpha King Pale Ale $5<br>~ Three Floyds BrewingCo., Indiana, 6.00%<br>~ The pale ale have a rather deep amber color w/ a very creamy head to it and it has a citrus aroma and hoppy finish.<br>~ This is definitely my kind of beer and my fave out of the 3 we ordered.<br><br>  Beets $11<br>~ burrata, arugula, walnut, saba<br>~ I just love the creaminess of burrata and nothing better than having it together with one of my favorite veggies, beet. <br><br>Charcuterie Plate $15 (half)<br>~ Every time I see Charcuterie on the menu, I will ask if it's made in house and theirs was made at their Butcher Shop Publican Quality Meat just across the street.<br>~ I am sold right away and I was definitely not disappointed since we loved every elements here... from the meat and pate to the pickles and mustard. Sort of like the crisp younger pickles, less overwhelming and wouldn't take over the flavor of the other food.<br><br>Pork Belly $24<br>~ grits, radish & asparagus<br>~ Just look at this huge block of melt in your mouth fatty goodness that's packed with flavors.<br>~ The grits was creamy and light which balance out the pork belly, also love how they shaved the asparagus on top which looks really pretty. <br><br>Honeycomb Tripe $8<br>~ This was so soft and packed with flavors, dip your bread in the sauce and clean the plate good.<br>~ I couldn't find this on their online menu so maybe this was a special<br><br>Blood Sausage $18<br>~ It hit the spot once again, perfect texture and casing with the perfect roasted cauliflowers. Just like the charcuterie plate, the sausage was mad by their butcher shop. <br>~ Love the sprinkles of pistachio which is a must to give some sort of contrast in texture to the soft blood sausage.<br><br>Squash Cake $18<br>~ bosc pears, maple-sherry syrup, pear butter, pepitas & ricotta ice cream<br>~  Love the how the squash cake was served warm and that was probably the smoothest ricotta ice cream I ever had... the pear butter was different.

The pork shoulder comes with two fried eggs and crispy baked potato, creamy mustard sauce on top. The sauce was a good company for the pork, the meat was very tender. Also the cucumber pickles in the potato can help ease the fatty taste. The bacon was so good! You have to try it~so tender, I just love it has lean meat and little bit fat on it too.

The swinging doors to the individual booths was an interesting concept and experience. We had the red wine poached eggs, pork belly, Belgian waffles, and sides of Publican bacon and hash browns. The waffle was overcooked initially and hard to cut. The waitress came by to ask about our food and had the chef make a new one right away when we pointed out how hard the waffle was. :) Great service! The staff was also very attentive that kept a sharp eye on our water for refills and made sure our plates were cleared promptly. <br><br>As for the food, we couldn't complain. Everything but the Belgian waffles were very unique and rich in flavor. The Belgian waffle did not stand out to me and I would probably not order it again. But the other savory dishes were exquisite! We had the Public bacon before and were excited to have it again - does not disappoint, the right balance of sweet and savory. This was my first time having the pork belly and it was very tender. They were out of beans so they replaced the beans with gritz. The gritz, which was slightly sweet, was still a nice touch to the pork belly along with the egg. The Publican does a great job of including eggs in its dishes in a complementary fashion. Let's not forget about the has browns. I love my potatoes and this must be the best hash browns I've ever had. It has the right amount of crispiness on the outside layer and softness on the inside. There also seems to be a hint of cheese so if you love cheese fries, you must give this a try. <br><br>I like how the menu is not overwhelming with too many choices but even so, there is limited stomach real estate.

They were thick and tender. I also had the Sweet potatoes with fried Sage. These by far were the best sweet potatoes I have ever had. They were cubed and pan seared with hazelnut picada.

We didn't care for the turnips. They weren't well-seasoned and seemed undercooked. They came to our table alone (the food comes out as it's ready), so we were stuck with those by themselves for a while. We didn't finish it. Then came the suckling pig, which was fabulous. Probably some of the tastiest, juiciest pork I've had. I only wish there had been more of it. <br><br>For dessert we had the caramel pound cake that came with a marigold ice cream (I couldn't identify that flavor) and blackberries. It was really tasty but not very caramel-y.<br><br>Hubs said he had two beers he liked that he'd never heard of, so that was a win in his book.<br><br>All in all, our tab was about $110, which was a decent price for the meal.

Publican is farm-to-table with a beer hall layout that encourages strangers to talk and gather in a communal meal. For brunch we get the red wine poached egg with La Quercia prosciutto, sourdough and Bearnaise, the soft shell crab sandwich with roasted tomato remoulade, bacon, and apple salad. Gaspar orders a sixer of Kusshi oysters, neat and clean from British Columbia, and I order a twelver of Rappahannock oysters, which have a milder taste than the Kusshi oysters but not as crispy as the Peter's Point oysters from Blue Hill, Maine. <br><br>No visit to Publican is complete without pork, so the two of us split an order of pork shoulder that sits on a bed of wild rice, layered with kimchi (good bacteria), cucumber, and sunny side eggs. The bloody Mary's are infused with a house mix that is flavorful and rich without overpowering the palate. After we order and our drinks arrive Gaspar tells me about his trip. (\"Well, Lohr, travelers looking for that perfect vacation this summer may do well to look south. Mexican border towns have seen a resurgence. Tijuana has rebuilt itself for the locals, starting with the revamped cantinas on the infamous Avenida Revolución. Head from Dandy del Sur--a perfect, dimly lit dive bar--to tasting house La Mezcalera, whose 18-flavor mezcal sampler includes chicken and hazelnut, to Mous Tache, a tiny punk-rock venue with themed shots such as the Hercules Poirot and Burt Reynolds.\") <br><br>Fulton Market is one of the many revitalized neighborhoods in Chicago, where developers took the industrial aesthetic of the warehouses and plants and infused an urban chic to it, lots of available lofts with brick and timber features, clean angles and exposed pipes and gothic light posts. From a fake account I tweet Kim Kardashian a still from her sex tape. This week's \"Wine About It\" is about the most annoying people to text with. \"But you don't have to be drunk to enjoy Tijuana. It's a city where retro kitsch co-exists with youth culture. Spend a Saturday afternoon at the greyhound track or a cosplay convention, where teenagers lip-sync to J-pop. Of course, you'll want to see if you can track down a lucha libre bout. And it's worth checking out a Toros de Tijuana baseball game or the local basketball team, the Zonkeys.\" On the way to Publican today, due to squad cars blocking the street I had to divvy onto Harrison through the medical district, when I passed what I thought was a gang war. Women and children were screaming and flailing their arms and boys in the street in matching gang colors brawled with machetes and sledge hammers. I dropped to the ground and the divvy skidded a few feet further, but when I paid closer attention, it turned out that the banner two of the gangbangers held read something called \"Bud Billiken Parade 2016.\" Gaspar drones on. \"On Sunday mornings, take a cab up the hill to the sprawling Colonia Francisco Villa flea market. Dine on the market's phenomenal street food, where a buck or 2 will buy you a bite of outstanding chorizo gorditas, fried fish tacos or tart lime-and-chile shaved ice.\" <br><br>The heating in this place is bonkers. It's like a vent is directly above me and blasting hot air onto my skull, drying out my tongue and my eyes, I think I might choke, except Gaspar keeps talking to me like nothing's wrong, and I realize it's because I keep nodding my head, and I even hear myself somehow saying, \"Uh-huh, yeah, for sure, Mr. Robot man...\" I shove a piece of pork shoulder into my mouth to stop talking, which is surprisingly still warm and juicy. \"For the daring, a few times each summer the Bullring by the Sea hosts a proper bullfight. The spectacle is tough to watch, but the corrida's complicated emotions stick to your soul. Go once to understand why Ernest Hemingway called bullfighting both a tragedy and one of the only real sports.\" Over the clanging of dishes I hear myself say my life is a living hell. But if we're being honest, what's really distracting me are the waking visions of this past Spring Awakening and the roaming droves of blonde tweens in frayed denim shorts. The naivete involved for a young girl to wear almost nothing and think nothing would ever happen to her, that people would look but not touch. \"A cheap lunch will balance a decadent dinner at Misión 19, where the six-course sampler includes bites of scallop parfait with avocado and chicharrón, and the umami punch of mushroom risotto with huitlacoche and epazote. Try Caesar's, a 90-year-old institution where the Caesar salad was invented. While the clubby, checkered-floor interior bar is tempting, grab a patio seat and bask in Tijuana's bustling new energy.\" The idea of a sampler platter makes me burst out in laughter.

With that being said, I have taken an interest in trying restaurants on the coveted Michelin list. Publican did not meet up to the standards of the other restaurants I have tried (Longman & Eagle, Girl & Goat, Gilt Bar) <br><br>The Bad: I ordered the yellowtail, it was bland and completely raw in the middle. I understand that meatier fish can be raw, but this just was not done right. Devoid of any flavor aside from raw fish in the middle - it just did not do it for me. The bib lettuce was nasty- it literally tasted like they had just crumbled up pork rinds and scattered them all over the salad.  It was difficult for me to eat, as I am not a pork-rind, pork-ear, any fried skin type of person. The skirt steak was so bad that no one even ate it, which to me is interesting as a place that boasts excellent meats, you would think the quality of the meat would be so good and flavorful, that you wouldn't need any sauce. The BBQ carrots were not bad but to me were not a stand-out dish. <br><br>The Good: The chicken was phenomenal. It is very nice to go to a restaurant and get an amazing roasted chicken done right. This and the potatoes which were in an aioli, were the stand outs for the meal. The porchetta was also pretty delicious along with the dumplings that were underneath. <br><br>The bar menu was extensive, tons of beers and a good wine selection. <br><br>I most likely will not be back to Publican. I was expecting really robust flavors and did not really get that from anything that we ordered. Nothing WOW'd me to the point where I have to come back again. It is also extremely pricey.

Cost will be around $10-$25 depending on the dish.  <br><br>Also, if you're a good drinker, you'll appreciate the drink menu as well.  I'm not a big bloody mary fan but with a kick of chipotle and a mix of huge veggies inside like a pickle and green beans, it's something that everyone at the table raved about.  Mix that with beer (I had a Left Milk Stout which was smooth/delicious), mimosas and more for a good long list.  <br><br>The decor is fun and memorable with a Western European atmosphere mixed with a farmhouse in which there are communal tables, tables that look like stalls and other tables with interesting stands.  Long rows of hanging round lights litter the ceiling, reminiscent of the LACMA lights standing upside down and the servers all wear unique shirts that are like jerseys with the Publican name on the front and their last names on the back.  Even better, they're all friendly, funny and helpful.  <br><br>The Publican is a great restaurant all-around and a terrific experience.  Cheers Publican!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The food was very very good.

Preparation was spot on and we got a good variety of quality from all over Canada and New England. A ricotta bread with apples, mint and honey was dense with flavor, yet still springy in texture so as not to completely weigh down our bellies before we got to the rest of our food. The steak with fried egg, ramps, fingerling potatoes and romesco sauce was amazing. As was the chorizo flatbread with cumin raita, onion, cucumber. All of these dishes were well-proportioned and the relatively unusual ingredients for your typical brunch were impressively harmonious in each plate.<br><br>The Publican maple-syrup-braised bacon deserves its own separate ode - savory, salty, fatty and crispy pork belly is always good, but the quality of the meat (and maybe the braising in maple syrup) made it something extra special. Hash browns were pretty standard. I liked that they had some exclusive options from  Rare Tea Cellars and I tried the Pue-rh, which was awesome. Still though, the bill kind of killed our wallets, which is probably why I haven't made it over here until now, and won't likely be in for a while. <br><br>We loved the patio seating.

The Tennessee ham, they said, was salty but good. The Virginia ham was the first that induces a smile on their faces.

Needless to say, they were quite happy.<br><br>For their main entrée, they ordered a whole chicken. Not being a rabid pescatarian, I sampled a piece and was quite satisfied. The chicken had been rubbed or marinaded in oregano. You'd think that oregano was only for spaghetti sauce. Apparently not as far as Publican goes. Succulent, juicy, tender: three words that came to mind while tasting the chicken. I had a grilled Atlantic char that reminded me of salmon. Cooked thoroughly without me having to request it to be cooked so, I was incredibly happy with my order. Served with radishes and sea salt the way they're served in France, I was even more pleased.

It's not like we would have waited just for him to arrive to order. My brother drinks like a fish and eats like a cow or whatever you would compare that too, so we would have ordered plenty. Arrived at 5 PM when they open, and there was no wait, and by the time my friend arrived at 6 PM, there was a 2 hour wait for a 4-top. I definitely was not in the mood for dessert or a drink after that.

With that said, its obvious why The Publican received the James Beard Award for decor. Simply amazing.<br><br>But what truly separates a Kahan restaurant from any other is the food itself. The concept of an all-pig restaurant might frighten some, but it sings beautiful music to others (including myself).

Sweet. Salty. Fragile. A sunny-side up egg lies on top of the pork shoulder, adding an interesting texture.

We sat a long communal type dinner table which personally I'm not a fan of but whatever just bring me some food and i'll keep my mouth shut. We were in such a large group and ordered so much food I can't remember when everything came out but i'll just rattle off a list of what I remember.<br><br>We ordered the taste of three hams and non of them disappointed, all of them were very good but my favorite had to be the La Quercia Rossa. Who would have thought the ham from Iowa would outshine a ham from Spain?! The grilled Octopus was surprisingly very good, I loved it. Grilled yellowtail was excellent, the Bouchon Mussels were huge and very tasty. The blood sausage, farm chicken and the Duck Breast were so mouthwatering I was thinking of ordering seconds for myself. To round out the meal we had a bunch of different desserts but the one that stood out for me was the Chocolate Puff Pastry. Publican also has an excellent wine and craft beer menu! This place is every bit as good as Anthony Bourdain said it would be. Staff was extremely helpful, the speed at which they brought out the dishes and cleaned up each plate was very fast.

 5 IS SO RESTRICTING.<br><br>I made reservations about a week before I came in as I learned that day my dad was coming to town.  I've been told to come here plenty of times by friends and coworkers, and having tried PQM and Peasantry beforehand, I had nothing but the highest hopes for the flagship.  Making a reservation seemed like a good idea because of the restaurants high profile, even if it was later on a Wednesday.  The restaurant called twice to confirm my OpenTable rez, so they're either quite thorough or I have zero credibility.  Both are completely within the realm of possibility..<br><br>My dad and I arrived about 20 minutes before our reservation and opted for the $8 valet since parking in the West Loop is apparently roughly as easy as finding a red line with no discernible urine odor.  The place looked to be about 75% full, which didn't really throw me off.  This has to be a great restaurant, right?  To our surprise, we were seated immediately...<br><br>At the huge communal table, which was tighter than most airlines' economy class.  Our menus and beer/wine list more than covered our dining space and were printed on the size of paper I imagine historical documents, say the Magna Carta, are.  Very impressive was the beer list, but it took our waitress a solid 15 minutes to arrive and take our drink order.  My dad was already a scotch or two deep, but alas, I wasn't.<br><br>To the right of my airline seat sat two DePaul sorority girls.  They were yelling, as was everyone else in the restaurant, because the designer thought it best to build the place in a style architecturally akin to a dining hall: high ceilings, hard surfaces everywhere, and nothing on the walls to dampen any of it.  The lighting also reminded me of a dining hall I frequented during my freshman year.<br><br>After another 10 minutes of so of waiting for our beers, we thought it best to get our order out immediately.  I got the small charcuterie plate for us to split, lamb, and an order of squash.  My dad, the mussel stew.  I advised on something sausage-esque or at least pork, but he was set on seafood.  <br><br>The charcuterie plate was a thing of beauty, with much more than your garden variety of meat treats; it was complete with blood sausage, pate, pork pie, and a few other fantastic selections, just enough for 2 to split.  Accompanying the plate was a basket of thick, crusty bread and a disk of wonderfully creamy butter.  With these two items along with our beers and waters, our dining area was at capacity.  How was this whole entree situation going to work?<br><br>Logistically poorly, that's how.  They set down a cast iron dish on which to rest the stew and a small casserole dish with a ladle to give us an idea of how cramped this was about to get.  Around this time, we ordered more beer as our headaches from the noise grew, and they were delivered as our empty beer glasses and bottles sat there.  I barely ever care about poor table service (seriously, look at my other reviews), but our limited amount of real estate made every square inch count.  As this all took place, we were enclosed on our other side by other, less annoying diners.<br><br>Although we were told dishes come out as they're ready (restaurant code for \"screw coordinating this stuff\"), the squash came out about 15 minutes before the other two entrees, and was either gone or cold by the time the others arrived.  It was fantastic, tender squash, with a hint of sweetness and overall a great seasonal fall side.  The lamb and stew came roughly at the same time and both were excellent.  The stew was chock full of surprisingly fresh mussels, the occasional medium-sized shrimp, and a bit of linguine, all in a complex, dark mushroom broth.  It certainly wasn't too salty, as many seafood stews tend to be.  The two cuts of lamb had excellent flavor and came on a bed of flavorful, aromatic greens, but most of the cuts were fat or bone and left much to be desired.  <br><br>We opted out of dessert, and while the food was excellent overall, I can't help taking issue with the experience of it all.  Having to basically yell at my dad who sat in front of me while being elbowed by (and elbowing) coughing strangers made for a wholeheartedly disappointing experience.  I'd literally have rather sat at a fast food restaurant.  Maybe it's just me, but doesn't making a reservation a week in advance warrant a table?", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I took my cousin here for dinner and had an excellent meal.<br><br>First we got ourselves a beer.

The hostess escorted us to the waiting standing \"bar\" area, and we ordered some juice and coffee. As more and more people showed  up (a lot of people also had reservations), the ones who didn't have reservations were hanging out with us. At some point, we noticed everyone who arrived after us, somehow got seated first. WTH? They seemed very stingy with their seating, and what I also noticed was that they weren't very efficient in cleaning up and clearing tables out after people left. <br><br>Onto the food. After we complained twice about waiting so long, we finally got seated, and they offered us complimentary a maple syrup pecan pastry (delicious!) and an apple cake (ok). I have to say, their coffee was really delicious as well, very smooth. But for our main course, I went with the pork belly bibimbap, one of my friends went with the waffle. Waffle was just okay according to my friend, and for me, the kimchi was just waaaay too overpowering in the bibimbap. We also ordered the maple glazed bacon which came out a few minutes after our main courses. It was good. When we wanted to pay our bill, it took a while for our waiter to come back to us.

They brought this out first but it actually pairs well with the heavier dishes.  In the future I'll ask if this can be brought out with a meat dish.<br><br>Spicy Pork Rinds: I love pork rinds and to be honest I prefer the ones in the bag you buy from the store.  Our thoughts were that these were not salty enough - I could have used no chili/lime powder (not very spicy at all) and just a lot of salt.  It was neat to try them fresh - they were so fluffy and a little greasy.  I would not order these again though.<br><br>Fried Cauliflower: My partner commented that this was his favorite dish of all.  It was very similar to broccoli tempura, but of course with cauliflower, with a great tangy/spicy dipping sauce.  It was a bit heavy for me to start with before the meat but I thought it was good.<br><br>Pork Belly: This is what we came here for.  It wasn't as tender as we expected - it was more of a pulled pork texture but it was tasty.  It had a sweet flavor to it which I needed to balance a little more with the brussel sprout salad.<br><br>Country Ribs: These had a really great flavor - it was like the best pork chop I ever had.  It looked like a steak, had a great char grilled flavor, and was very juicy!  The meat was more on the medium-rare side so be sure to ask for it well-done if you don't like your pork less coooked.  I liked this better than the pork belly and it sure was a lot of food.<br><br>Overall, this was a nice experience for our Anniversary.  Given all of the great restaurants left to try in Chicago and how little we go to eat somewhere of this caliber ($ - with one drink each it was about $70/person w/ tip),  I don't think we'll be back soon but I would say this place is definitely worth trying.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Whoa Communal Seating! Ok, so this is partly my fault and I will accept SOME responsibility. My best friend had just arrived in town from VA and we had loads to catch up on. We had a 7PM reservation on a Thursday. <br><br>We arrived and the restaurant had a decent crowd, but not overly crowded. We were ushered to the back corner of the restaurant near the the kitchen and an exit door for staff. We were seated at the corner of the table next to some ladies who had sprawled out as if they were in their own private booth. We took our seat and began to peruse the menu.<br> <br>Our waitress, Mary was friendly and explained that she would let us know if we were ordering too much or not enough food. We selected a bottle of wine and she left us to make our decisions. We selected mussels, octopus, half order of serrano and sweet potatoes. Mary staggered each of the dishes so they didn't all hit our tiny corner of the table all at once. <br><br>The mussels were good, but didn't blow either of us away. The serrano was delectable, as to be expected. We both enjoyed the octopus. The sweet potatoes were huge and sweet enough to serve as dessert. We were content. <br><br>Ok, so why the three stars? The back door was used throughout our meal and just an FYI it's cold outside. Every time the door was opened a cold draft hit our end of the table and trust me that doesn't make for an enjoyable dining experience. I would understand if there were no other open seats in the restaurant, some sucker has to sit there, but come on. Even as we left the restaurant there were open seats throughout. <br><br>The other deduction of a star may not be within the restaurants control, but as I said, if there are other open seats available why stack us all on top of each other - especially those who thought enough to make a reservation in advance. The group of ladies (that I had mentioned earlier in the review) that had sprawled out were either, not familiar with communal seating or they simply had no regard for personal space. I didn't think that any of our conversations were that fascinating, but apparently they were a lot more interesting than what the group of four had to say. Seriously, 80% of our meal was spent with two of the group of four ladies continuously looking over as if we asked them to join us.

I gave a lower score than most of the fellow Yelpers has and risk getting stoned to death. Believe me, I really tried to love it, maybe its the countless numbers of 4 or 5 stars, or the endless number of friends who say its awesome, or just the overall hype, the place didn't seem to be 4 or 5 star worthy. The place is definitely \"A-OK\" and I wouldn't consider myself a \"fan\" of this place. I would be \"A-OK\" to not come here again and blow this amount of money.<br><br>This place is located at Chicago's Meatpacking district and for good reason. The meats are freshest and the quality is fantastic. The place was rather dim and this place wasn't considered a romantic place, just a place to indulge your red-meat fetish.  The seating was interesting -- there were large communal tables, which were cool, the booths had \"doors\" to it and the wait staff looked like they were wearing car mechanic uniforms. That Saturday was a pretty darn hot and humid day with highs in the high-90s in Chi-City. When we got there, the AC barely felt it was on. The waitress said it was due to how many people were there earlier and that the AC probably couldn't \"keep up\". <br><br>By the time we got there, it was around 9PM.  We were seated in one of their booths, which had little doors to fence us in.... like cattle. The prices were rather steep and averaged about $15 a plate and is meant to be served family style. the plates were enough for four people to \"sample\" off of, so if you think you'll be getting \"seconds\" on a particular dish, you may want to order two plates of it. We ordered 6-entrees and a desert and we left there full, and less in our pocket: the total cost came out to be around $250.<br><br>If you have to order something, that my friend, are the fried clams. They were AWESOME and the raw oysters we ordered were absolutely terrific. <br><br>BATHROOM REVIEW: The bathrooms are located near the entrance. There were 3 women and 2 mens private bathrooms. Upon entering the bathroom, you can lock the door behind you. I think this bathroom was bigger than my closets. It had a toilet AND a urinal. The red wallpaper reminded me of a hotel and the piping and knobs had gold accents. This was a setup where the communal unisex sinks where located OUTSIDE of the stall to wash your hands. So you need to unlock the door with your dirty, fecal, urine residue hands along with the 50-people who have used the bathroom before you at some point in time during the night,  to get out..... then you go wash your hands with soap and water. They had 2 Dyson airblade hand dryers and some lotion which was nice. The interesting thing was that there were no mirrors, at least for the Men's bathroom. Sometimes you just wanna check to see if you have food stuck in your teeth. Sit or squat?? You can definitely SIT, but please, wash your hands.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "While the ambiance and setting might deserve a 5-star, the food simply didn't live up to the hype.

So the Publican won our yelp contest for tonight's pre-flight dinner. All day long I'm looking forward to dinner almost as much as vacation thinking about those mouthwatering photos and the exciting dinner options to choose from. Publican opened at 330p and we arrived at about 445 the place was fairly open with only maybe one or two tables. We were told that we can have snacks and light appetizers but the dinner menu was not available until 530p nor could we get the dinner menu to look at until 5:30 PM which was okay we can make it work and have a cocktail. Initial assessment is nice rustic/modern interior with kind of unique long table oriented set up for seating and that's kind of the communal approach which is hip these days. Interior was nice and our server was friendly and attentive and on his game throughout the evening and if your server should be occupied elsewhere they seem to have several assistants and helpers there to pick up dirty plates refill water and check in on you. I would assess the service as strong and the atmosphere as acceptable to good. Sadly I have to report that the food pretty much across-the-board was a COMPLETE LET DOWN and did not at all measure up to the great photos and our enthusiasm for dining here. I'll itemize what we had and give you brief comment:<br>Assorted oysters on half--probably the highlight of the evening fresh, tasty if they weren't four dollars each I would've had a dozen more. Cheese & charcuterie--okay and another one of the stronger courses for the evening but honestly I've had better elsewhere and can't recall a truly stand out item from what was presented. Avocado citrus salad--light, non-offensive but nothing to wow about. Sardine entree we shared with 5 inch sardine on toast with some light mustardy sauce and pickled radish on top--nearly inedible! I'm adventurous and after one bite, then another to check myself sent it back as not acceptable: too fishy, too funky n not in the good way. Cauliflower salad--acceptable cauliflower with very light vinegar-dressing ok but not a wow. Suckling pig with rice-- pig tasted over cooked and even chewy and the rice and sauce almost had an Asian or thai spiciness to it. It was okay but again not a standout item and I was hoping for much more. Lastly, the porchetta our server had raved about - okay but really kind of a large slice of pork he compared to our beloved pork belly looked and tasted like it had been cooked in the crockpot with some light watery broth and then put on a plate with chunks of Romain lettuce dropped on top of it. We didn't even finish this item it was just weak. <br><br>In summary acceptable atmosphere attentive and well-intentioned service but the food tonight was a complete swing and a miss.

Instead we opted to get our own meals, although the carnivore and I did share some delish oysters to start. Oh, and we could all enjoy a bottle of pinot gris as well. <br><br>As for my main entree I ordered the mussels. It was a huge portion that came with a very large chunk of french bread..and I made a pretty good dent in it.

The service we received from the waiter was excellent, he was awesome. I ordered a coffee and quickly made my selection completely based off of what the waiter suggested for a 'light' breakfast, and the food came with the other orders incredibly quickly. <br><br>Rock Crab Scramble - due to the speed that this came out, I was naturally a bit skeptical. But all my fears melted away as soon as I took my first bite of the scramble. It was awesome. The crab meat was sweet and flavorful, and the egg complimented the sweetness without overpowering the natural seafood taste of the crab. The bread that accompanied it was a bit hard (and some of the pieces were toasted a bit too long) but were still a good compliment for the light scramble. Although simple, it was exactly what I wanted at the moment. <br>I tried a few other things that were passed around at the table, but I don't think I had enough to really want to make a solid assessment about. <br><br>Overall, this meal was very enjoyable. It was one of the slightly pricier brunch places I've had ($18 for the scramble which was a lighter portion). But the quality was very good, and I feel like it was worth it.

I decided to opt for brunch on a rare Sunday off. Made a reservation easily online for 9:30. The location is easily accessible through the green line, I'd suggest not driving because parking can be dodgy and being that the area house quite a few warehouses, there are all kinds of restricting with loading and the like. They have a patio area but I chose to sit inside. The inside is beautiful and airy, whimsical yet balanced, and despite communal seating (not my favorite at a solitary brunch with a good book) quite comfortable. <br>Service was efficient and friendly. My severs name was Benny and he was full of informative guidance and quirky humor. I asked for suggestions and after some indecision ( mainly because I was hungry so everything looked appetizing), I settled on the tabbouleh with sausage and their famed bacon. The entree delighted me with the array of textures and flavors. I knew their sausages from frequenting publican quality meats, so no surprise that it was phenomenal, full of spices and subtle nuances, but I was taken aback with the care and attention given to the accompaniments. Perfectly over easy eggs, salty and moist feta cheese, Job's tears (apparently a barley like grain) served as the base. They bacon was stupid good, but that was to be expected.<br>The only negative mark belongs to the doughnut I ordered, it was a lemon old fashioned doughnut. Now I know my way around an old fashioned doughnut. It should have a thick outer exterior with a heavy dose of slightly hardened glaze but a soft, light inside. This tasted like pound cake, slightly dry pound cake, with no finesse or attention to texture or flavor...confusing really. If you can't do it justice, don't do it at all or at least call a spade a spade (or lemon pound cake, as it most certainly resembles).<br>Coffee was perfectly strong and always full...great with lemon pound cake, er doughnut.

The taste of the toast mixed perfectly with the richness of the lobster and texture of the eggs.

You could taste the apple cider throughout the donut. I didn't get coffee, but if I did I would have had to ordered another one of these suckers.<br><br>3) Pretzel - Wow. Man, I loved this sucker.

 We're confused, but not upset, and let it slide.  <br><br>Then a big group sits to our right, leaving two chairs empty between us and them.  And a couple sits directly next to us, leaving the entire empty half table on their other side.  And we eat for maybe an hour, and eventually one of the chairs on our right gets filled.  So... that was weird.  <br><br>The seats are too close to each other, and this wouldn't be an issue if there weren't SO MANY EMPTY SEATS on either side of us.  Instead the six of us are all trying not to bump elbows and plates and the aggressively efficient water-fillers (take a sip, count to ten, I bet that water glass is full again) while there's SO MUCH SPACE next to us.  Part of the joy of communal seating is that bustling feeling, but oh my goodness there's no need if there's no need.<br><br>Puzzle B: separate tabs.  During said wait we stood at the cocktail/bar area and had some beer and the taste of three hams (so good).  The hostess approached us and told us to settle our tab, then she'd show us our table.  We did so, but with much confusion.  This is literally the same room, right?  We're moving seven feet away.  Other places transfer tabs... right?  Am I crazy?  What's going on here?  Why are there giant paintings of pigs on the walls?  Actually those are awesome.<br><br>Puzzle C: mysterious illness.  After eating some of the veal tartare, boy's stomach took a nose dive.  I ended up putting him in a cab and meeting him at home, where he proceeded to lie down for a few hours and drink some ginger tea.  I was fine though.<br><br>Puzzle D: area.  That's fine though, and part of the charm.  No need to walk alone around here at night.<br><br>Great things: smoked char with poached egg, frisee, beets.  Absolutely spectacular dish; like watching fireworks (super loud, smoky, awesome ones).  You can't really tell if you like it, but you're definitely enjoying it.    <br><br>Taste of three hams with goat butter and peasant bread: razor thin slices of three kinds of ham, lots of fatty savoriness, some sweetness, the butter was like cheese.  So good.  <br><br>Beer list: unusual, fascinating, and full of fun.  Loved our beers and our server at the cocktail area.<br><br>Good things: sunchokes and turnips: blackened and sweet, which is great, with pistachios and figs, awesome, and some orange slices.  Flip back to the puzzles.  This was confusing.  But good!<br>Squash and marinated kale: spicy, roasty, fall-y, delicious.  A very solid dish.<br><br>Service: extremely prompt, perhaps too much so (the water thing was a little too fast).  Loved getting the new small plates with each course.  Very friendly<br><br>So overall, food was quite good, but our experience was a bit lacking given the price point.  Boy wants to go back for a nice meal sometime, and I'm game to try again, especially since I wasn't the one to get sick from it.  Maybe next time the seating won't be quite so confusing.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This had been on my list of places to try, and I was a bit disappointed with my meal.

It doesn't matter, just get this dish. Imagine confit pork and duck leg cooked together into a heavenly meat spread, and mixed with apricots. Put this on crusty country bread. We all agreed this was the best dish of the night.<br><br>Frites: I don't really like fries-- people usually give me a hard time for this, but the real problem is that most fries don't taste like the ones at Publican. These were flavorful, crispy, piping hot, and just amazing dipped in the accompanying mayo sauce. We were sad when our server took away our cone of frites-- I think we still had like 2 left...<br><br>Hallibut with wild mushrooms and caviar: Have you ever had caviar that tastes like maple syrup? I love food that makes your tastebuds go \"wait, what?\" in a good way. We learned from our very knowledgeable foodie server that the way the caviar is brined determines a lot of its flavor profile-- salty, sweet, etc. The sweet caviar made this fish dish really interesting. Everything worked together-- maybe not perfectly, but it was certainly memorable.<br><br>Greens with grits: I'm not a huge fan of grits normally-- even when I had it in the south, the grits were a bit too dry for me. However, I really liked the greens with grits here. Lots of flavor, but wasn't too salty, and the grits picked up a lot of the juice coming out of the veggies. I think this was notable for me mainly because I finally enjoyed grits in a dish.<br><br>Taste of 3 hams and goat butter: My friends all know I'm nuts about butter, so it's no surprise I loved the goat cheese butter here, which was like really, really light, really soft goat cheese. I enjoyed the hams despite having just returned from Italy and having enough cured meat to last me a lifetime. The quality of the ham was top notch, especially the serrano.<br><br>We also had the:<br><br>-  Pork rinds: Really delicious and satisfying spicy flavor, kind of like nacho cheese doritos but much better. Some people may not like nacho cheese doritos, but I for one, do.<br><br>- Suckling pig: From what I remember, 3 cuts combined. There were pulled-pork like bits, pork belly, and a combination of the two.  Loved the crispiness of pork belly parts, and the bits of fat in the meat were quite delicious. However, this dish wasn't a standout for us because we thought it was still slightly on the dry side.<br><br>- Polish sausage: My friends loved this dish, but I thought it was a bit dry. Has some spice to it. I really enjoyed the root vegetables + olives that came with it on the side-- really nice combo.<br><br>Between 6 of us, we ordered 8 dishes, which was really more than enough. We also ordered the mussels, but our server forgot to put them in. We didn't mind in the end, because we were so stuffed! <br><br>Publican deserves a 5 in my opinion because 1) the food has a touch of something special, and attention is paid to small details; 2) we learned something cool from our server, who was a delight; and 3) the prices are reasonable.

While we tried to put together a new game plan she came back twice in a very short amount of time. It was clear to us her shift was ending soon and she wanted us to be on desserts before we even had salads. Which, by the way, ended up being completely overdressed.

The fish and chips were perfect, flaky and moist. The sand dabs were excellent as well, almost buttery in the way that they melt in your mouth. <br><br>Everything I've ever had from the Slagel Family Farm is delectable and the Sirloin Steak at the Publican is no exception. You'll want to savor each bite of this flavorful cut of meat and the avocado/beet side dish compliments its flavors perfectly. <br><br>The farm chicken with summer sausage and frites will not disappoint as it is ridiculously tender and moist in the way that good chicken should be. The crispy frites soak up the flavorful chicken juices! You'll probably make inappropriate noises and you definitely won't want to stop eating them. <br><br>I have two final words of wisdom for you: PORK BELLY. The maple glaze gives it a perfect sweet crispness on the outside and the inside is pure juicy, mouthwatering pork goodness. Trust me, it's everything you want it to be. <br><br>By the end of the meal I was in the happiest meat coma I've experienced in a while and I'm already planning a trip back.

We opted for the al fresco dining as though it was unusually hot and humid for May in Chicago, the outdoor area is protected from the sun. Our server Antonio took good care of us and all four us enjoyed the meal. I did peek inside and it was really modern and chic looking; the bathroom is funky and definitely worth checking out and I loved the ceilings and wallpaper. <br><br>I had heard from several people that they consider Publican to offer the best brunch in Chicago; though after dining here North Pond still is number one in my book, I definitely can see how others would view Publican as tops. The menu is creative with lots of interesting and upscale options featuring seasonal cuisine. What is fun is that the Saturday and Sunday brunch menus are completely different from one another, so you can either take a peek online and choose the day that has the menu most appealing to your palate or you have a built in excuse to come here twice.<br><br>Everyone at our table liked their dish of choice; my father ordered the pork schnitzel served with a waffle (and proclaimed it was the best schnitzel he had ever had), my mother and wife both selected the soft-scrambled egg focaccia and I went with the chorizo flatbread topped with a fried egg, cucumbers, mint, fresno chiles and cumin raita. You know a menu is exotic when the Yelp spellchecker is trying to inform me that five of the foods I just mentioned are misspelled (though surprisingly it did approve schnitzel). The table shared the Burton's maple syrup braised Publican bacon which consisted of two very large, thick pieces of juicy and tasty pork belly. Publican's brunch is definitely gourmet and everything is elevated from your typical bacon and eggs type fare. Portions are fairly generous and the price point is quite reasonable (most dishes run $10 to $15). <br><br>Brunch at the Publican also has nice beverage options; if you are in need of some java they offer a bottomless cup or a French press (Intelligentsia has created a blend exclusively for Publican). There are fresh squeezed juices, rare teas and of course adult beverages. I had the Bloody Mary which came with a choice of a sidecar of one of three craft beers. The Bloody Mary mix is house-made as are the added celery bitters. The Bloody was nice and spicy and had an attractive appearance with lots of asparagus spears and cucumbers protruding, but I found that the pickling of these veggies did not have the most pleasant taste. There are some other fun breakfast cocktails and my wife loved the Gin and 'Treuse (featuring green chartreuse) and my mother enjoyed a Mimosa. <br><br>While brunch at the Publican did not blow me away, it certainly was very good and well worth experiencing if you want to try a high quality elevated play on typical brunch.

Meanwhile, three or four different servers were involved in ferrying dishes to our table, with a few bussers constantly hovering to fill water glasses. It was unclear who the waiter was when we wanted to pick up the check.  Although there were some gustatory highlights (the paté, cauliflower, bread plate, etc), the atmosphere was far from relaxing.

It worked. Also outstanding hams, traditional meat preparations (eg, porchetta) done well.

I always say I haven't been there before when I go just so that they will help me more picking out food. Some favorite dishes from my different times at the place: The pork belly and the farm chicken. Both of these dishes are so fantastic. If I could eat these two dishes for the rest of my life I would be thrilled. I find the atmosphere hilarious, but it definitely took my boyfriend aback at first.

I loved the ambiance (communal style seating, open kitchen, pleasant staff). I arrived about 25 minutes before my friend and we didn't have a reservation.They let me know that they could get us in at a table, but that a larger party was coming in about 2 hours later, and they had reservations for our table. I went ahead and took the reservation. My friend came, we ordered the brussels sprouts (sooo good!) and bread plate, the Farm Chicken and the Beef Tenderloin. Everything was good, but I generally don't eat pork so it was a bit disappointing to see that nearly everything on the menu had some type of pork - even the chicken must've been doused in the juice from the summer sausage because it had a weird porky taste. I didn't know this would be the case - or I would've told them to hold the juice. Other than the pork flavor, I could tell the food was very fresh and cooked well. The wine we had was good also (Domaine Des Champs). At the end of our dinner we stayed and chatted, and before we knew it, it was 9pm! The server politely came to us and asked if we'd be interested in another drink on the house at the bar (he needed our seats but that was a very gracious way of asking us to move!). I had totally forgot about the party coming in! This was a really nice display of service - I know some other restaurants that may not have handled this this way!

The execution was flawless and the flavor combo was again stunning.  Fish & cheese?  Yep, it worked wonderfully.  The zucchini was nice and al dente...really fresh flavor came through, which is hard to do when frying - never mind how great the perch tasted on its own.<br><br>Suckling pig:  nuff said.  I don't even remember the accompanying sauce/reduction/veg...the pork was so over the top...it just flaked apart with ease.  A1.  They killed it on one of their signature offerings, so bravo to treating the pig with respect.<br><br>I was also able to try some of the beef sirloin, which was done medium (even thought they suggested med-rare), and came with a crazy set up of cherries, crunchy hazelnuts and some crisp arugula.  I don't really eat beef/steak anymore, outside of occasional burgers, and this was a well crafted dish that even I enjoyed.<br><br>On top of the great food is great ambiance.  It's an insanely awesome interior design job...minimal European flair.  Really comfortable vibe and cool layout, with a ton of community seating in the middle, and the rest of the tables along the walls.  The whole place had a very casual vibe while still retaining a subtle, unpretentious chicness.<br><br>The service was very good, as well.  Maybe the quickest refills and plate takeaways I've ever seen...the runners were definitely on top of their game.  The wine list is short, but decent and the beers are even better - Zombie Dust on tap alone gets 5/5 stars. ;)<br><br>As far as after dinner ops went, a massive French press of a custom Intelligentsia blend was absolute heaven. Perfect temp and extraction.<br><br>The only thing that sort of missed was the panna cotta.  It was way too set, likely from being served at much too cold of a temperature.  The macerated sour cherries and pistachios on top were good in concept, but the sweetness of the cherries overpowered the delicate sweetness of the cream.  Oh well...a minor misstep.<br><br>Can't wait to hit this place up again.  Fan-effin'-tastic.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "MMMM publican.  the food is fantastic, the service is solid, oh but oh that seating in there.  They have family style seating and it is tight and cramped.  Also, don't expect to really have a private conversation, it's that close.  I would say that that is why this place doesn't get the 5 star rating in my book, because everything else was great.  The food, nom nom nom, the ambience of the place and decor was also nice.  Maybe best to go here in a group.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Let me just start by saying we are about as far from the target demographic of Publican diners as you can get. Why you ask? For starters, I'm a vegetarian, and if the gargantuan portraits of swine that line the walls are any indication, this place dabbles heavily in meat-centric fare, with a heavy emphasis on all things hog. Secondly, the group I was with had nary an adventurous eater in the bunch, though my dad does get an honorable mention for at least dabbling in some of the more out-of-the-box fare.<br><br>The layout of the restaurant has long tables in the center of the room where diners are seated communal style, with booths lining the perimeter (done in the style of a pen;  like I said, the swine theme abounds)...On a busy Saturday, we arrived at 8pm for our reservation, but our table wasn't ready, so we went to the bar area to have a round of drinks. Within 15 minutes, we were seated and greeted by our server. He explained the menu- this is done family style, though it is a bit confusing in terms of how large each plate is/how much food is necessary for a given group. It seems like typical diners order a good half dozen or more plates for a group of four. We ordered a handful of plates ourselves, with the main crux being vegetarian dishes (the chef even has a vegetarian special where they create a trio of veggie delights). This was one of the larger plates, along with the charcuterie plate (a large plate of several meat offerings, including sausages and meat pies). We ordered most of the vegetarian offerings, the best being the bbq carrots (incredibly flavorful with a spicy kick) and the strawberries, which were ridiculously tasty with a lively balsamic reduction. We finished by splitting the angel food cake dessert, a recent addition to the menu.<br><br>Beyond being a cool spot, the service is what truly garners Publican 5 stars. While many other trendy restaurants with inventive menus would have been quick to dismiss a group like ours that was so clearly out of our element, our server patiently helped us navigate through the menu and dining experience, all the while maintaining a healthy dose of humor. Bonus points to the adorable food runner who helped on our table as well- he definitely gave us some great laughs and added to the overall experience.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Heard great things about this place.

You feel instantly that this is the kind of place chefs would hang out and eat on their own--a kind of hangout for the culinary cool when they want to cozy up to a Sunday paper and coffee and get away from all the fancy garnishes and big steaks that often define Chicago's restaurants. <br><br>It's homey in very sceney, hip kind of way: a wide open, expansive dining space that at once says 'mess hall' as it does casual elegance. It comes down to you to read between the lines, though I'll confess, having patience for the hipper than thou waitstaff who seemed to be trained in charm by Anthony Bourdain would be helpful. It's by no means a quiet space--a large, open floor plan, the chatter of groups spreads and fills the restaurant. If you are looking for quiet or romantic, the Publican probably isn't for you, though owner Paul Kahan's Avec and Blackbird might just do the trick. Think of the Publican as their noisy, angsty brothe<br><br>There is a basic comfort about the food--a sort of unvarnished machismo that doesn't come off as shtick--big cuts of bacon, exceptionally tender poached eggs, pork chops, charcuterie, and the best soft pretzel I've found outside Germany. In some ways, the Publican is how you expect to eat in Chicago--the city of big shoulders should provide some hearty meals for those cold days--but my 5 years in the city found so few restaurants willing to be as cozy as the Publican.<br><br>They love their beer selection--lots of Midwestern gems, though few are totally surprising in this part of the world. Rather, its the sheer diversity and supply that makes the Publican a treat for beer aficionados. In recent years, though, the taps seem to have taken a back seat to craft cocktails. The Publican always was ready and well positioned to be your barkeep of choice when fresh ingredients meet top shelf liquor. Now that the trend has arrived, it's hard to decide if the Publican is a beer place or a cocktail place.

The reason that is the FIRST thing that comes to mind is really beyond me. Maybe I just associate that movie with every newspaper now. You got me.<br><br>After much deliberation on dates (and finding out what exactly The Publican actually was), I decided it was high time I try it out. My dad and I showed up pretty early on in the dinner rush thinking, rather naively I might add, that we would grab a drink somewhere close before heading over. After our options exhausted rather quickly, we decided to jump the gun on our reservation so when we arrived, the place was relatively empty.  This just gave me more room to take in the wonderful atmosphere.<br><br>The whole feeling of the place is awesome. It sort of plays out like a barn that you and your family might have used to gather for a weekly meal.  Of course it has a full bar and is completely renovated to seat more people than I thought could honestly fit in, but it always felt very homely.<br><br>The food really was delicious. We ordered up some of the country ham, country ribs and brown sugared sweet potatoes (which, to note, were OFF THE FIGURATIVE CHAIN.) Of course we tossed a few beers back from the fine selection of bottled and draft brews while we waited, just for good measure. But that's basically a given, right?<br><br>The only thing that was slightly odd was they have a policy to bring your food out as it is ready. Which is fine and sort of a fun thing to do I guess, but there was no warning as to how long certain courses took to prepare or how many other orders were before you, so the length of time in between courses was weird.  We had ham about 20 minutes in, then ribs 40 minutes later, then sweet potatoes 10 minutes after that.  I know I shouldn't be concerned with the order and small intervals at which my food comes out, but I couldn't wrap my head around the process.<br><br>All in all, I would definitely go back to this newspaper-named restaurant.

Not a place to take your hard-of-hearing parents, unless they don't care about conversing and just want to enjoy some good food.

We ended up having to wait over an hour and started to get antsy. <br><br>Having glanced at the menu earlier online, I knew we had to start with the waffle. It was crispy and very light, however it was accompanied with a honey butter and rhubarb compote. The compote was sweet and the honey butter was luscious. The combination of these with the waffle was heavenly. We moved onto the bacon plate and sausage sides. The bacon is more like a thick piece of pork belly placed on a tiny pool of maple syrup. Fatty and rich, it was pork candy. The sausage was not your typical breakfast sausage. It was the size of an Italian sausage;it was sweet and savory and fatty. The meal was going well so we decided to keep ordering. <br><br>We ordered the duck hash. When it came out it was quite small and I was nervous the bf wouldn't be full after this meal. The duck was rich, but the eggs were awesome. I am usually not a big fan of eggs and these blew my mind. They were creamy and buttery. Combined with the duck it was perfect. We ended our meal with a pecan sticky bun. Not your average sticky bun at all. More butter, pecans and fatty deliciousness. I was full and ready to pay.<br><br>This was when we started to get frustrated. The menu listed the sausage as a lower price than on the bill. Ok it was only a couple dollars, but still annoying.

They seated us at one of the side tables (non-communal) and found it to be a bit cramped, but nothing worth complaining about.

Cheese plate - (B-) A nice selection of cow/goat cheeses that proved a good paring with the Charcuterie and the honey spread that came with it, but nothing to blow doors down. <br>3. Ceviche - (F) Definitely the weakest part of the meal. It was outrageously priced for what you receive (which was not the case with the other dishes). The fish was not flavorful at all and there was barely enough to have four small bites. Fail. <br>4. Chicken Liver Pate w/ blueberry sauce - (A)  Good God this was tasty. My favorite part of the meal, the blueberry sauce put on top of the pate was the perfect cut for the richness of the plate. The crostinis were fantastic that came with the dish and when we ordered extra bread, they brought us some with no charge or wait. <br>5. Porchetta plate - (C+) This was good, but sadly not great like the sandwich I had before. It was very fatty, like even for me and I rarely give a s*** about an overly fatty dish, but it detracted from the dish due to the texture. The meat was juicy and tender, but a bit of a let down. <br>6. Pork Belly - (B) This dish was the least fatty of the choices I expected to be chubbish. The pork fell apart (in a good way) and was well-seasoned. Darn good. <br>7. Tuna (blanking on further details) - (A-) Fantastic. Second best part of the meal.

She was very knowledgeable about the food and drink menu( she gets extra points for knowing what beer I ordered without having to look at the menu... Lol.). Her service was perfect, unfortunately I forgot her name....<br><br>Next the drink menu. The drink menu was almost as impressive as the food. Let me say, that I've never been to an establishment that had EVERY beer that I love. This place did! Whoever made that beer list could be my best friend ,( cellared Trappist Roquefort 10, are you kidding me?!?). My date was also very satisfied with the wine list and her choice of wine, which was very good also.<br><br>  On to the food. I tend to judge any restaurant's food that has octopus on the menu almost solely by the how they perform with that one dish. The Publican's octopus dish was the best octopus I've ever had. I've had octopus in some very well established eateries and none of those could hold a candle to The Publican's octopus. <br><br> We also ordered the Spanish style seafood stew, the frites w/ egg and the aged duck breast. All of those dishes were wonderful.

We got a Serrano half order - should have gone for the full. The table l loved it. Enjoyed the bread plate with the sample 3 spreads. The cheese was the favorite. The also made a butter in house as a spread, but it didn't have any salt in it. I felt like they could have added something to their own butter for a little bit of taste. The half chicken order was HUGE. Like for the 6 of us it was just fine and we had leftovers. The chicken was good.The sausage on the chicken plate was extremely salty. I love sausages and pork and did not enjoy this unfortunately. Remember you are trying many plates. We had 2 veggies - the beets (table favorite) and BBQ carrots (not a fan).

Go for brunch. You can eat brunch for $10-20, and you won't be sorry. Order the bacon plate ($7) for the table. It's very thick-cut and fatty in a way that melts in your mouth, and it's doused in maple syrup. I've had the chicken fried steak (4 stars), the hanger steak with grilled peaches (5 stars) and the red wine poached eggs with prosciutto (4 stars). <br><br>2. At dinner, order the whole chicken. It comes with fries and could easily feed a small table. No one wants to order chicken at the Publican because there are so many more intriguing options, but if you do, it will be one of the best chickens you've ever tasted.<br><br>Finally, the interior is beautiful. The restaurant is in the old meatpacking district and the decorations are pig-themed. At the bathroom (which has fantastic soaps), you wash your hands in a communal trough. If you sit on the main wall you will sit in a booth with swinging doors, like a pig stall. The wooden fixtures, big ball lights, and old-timey pig pictures will surely win over even the coldest, most meat-loathing of hearts.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I used to love this place and recommended it to everyone I know.  Convinced a few friends to join me for brunch.  Service was horrible.  Took 30 mins until our server finally take our orders.  Not pleasant and no smiles.  Didn't even come to check on our food.   My toast was burnt, like black burnt.  From the long wait, poor service and food not that great anymore-I won't be back.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I'm the umpteenth person who has reviewed The Publican, but I'm happy to add to its praises. <br><br>The vibe of the place is awesome.

We'd ordered a radish dish that was essentially a mound of whipped butter with salt and a small handful of really small radishes. The oysters were delicious, I'm told, but the hamachi plate was oddly - disconcertingly - fishy.<br><br>8. The fries/egg/truffles dish came and visually, it was amazing. They were VERY generous with the truffles; as they should be, as the dish goes up by $24 with their addition. We'd gotten this order specifically upon the server's recommendation, so imagine our dismay when we went to stab the yolks for dribbly golden goodness only to find that they'd overcooked them. Horribly. They were over-hard instead of a lovely, gooey sunny-side up. One of my companions suggested that maybe that was how it was supposed to be (which would not make sense, in my opinon), but when our server came we asked and he'd said the eggs were supposed to be runny and he graciously offered to send out a replacement plate, even though we'd eaten the first one because we were hungry. The replacement plate, unsurprisingly, came without the truffles, which made me chuckle. <br><br>9. The farm chicken is SO GOOD. It's moist and flavorful, if a touch heavy on the oregano. The spicy pork rinds were CRACK, I tell you. The porchetta was gorgeous, as was the pork belly. The ribeye was perfect; nice and red and juicy.<br><br>10. Aforementioned busser returned to collect some plates and he misunderstood that one of my companions was asking to keep a plate that he wasn't quite finished with. So when he picked it up and walked away and my friend asked him if he'd please return the plate with the fries, the busser walked back the few steps to the table, fairly flung the dish down and HISSED at my friend, \"You don't respect me!\" This was...appalling. I was a server for 8 years; part of the job is not taking any perceived slight personally, and definitely not acting upon it and/or lashing out at a customer. The busser never returned to our table, but shot us daggers from the nearby tables - really! I saw him and looked over because another one of us at the table said he was giving us the death glare and he was!<br><br>We are not problem diners, I promise.

I liked the French Kiss the best; hubby liked the Wellfleet the best. For me it just has to not taste fishy at all so others were fishy to me. I like oysters with Tobasco and Horseradish; but I had to ask but I had not asked for horseradish because I thought that was what the included little sauce dish was but it wasn't oh well. It tasted sour and there was a  kinda garlic texture ingredient in there. We liked the crackers that came with too; It's a great contrasting taste, cleans your palate. We also got the half order charcuterie plate. My hubby wished we got the full order. He enjoyed the sausage, headcheese, and the yellow mustardy sauce. I liked the headcheese a lot.

I wished there was a little bit more kick to it like spice then it would have been perfect. I really liked the peanuts in there the best out of all the garnish that was on top. I didn't like the dragon tongue beans but hubs did. The meat itself was so fatty again but just melts in your mouth again. Wow.

And yes, that's a bold and ballsy statement to make when Chicago has SO many good restaurants.<br><br>I came here on Saturday evening to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday, and had made a reservation through Open Table for 7pm. I requested one of the private tables specifically in the request, and the majority of the diners are seated at a large table in the center of the restaurant.  It's not a huge deal, but if you're looking for a more private dinner, I'd highly recommend requesting this in your reservation.  We were seated in one of the \"pig stall\" tables where you're literally boxed into a table that resembles an animal's stall. While this kind of freaked out the one vegetarian diner in our party, we enjoyed how secluded we felt while in the stall. <br><br>Upon being seated, we were shown the menu and given a quick run-down on the way it works. All of the food is supposed to be ordered at once so that they can bring it out in courses, and all of the items are intended to be shared. Since we had a vegetarian in the group, it kind of created a lack of flow later in the night, but that was to be expected. Before we started picking apart the menu to decide what we wanted, we shifted our focus to the expansive beer menu to pick out a few unique brews. They have an extensive Belgian offering, which was to our liking.<br><br>As for the food, this was the second time I was at the Publican and I was blown away. We decided to order the following:<br><br>1) The Daily Pickles<br>2) Chicken Liver Pate<br>3) Pork Belly (Obviously, you have to get this here)<br>4) Boudin Blanc<br>5) Bollito Misto<br>6) Octopus<br>7) Fried Cauliflower<br><br>The Daily Pickles came out first, and it took us by surprise. We all were thinking that it would be a plate of pickles, but nope, it was a variety of pickled vegetables. There was picked red onion which was a spicy vinegar infusion of flavor that was outstanding. There was also pickled cauliflower that was bright yellow and was surprisingly delicious. Lastly, there were lightly pickled cucumbers which tasted like bread and butter pickles. This dish was so amazing that it was gone within a minute (and I'm barely exaggerating here) and we put in another order as it was only a whopping $4. The Octopus came out next, which is what the vegetarian member of our party ordered. She let us each sample a piece of it, and I really enjoyed this dish. Normally I'm not a fan of grilled calamari due to its rubbery texture, but this was about as far away from it as you could get. It had a nice bite to it and was wonderfully flavored. My only regret of the evening was that we hadn't ordered this for the whole table. The pork belly came out next, which is a tried and true dish that is executed perfectly here. The artichokes, olives, and grits really enhanced the flavor, and it was gone all too quickly. Next up was the Bollito Misto which came in a cast iron pan and was piping hot. The medley of tender, well flavored meats simmering in a salsa verde sauce was amazing. It reminded me of a soupy-stew that had a sampling of a wide range of meats and veggies. I really enjoyed this dish. Lastly, for the main courses, the boudin blanc arrived. This was simply a white sausage on a bed of veggies. To be honest, this was my least favorite dish of the night as it wasn't very interesting. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but it just lacked a certain something. <br><br>After all of these items came out, we had to wait about 10 minutes for the fried cauliflower. I think there was some kitchen mishap as I overheard a few other tables asking about it and the waitress seemed a bit flushed. Regardless, the fried cauliflower was worth the wait. It was lightly breaded and cooked to perfection--not at all mushy and it had a nice crunch to it. The cauliflower was served over a green chili sauce that was extremely tasty.<br><br>Lastly, to finish off the meal, we went with their waffle with maple ice cream, peanut brittle, and peanut butter hot fudge sauce. I have had their signature waffle in the past, but this one blew it out of the water. The maple ice cream paired with the waffle was a nice touch, as this was a tribute to the classic waffle and maple flavor combination. Although, with the addition of the peanut butter fudge and the peanut brittle, the waffle was incredible. This is a dessert that you have to get, no matter how full you are, and if it's on the menu.<br><br>The service here is also top notch--your water glass will rarely ever reach the point of being empty and they are prompt with drink orders. Our waitress was extremely nice, and struck a great balance with checking in on us just enough to not be intrusive. She also had a great sense of humor and great recommendations.<br><br>As a final note, the Publican gave my boyfriend a free cupcake for his birthday with a candle.

Very fresh, I swear they must fly their oysters out to the midwest often!  <br><br>The vegetables:<br>- POREINI & KING MUSHROOMS: Definitely one of my favorite dishes.

The poached eggs were thoroughly cooked, rendering the dish very dry . I almost asked for butter for my dry biscuit. . My friend had the Duck Confit but did not finish it stating it was super salty.

I've worked in restaurants - do they run partial trays now???   Furthermore, from where I was seated I could  see the waitress and a male arguing near the kitchen. nice, The waitress brought Pork and Beans as a substitute to the salty Duck Confit.

You guys can keep your oysters because when larger than life paintings of pigs adorn the walls, I know where Paul Kahan's devotion lies: the lowly swine. <br><br>We arrived half an hour early but were cheerfully greeted and shown to our table immediately. Our waiter quickly appeared (I don't believe he ever gave us his name), told us about the menu and beer list and left us to peruse the day's offerings which, unfortunately, did not include the pork rinds. Our disappointment soon vanished, though, with the arrival of The Taste of Three Hams, which sounds like a demented fairy tale and tastes like a dream. <br><br>Little did we know that things were about to get even better. <br><br>Next, we were presented with the pork belly. The acid in the broth and the tomatoes is the perfect counterpoint to the fat of the pork belly. It was tender and roasted so that the crisp layer around the outside was caramelized and oh-so-lovely. Dreams of that pork belly will haunt me now and forevermore. <br><br>What would have been a four out of five review became a solid five due solely to the pork belly dish. It's just that delicious.<br><br>The lamb sausage is also tasty. Served in a curried yogurt with fresh, green chickpeas and carrots, it is spicy and savory and so good. We also had the farm chicken with summer sausage and frites, which were good, but after the pork belly (the pork belly!) and lamb sausage, it was not exactly the highlight of our dinner. <br><br>For our sides, we had the daily pickles which pair perfectly with pork. We also opted for the shaved brussels sprouts with grilled onions, lemon and mint. <br><br>Word to the wise: do not skip the shaved brussels sprouts. This side dish was absolutely fantastic. <br><br>As for the service, it was flawless even though our waiter was a bit awkward at times. Our water glasses were never empty, one beer glass was quickly replaced with another and aside from an inexplicable lag in the arrival of the farm chicken, our plates came out one right after the other. <br><br>I don't know what anyone else is talking about with regard to the value. We left The Publican perfectly sated and very happy with our evening. For three people, six beers, four plates to share and two vegetables, with tip our dinner was under $150. Seems fair to me. <br><br>Do yourself a favor, do not skip the pork at The Publican.

I suggest coming with 4 people so you can try more than just a couple plates while keeping the price down. We still ended up trying 4 different things: the aged ham sampler, the sweet potatoes, the fries with egg and the scallops. I'm not a scallops guy, the consistency makes me gag, but my wife loved them. The fries were just french fries with an over-easy egg on top... can't go wrong here.

The group of 5 was in town for business and having a great time. They were super friendly, telling us all about the dishes they got, recommending stuff, and just generally being friendly people. The group of 4 was a younger married couple and one of their parents. The father in the group saw me take out my cell phone one time for about 10 seconds as my wife was doing the same. It was the only time we took our phones out the whole meal (we like to \"Check-In\" on Foursquare to see if there are deals), yet the old man would constantly ask us if we were texting each other... the whole meal. We never took our phones out again, but he continued to ask whether or not we were going to text each other... He seemed like a nice guy, but it was extremely annoying. So just beware that a crotchety old man who doesn't understand technology, or assumes that because you have your phone out for 10 seconds that you can't sit and talk to your wife, could be sitting next to you possibly ruining your meal.

When we were seated, we waited for about 20 minutes for Nick, our server to come to the table or even be acknowledged by anyone. We ordered three things to share. The pickles, the ham tasting and the country rib. Nick let is know that we didn't order enough food. As I knew I wanted to try a couple of desserts, we knew it was plenty for us. Well, no pickles, no ham, but about 35 minutes later our rib arrived. Nick didn't seem to notice, so I asked it it seemed odd that we got the rib first. He said yes and magically appeared with the pickles.  We still never saw the ham. Finally, after sitting there for an good 15 mintures more, we  let Nick know he could scrap the ham and we'd take the check and let him turn the table. A nice manager came over to apologize. She bought the food that we did get, although we said multiple times that she didn't need to do that. She did however blame it on the craziness from the NRA show. Yes, that is why we are in town too.

Additionally, there were stalls, and I really do mean stalls, as you got into your booth and doors shut behind you, making you feel like you're in a stable. Sadly, we did not get to eat in the cattle cars; instead, we were eventually seated at the communal table.<br><br>I will say this: aside from everything else, I find this gimmicky and stupid and awful. The wood is gorgeous, the ambiance lovely, and then it's all ruined by having to sit next to another group. This is not the way this country works any more, I don't think. We value our privacy and our pigeon cooping too much. VALUE MY PERSONAL SPACE, I say. I choose to broach conversation with few.

The goat butter tasted...like butter, shockingly, and the bread was fine. The pig, though, was excellent. Thinly sliced and each of the three types of pig had very distinctive tastes, to the point where I loved two and hated one for being too smoky.<br><br>3) We also shared frites with two eggs, frites just on their own with a side of aioli, and a cone of pork rinds. The frites with two eggs were quite good, but the eggs actually got in the way of the perfection of the fries themselves -- somehow managing to be super-crisp on the outside but soft and moist on the inside, well-seasoned but not overbearing, and not really needing the aioli either. In and of themselves, they showed what a potato can do and I could quite seriously have an entire meal of these little miracles.<br><br>The pork rinds were just too odd for me to appreciate them. I'm sure that, for pork rinds, they are quite good, and I got a couple bites in where the paprika and other seasonings were blended deliciously, but the pork rinds themselves?<br><br>Imagine breathing in a mist. Made of ham.<br><br>It's just too strange.<br><br>4) Also ordered: \"little gem salad\" with a decadent buttermilk and basil vinaigrette and \"head cheese croutons\". If you are saying \"what the what?\" to the concept of croutons made of head cheese, you are not alone. However, what they turned out to be were deep fried X, where X is anything you've ever had deep-fried ever. It tasted good. What can I say?<br><br>5) One of the smaller dishes we shared was sturgeon: fish, with bacon on top, some creme fraiche and a lot of dill. It was SO good. I only had a bite, because coming were: a giant bowl of mussels, which were floating in a broth of the essence of savory. The mussels came with a little rhomboid prism of bread, and dipping it in that broth was one of the highlights of the night. The mussels themselves were quite good, too, but that broth!<br><br>6) For the piece de la resistance: sirloin beef tips, cooked medium rare, and sliced in such a way as everyone could get their fill.

So not only are they now out of french toast but he just finally managed to put the order in. This guy had the never to bluntly ask me \"whatta want instead?\"!<br><br>HOW THE F$#K should I know what I want without seeing a menu genius, so I had to ask for a menu. At this point I was pissed off and just ordered the first thing I saw,  zucchini bread with pears.

Fantastic with the sticky buns, which were perfectly cooked with a soft chewiness and caramel-like coating. <br><br>For our main course I got the fried oyster omelette with tabasco croutons and my wife got the Fried French Toast with Maple Sausage. We split a side of bacon, which was a thick cut hunk of the cured pork belly braised in maple syrup. Best. Bacon. EVER. The omelette was fantastic as well, nice fresh oysters with a light crisp breading, and paired really well with the Hefeweizen I ordered (I knew the style is great with brunch, and it didn't let me down). My wife's French Toast had a delicious caramelized crust surrounding the custardy inside, and the maple sausage had the perfect balance of maple flavor and wasn't too greasy.<br><br>Publican's strength is in the fact that all of their dishes are made in house from start to finish, even their bacon and sausage.

Call me crazy, but I am not a fan of eating extremely expensive food in an environment inspired by a slaughterhouse.

I just know someone is having a good laugh at the idea that people will pay a lot of money to sit in a pen and get treated like an animal and that idea haunted me through out my meal. Not only is eating in a pen fairly claustrophobic, but it gave the restaurant a Patrick Batemen-esque vibe that I cannot forgive. <br><br>I will say that the food was okay, but not enough to make up for the unpleasant seating, or really even good enough to justify the cost. We ordered two things I had heard people rave about (the pork belly and pork rinds) and thought both were pretty average. My group of four split three desserts and I can honestly say that I disliked ALL of them. The trifle tasted like it had croutons in it, I kid you not. And there is something offensive about selling a perfectly ordinary waffle with butter and jam for $7! My favorite dish was actually the brussels sprouts, served on a bed of cheese, which was very tasty.

I had originally made a reservation for two, but the hostess was kind enough to let us add another person to the party last minute as the restaurant wasn't too packed yet at 10:30am. It was a smart decision to come here with a reservation, because the giant space filled up unbelievably quickly and a huge crowd littered the area outside the entrance by the time we headed out a little past noon. <br><br>The brunch menu here was so promising that I actually had an incredibly difficult time ordering. I ended up going with the red wine poached eggs, sourdough and bernaise, served with la quercia prosciutto and a lightly dressed baby arugula salad. The riff on a mundane eggs benedict was something special, and the slight acidity from the red wine actually worked and made the dish surprisingly light. The bf ordered the pork belly bibimbap with kimchi, brown rice and a fried egg which he really seemed to enjoy. Our friend went the sweet route with the beautiful looking waffles with an apple-plum jam and honey butter that totally made me green with envy. I only wish that I could have stolen a bite from his plate, if only he didn't possess such a big appetite. To accompany our entrees, we also ordered the obligatory maple braised publican bacon, hashbrowns, and sausage on the side. The thick slabs of bacon were certainly everything everyone makes them out to be - buttery, sweet and salty - a perfect symphony of flavors. <br><br>Besides the great food, I also really dig The Publican for their emphasis on craft beers and unique brunch cocktails. Bloody marys here are not your average run of the mill stuff made with some store bought mix, but tangy and pungent with grated horseradish and a ton of pickled veggie garnishes. Now the kicker on those badboys is the beer served alongside the bloody marys, and my Zombie Dust was perfectly hoppy and bright. Who would've thought that beer would go so well with a bloody mary! The bf's publican mimosa, made with a Belgium Blanche and freshly squeezed OJ was great as well, a little \"manlier\" than the average mimosa I suppose. <br><br>The Publican really represents what I've come to love about the Chicago food scene; the casual yet totally exciting cuisine in a genuinely fun, unpretentious environment is something NYC still lacks.

Our waiter was also very helpful with suggestions for both beer and food, even though he suggested to order wayyyy more dishes than we could actually consume.<br><br>Cons:<br>- We had made a reservation for 4 and our 4th was running late (and eventually couldn't make it). They wouldn't seat us until our 4th showed, and when we realized he wasn't coming, they gave away our table under a BS guise that the group \"had had this reservation for like, 3 weeks.\" Okay, Hostess Lady, I don't believe you, but that isn't going to seat me sooner so I'll smile and play nice. Just note that they won't seat you until your full party has shown up.<br>- It was loud, but I suppose that's part of the charm. This was originally supposed to be a working dinner, but since we put the laptops away, it wasn't too terrible.<br>- The food came out extremely rapid-fire, which was nice because it was all fresh and hot, but hard to manage everything coming out so quickly!<br><br>And now, the most important part -- the beer/food!<br><br>To start, I asked our waiter for a beer suggestion -- my favorite are Hefeweizens/lighter beers, to which he immediately suggested the Weihenstephaner Vitus..

It was so good, I think I may have a new favorite!<br><br>Anyways, since we were hungry, we started laundry-listing pretty much anything we even sort-of thought looked good.. and our waiter even suggested we should order more than we listed. I think we went with about 8-10 dishes in total.<br><br>Here were some of my favorites:<br><br>Tomato salad - overall, my favorite dish of the night. I know, I was faced with some ridiculously amazing stuff, but I really really REALLY enjoyed this salad. I wasn't too sure of it because um, who puts tomato, watermelon, yogurt and dill together on a plate?! But it all worked so nicely and was very light and refreshing.<br><br>Smoked salmon on toast - Came with some sort of dipping sauce that was absolutely delicious. <br><br>Mussels - pretty standard as compared to other steamed mussels in broth, but the bread that was served with it was actually really good. Super crusty and warm - yummy and perfect for zope'ing!<br><br>We also got fries (which I didn't care for, but another in my party liked them a lot so I guess it's a matter of taste), flank steak (cooked perfectly.. very raw/still moo'ing.. happy happy), and snapper over lime beans and roasted red peppers.. it was all so delicious, but needless to say, it was a lot of food, and after we finished all of that we realized that we had ordered about 3 MORE plates.. to which we told our waiter enough! .. Where is the dessert menu??? :)<br><br>For dessert, we got a cup of the sour cherry sorbet (good, but a little too sour) and the waffle with salted cashews and ice cream.

The lighting looks beautiful from outside, but seems too bright and too dim at the same time. Not a comfortable place to have a drink with friends. Drinks to impress your boss, perhaps.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I'll join everyone else when I say the atmosphere and décor are top notch and not done justice through pictures. It's a lively \"beer hall\" style experience with communal tables and a standing bar area. The room has a nice rumble of noise emanating from happy eaters and drinkers. It's a place that encompasses happy people all sharing a similar experience drinking and eating good food. The beer list is quite interesting and full of choices you might not find in many places in Chicago. Don't expect to find $3 bud lights or PBRs and most beers are large format with large format type prices.<br><br>We ordered a lot of food not because we were particularly hungry but because we wanted to sample what was on the menu that evening. For starters we had an order of pork rinds, French fries with an egg on top and steak tartare. I could stop right there and explain how eating those dishes would be more fat and cholesterol that I would want to consume in an entire week. But as they say, \"when in Rome\"...I've never been a pork rind fan and that didn't change much after some of ones I had. If you get a good one that is light and airy, I can see the appeal. I also had one that was super tough and a potential tooth breaker. Oh well, maybe it's a sign. Not surprising the fries with egg was awesome. What could be better than fried potatoes with eggs? Sounds like breakfast to me. We both were disappointed in the steak tartare - it tasted a bit more chewy and rare than the better ones I've had. It also lacked some basic flavor and seasonings. You shouldn't be reminded that you're eating raw meat.<br><br>The two fish dishes we tried were the squid and sablefish. I didn't mind nor didn't love the squid dish. It was served with a nice brown rice and some greens with avocado. The raw squid is exactly what it sounds like, raw little octopus guys. Not a whole lot going on without a lot of flavor either, but that's the appeal of raw seafood right? The smoked sablefish was an interesting fish I don't think I've had before. It was served on rye bread with fromage blanc, beets & endive. The dish was well presented and cooked, though I imagine sablefish is a strong flavor that you either like or don't like. I'm in between but probably leaning on don't like since I doubt I'd run back to order that dish again.<br><br>We went with two meat dishes, blood sausage and spare ribs. I actually liked the blood sausage even though I definitely don't want to know how that's made. There were a lot of good and interesting flavors with a texture I could handle. The spare ribs were not my favorite and more challenging to eat than I expected. As Brendan noted, they gave you the whole darn rump, with all the fat and cartilage intact. Even if the meat was tasty it was very hard to get at without a lot of work or consuming \"the extras.\" We also ordered a side of ramps, a.k.a. wild leeks, something I had never tried before. I enjoyed them and the basic presentation but flavorful sauce and cooking flavors. I guess it's a unique taste a la collard greens or similar root vegetables. Maybe I was just craving something green after all the pork and meat.<br><br>I had a few great beers but could not tell you which ones because I just asked our server to bring me something good. When it was all said and done the check arrived and I was definitely surprised. Yes, we ordered a lot of food and didn't eat all of it but looking at a $160 bill for two is still a little startling. And apparently that's not uncommon from what I could gather. So what's my takeaway? It's a great place to hang out and drink with a very tailored menu. If you're not a huge pork or oyster/raw bar person I don't know if it's a good fit. I can see the talent of the kitchen in their product even if it's not something I'd order every day or ever again. Everyone raves about two things I have yet to try: the pork belly and the Sunday brunch (one of the best in town?). While it may not become a favorite go-to for me, I'd suggest everyone to check it out in case the food matches the impressive décor, service and drinks (but bring your larger wallet).", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Went back to Publican over the weekend and had a very enjoyable Brunch. <br><br>Service was very good from our server to our attentive busser who made sure that we were always looked after.

The  belgian weissbier was pretty delicious and it was my first time trying a lambic as well! <br><br>Now for the food:<br>-chef's selection of oysters: They were all fresh and delicious. I will def try them again next time<br>-chicken liver pate: the bread was well toasted and pate was smooth and creamy. not bad at all<br>- 3 ham sampler: The ham was extremely good quality and the lard that comes is 10x better than butter! <br>-arctic char: not much fish for the price but the fish was fresh and delicious. The eggplant that comes with it was an interesting addition. crisp and light (not what I normally expect out of eggplant)<br>-whole chicken: this was the highlight of the meal! Normally not a fan of chicken at restauarants since I eat it so much on a daily basis but this was cooked to perfection. The rotisserie cooking touch made the meat so tender and the juices made the fries amazing<br>-Corn: the corn was 10 bucks for a small plate. well seasoned but not worth the price. <br>-ham chop: 42 dollars for a ham...is it christmas already? It was a lot of meat for the price but only the marbled fat parts were good. there was plenty of dryness in the non-fatty parts so I won't be trying this again.<br><br>Service was good and the communal dining room gives it an interesting setting.

What a feast. Publican has it all covered. <br><br>I can't believe it has taken me this long to get to this West Loop gem. This place kind of reminds me of a cross between comfort food and a beer hall. There are a bunch of long wooden tables for communal dining and some two tops surrounding them. There are also a few pig pen type tables with barn doors that looked cute. Huge pictures of large swines are all around, just in case you didn't notice what they specialize in here. <br><br>If you are a less adventurous diner or on a diet, this may not be the place for you. Located right in the heart of the meat packing district, you can get practically anything you'd like here. It seems like they serve it all, from the rooter to the tooter. Heart, sweetbreads, rabbit, pork rinds, charcuterie and foie gras are all here for you. Plenty of options for fish or veggies, if you don't feel like satisfying your inner carnivore. Pony up and let's strap on the feedbag, shall we? This menu is perfect for sharing, so you may want to go with a group. It was a bit tough for us to navigate our way through the menu as it is more tapas style and nothing seemed clearly appetizer or entree. We started with the beet salad and burrata. This was an excellent start. The yellow beets were really tasty and nicely paired with the creamy burrata. We also had the pretzel with Bavarian mustard that reminded me of those enormous ones that we wolfed down over many beers at the Hofbrauhaus. My wife had the sea bass as her main. I had the half hog they call the \"Ham chop in hay\". When this platter of swine hit the table, I felt like calling over other diners for back up. This gigantic portion must have had about a dozen chops and ribs. It wasn't until I had worked my way through a few of them that I made it to the flavorful grits and ramps underneath. This dish was a winner and I'm pleased to report that I put away most of it. I wanted to save room for dessert and I'm glad that I did. Double chocolate cake with bourbon county stout caramel, bananas and coffee ice cream. That satisfied a chocolate fix very nicely and the french press coffee was great too. I did say it reminded me of a beer hall didn't I? Hearty Belguims and Germans are on tap and if you can't find something to your liking there are a few dozen bottled global options. I really liked the Weissbier they had on tap and we had a couple of rounds of it. <br><br>Sadly, the service was a bit off. We were there early because we had a show to catch later in the evening. Although I discussed our situation with our server, he just couldn't keep us on schedule and we waited a good hour between courses. Dinner menus had not been printed when we were seated. Wrong dishes and drinks were constantly arriving at our table. Food arrived before we even had our first round. <br><br>Overall I really did like Publican. Paul Kahan's trifecta of culinary excellence has reinforced my rather biased belief that my West Loop home is the city's best restaurant area. I'm looking forward to returning for brunch or maybe just a few rounds.

We found ourselves waiting a little longer than we should have to order and the server was only helpful with ordering after being pressed a little bit for more info. Being unfamiliar with what \"small to big\" really meant as far as plate sizes went on the menu because it was our first time there, we asked about portion sizes and at first only received a canned response, again, about portions going from small to large in the menu sections.

The walls were covered in a terracotta like embossed print, a long gold-lined bar sat in front of the open kitchen, and bright globe lambs hung in a rectangular cluster in the center of the room.  Seating is essentially a small number of walnut booths equipped with their own saloon style doors, a few stand alone deuces and four-tops, a set of wooden communal tables organized into a rectangle with matching high-backed chairs and a few cocktail standing tables for drinking and snacks. As for décor, it's all about the swine. No sexy mirrors, no eclectic trinkets, just a few large paintings of even larger pigs.  A very appropriate way to commemorate the Jewish sins we were about to commit (just in case we didn't get our fix at the Purple Pig). From inside our little saloon cove, we felt the entire experience to be decidedly quite comfortable, warm and welcoming and the service to follow suit. <br>Our server was adorably cheerful for a dreary Saturday morning, helping us with our tourist inquiries and mapping out our shopping route for us. He also ensured our water and coffee cups were consistently replenished, and that side plates and cutlery were plentiful.<br>Speaking of drinks, the Publican offers all the morning classics- mimosas, G+ Ts, Bloody Marry, juice, coffee and tea. No cappuccino machine, unfortunately, so I had to opt for basic drip ($3), which I found a little bitter for my taste.  Thankfully, the food helped make up for it with a little extra salt and sugar to balance everything out. The Publican's brunch menu reads like a #foodporn fantasy, taking greasy spoon favourites up a few notches on the sexy scale. With global cuisine influences from Italy, Eastern Europe, Asia, there were no shortage of tempting picks- the challenge for us was going to try to be sensible and not order the entire menu for two. With a little help from our server, we ended up going with:<br><br>Smoked Arctic Char, Grilled Snap Peas, Radish, Yogurt, Poached Egg & Charmoula ($16)<br>A light and refreshing start to the day. Once cracked into, the yolk added incredible richness to the tangy yogurt, the fresh green peas, and the slightly bitter radish.  The fish had a lovely sweetness to it that was balanced out by the herbaceous and bright charmoula and a bit of aromatic curry seasoning throughout. If you're looking for a lighter brunch option, this would be ideal.<br> <br>Oven Baked Sourdough Pancake with Bacon-Wrapped Chicken Thigh, Breakfast Sausage, Burton's Maple Syrup ($13)<br>And if you're not looking for a light, healthy option, this is the one to choose. But believe me, it's totally worth it. The pancake was fluffy on the side, but deliciously crispy on the sides and bottom from a good searing in the cast iron pan. The bacon thighs and sausage were sweet, salty and just soaked up all that maple syrup to yield one unapologetically delicious bite. Love, love, love.<br> <br>Pub Pretzel with Lady Chris' Pimento Cheese ($4)<br>A stark shift in flavour profile from the latter dish, but still a pretty tasty snack. My first bite of the pimento cheese reminded me a bit of Cheez Whiz, but it wasn't long before I was hooked. The pretzel itself was really tasty- nice and tender inside, with a good satisfying chew on the surface. Yum.<br>So for 2 coffees, an OJ, 2 mains and a side, the bill came to about $50 including tax and tip. Not a cheapo diner breakfast, but definitely a worth-while meal. I loved the Eastern European communal atmosphere, and the food offerings were both familiar yet intriguing. Thanks Publican for getting us through a food coma with more delicious food. I would definitely be up for a repeat visit (maybe for dinner or late night drinks) any time I'm in Chicago again.

Well done!<br><br>I'm rarely ever moved by desserts but  the clafoutis had what you'd call the \"wow factor.\"  Imagine a combination of warm and cool, sour and sugary, creamy and chewy... I wish I could be more eloquent when describing this dessert but its tastes and textures were just a beautiful contradiction!   Round off the night with the house limoncello (the absolute BEST I have EVER had - even in Italy) or other house aperitifs and you'll be smiling all the way home.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "As a closet vegetarian, I'm so not a pork rinds kind of girl but lord! after watching the reactions of my colleagues to the puffed and powdered hot crisps peeking out of their papered cone, I had to just try one.

Two bottles of pinot and tastes of everything: a flaky, buttery dover sole; a tender roasted chicken that must have come from an enormous bird; and a plate of pickles so more-ish I could've dined on those and a beer alone. <br><br>The commitment to local farmers is also a big plus in my book.

Not really my style and I was starving by the time I got to Publican. Unfortunately, this was the only time they had that fit our schedule.

We could see all the dishes passing by and actually chatted with some random people who were standing at our bar table. The bf and I had the Brasserie St. Feuillien (abbey style), which was light and crisp, just the way I love my beer. They come in cute beer cups too.<br><br>15 minutes later, we were seated in a long communal table which I typically don't like but for some reason, I didn't mind this time. We chatted with a couple seated next to us and were recommended some dishes. Our waiter was \"typical\", nothing unique about him but he did know his dishes and did let us know that we would have more than enough dishes for the four of us. <br><br>Here is our list of food in the order it came out:<br><br>Dozen oysters (4 bagaduce, 4 kusshi, & 4 penn cove) - amazing oysters! so fresh and crisp.<br><br>Frites with George's organic eggs- Nothing spectacular but it was surprising how eggs go along with fries! You need to eat a piece of fry with a piece of egg and you will understand that it goes perfect.<br><br>Sweet Potatoes - AMAZING. How can sweet potatoes go so well with capers?  I dislike capers but it was crunchy and deliciousss. Best sweet potatoes dish ever! <br><br>Provencal fisherman's stew - mussels were so damn good! the sauce is savory too. You have to put the sauce inside with the mussel so you can eat it together. YUMMY YUMMY. <br><br>Lamb meatballs - There was only two meatballs but each couple got to share one. Although they weren't too big, they were pretty chewy and savory. Perfect.<br><br>Duck - SO GOOD. The skin was crispy and the meat was so unbelievably tender. IT WAS FANTASTIC.<br><br>At this point, my stomach was bulging and I was having trouble eating cause I was so full but I still wanted to try the remaining dishes so I had couple bites of the last two.<br><br>Chicken - When this dish came out, I was like Oh, here's a dish I won't like finally. It looks plain and simple.  WRONG! How do they get this chicken so tender? It was the best chicken hands down. I am not a huge fan of chicken, too much chicken gets me sick but I almost didn't want to put my fork down cause it was so good.<br><br>Ribs - Finally our last dish! Amazing amazing. Meat so tender, and sauce so tasty. <br><br>We didn't get to finish the last two dishes so we bagged it and quite frankly, everyone was super happy with this choice of restaurant. <br>YAY ME! <br>OK, so I give the food A plus plus PLUS. Interior is very unique and decorative with huge pictures of fat pigs (huh?!) It kind of reminded me of my fat dog. HAHA. Love high ceilings and I love the whole wood theme. I am not a fan of communal seating but it was a great experience here. The bathrooms are quite interesting but I got to say that I am a huge fan of it.

I stepped in to find myself in a restaurant lined with large wooden tables for communal eating, small tables for parties of 2, standing tables in the \"bar area\" and then special 4-top tables that felt like stables.  Each table had their own set of doors.  The minute I laid eyes on the special 4-top \"stable tables\", I hoped that we'd be seated there.  LOW AND BEHOLD... the hostess walked us over and seated us.  I was as happy as a kid in a candy store...  but I was more like a 26-year-old in a fancy schmancy butcher shop.  <br><br>What did we order?

I just can't bring myself to call it 5 stars. Some of the food adventures are inconsistent (like an apricot and ricotta side plate -- interesting concept, not executed well).

A-ma-zing! Went with three friends and we went tapas style and shared everything at the very keen insight of our waiter. <br><br>Started with the bloody mary with the beer chaser and it was nice and refreshing especially after a few too many cocktails the evening before. Then the fun began...red wine poached egg with prosciutto was absolutely delicious, schnitzel with eggs was awesome, omelet with fried oysters was good as well but not as much of a stand out as the first two. Lastly we had the waffle with berries and honey butter everything that a waffle should be--soft and crunchy, sweet but not too sweet. Great ender to the meal. We also shared plates of the maple braised bacon that was more like pork belly which is a good thing and the frites with fried eggs which is as awesome as you can imagine. <br><br>All in all it was a great brunch, one that i wouldn't do all the time but definitely for an occasion or when you're craving some a bit more decadent. A great experience, can't wait to go back for dinner!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "When my Ben-O first suggested a pork-eaters only dinner to me, further hinting that I am naturally not included while I am a fussy \"no-pork-on-the-fork\" kind of gal, I didn't feel oh so left out. His brother and brother's girlfriend were in town from Grand Rapids, particularly to explore the mind of master chef Paul Kahan; being that he is in lieu to be a recognized as a remarkably talented chef himself, I became a lil curious as to what it was that made him ooo and awe. But when Ben-O reposed, \"would you?\"...after those thought gears were going, I daringly answered \"...sure? why not? (will I regret this?)\". I will eat PORK this once without discrimination, I will eat whatever animal is put on my plate but I will also expect it to be great.<br><br>And Publican didn't fail. They accepted adding on another seat to the reservation last minute with no problems, \"sure thing, we will gladly expand our bill by another $100 consumer\".<br><br>The minute I walked in the place, I loved it. It's decor hit a heart-string. The oversized pictures of plump hogs peering over us - I like to be reminded of what I'm eating (only being partly sarcastic) ahem or appreciating. Warm large bulbed country-feel lighting suspended and arrayed every 2 feet from each other made an impact without being overpowerful. The uber-long L-shaped bench like tables surrounding the center and the wooden pen booths around the edges of the restaurant all tied to the feeling of a classy country-like experience; I couldn't help but imagine a green field outside the city building with the pig-pens an acre or so away from my plate. <br><br>The menu was 5-coursed and fixed on this day, being that it was the beginning of the \"craft brewers conference\" and \"world beer cup\" which is hosted in Chicago this year I later learned. Each dinner was carefully crafted and suited with an optional flight of beers per course. We did the whole shabang - beers with another round of 4 selected beers to share on the limbos of each course. And bonus for me only the starter round was pork.<br><br>And the menu goes (verbatim per their site): \"1) Jamon Iberico with fried morels and pickled fiddlehead fern paired with Pairie Path ale; 2) guinea hen, foie gras galantine with ramps orange mustard greens and cashew paired with Ebel's wiess; 3) crawford farm corned lamb mix grill with spring, rye, panzanella paired with Langhaul session ale; 4) bbq salmon paired with collaboration beer; 5) brown butter, orange, honey, coffee and almonds paired with Domaine duPage\"<br><br>I must admit, EVERY course was outstanding! Even the pork. My favorite was the salmon; I have just NEVER had salmon THAT GOOD. Then the guinea hen fois gras; wow. The beers were perfectly paired as well. Dessert was perfect! If ya have the chance and the financial liberty or dare, go catch this menu! Otherwise, rest assured that practically anything you will put in your mouth on their menu is probably amazing. <br><br>And sigh, tis over and the $$$ must surface. It was as dangerous to the wallet as I anticipated. A solid $100 per person. And it wasn't that hard a sacrifice to swallow considering how spectacular the experience was. I am just eager to have that steady income to sacrifice! If I had a consistent paycheck, I'd splurge here again.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The oysters were the size of a dime! Ridiculous.

It has the consistency of a beignet, and the compote that comes with it is fantastic.  no need for syrup.  I ordered the schnitzel and it was also fantastic.  HUGE portion.  We split a side of BACON, the BEST BACON EVER. Huge slices, super thick, perfect balance of fat and meat - DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>The food speaks for itself and we cannot wait to go back for round 2, where we hope to get the items they ran out of.  Our service for brunch was really good and overall we had a fantastic time.  The setting is great and the energy was really positive.  We witnessed an owner interacting with the kitchen staff and it was very amiable.  The executive chef is nominated for best chef of 2010 by Food and Wine Magazine, just another nod to how great Publican is!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Do yourself a huge favor and go eat here now.
