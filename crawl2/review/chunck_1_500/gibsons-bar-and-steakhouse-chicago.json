The waiters bring scrumptious warm breads to the table--overflowing. Enjoy dining in or sitting on their street-side patio. Gibson's is a wonderful place to head for lunch but can get busy in the summer, so get there early.<br><br>I returned to Gibson's and had their amazing homemade soup. It is called Bookbinders--full of tomato and flavor and fish. They serve it with thee small loaves of bread. It's sooooo good in the cold month. For dessert, I asked for carrot cake. What did I get? OMG. I got not a slice but a quarter of the cake that must weigh 5 pounds.

We came around 6:30 on a weeknight but the bar side is open seating and we found a table right away. Service was prompt and friendly, and she brought our bottle of wine rather quickly. For an appetizer, we split the wedge salad which was MASSIVE. Half was more than enough, and if I didn't have such a weakness for blue cheese I wouldn't have even finished it. I got a NY Strip steak and it was perfectly cooked medium rare, albeit with a very very salty crust. I love a good salted crust, but this was almost too much for me. My wife got the filet and asked for medium, but it came out medium rare. It wasn't a huge deal because she doesn't mind medium rare, but for a place of Gibson's caliber and price point, the steaks should come out of the kitchen exactly how you ordered them. My steak came with a salad/soup, and I had already had the wedge, but the only soup is split pea so I just picked at a second order of salad. <br><br>Overall a great meal, but in the future I'd expect a more consistently cooked steak from them.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/c90Tg_ODfm7rmGJ97pHjbA/348s.jpg", "caption": "HALF of the wedge salad for an appetizer.

I made a reservation online on the OpenTable app and there was a section that asked me if I was celebrating anything in particular so I selected the 'birthday' option, not thinking they would bring it up. Our reservation was for 9:30, we arrived around 9:15 and were asked to wait a few minutes as they prepared our table. The ambiance inside is very romantic and relaxing, there's a piano in the bar area and there was someone playing live music. After only 5 minutes we were sat before our reservation time (very convenient) in a very cozy area by the glass window facing the downtown street with a view of the Christmas decorations and lights outside. As we sat down, we were instantly brought bread and water along with menus. Only a few moments after that our waiter came and introduced himself and shook our hands, he mentioned he saw in our reservation that it was someone's birthday, and congratulated my boyfriend. I was so impressed that they actually pay attention to the details of online reservations. He came with a wooden plates of meats, he was so sweet and welcoming and explained each meat on the menu and showed us what to expect with each different option. The display and service of the restaurant is impecable! I was amazed with the presentation of just the display. We asked for recommendations and he was very knowledgeable. <br><br>We had a delicious meal, worth every penny. This was the best service and quality of food combined that I've ever experienced. After our dinner, our waiter brought us a complimentary dessert for my boyfriend's birthday and we sang happy birthday with a wonderful speech to follow (I'll include pictures and a video).<br><br>Our waiter's name was Joseph and he was by far he sweetest waiter I've ever had.

Like always, fish was fresh as hell and everything else was great. Also had the \"garbage salad\" which is a chopped salad with shrimp and a lot of other ingredients. Very fresh with some kind of great dressing. Service as always was right there, and never overwhelming like some places where they bother the hell out of you (i.e Chicago Cu....(shush)). People watching supreme on the square-or to Chicago people, the Viagra. Past times have sat out here with family, friends, clients and have had almost everything on the menu, like the great steaks, chops, crab legs, the best martinis, u name it. Always fantastic. I know dinner here can be really pricy, as other great (and not so great) Chicago steakhouses, but lunch is surprisingly reasonable as are their very, very good wines by the glass and even some by the bottle. Try this place for a very nice lazy Sunday lunch or brunch as they have breakfast items too. I will be back and back.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The filet was delicious.

Aside from that bump (which was quickly resolved by the rest of our experience) the night was absolute perfection.<br><br>Our server, Greg White, went above and beyond to ensure we received everything we wanted throughout the evening. Here's just one example: I ordered the Broiled Faroe Island Salmon for my entree and, in leiu of a side of brussels sprouts, shared the broccolini. When Greg saw us moving some of the broccolini to my plate (which was so flavorful I could have eaten it for my entire meal), I mentioned that I had wanted the brussels sprouts but no one wanted to share an order with me. The next time he returned to our table, he brought me a surprise order of them - they were delicious and everyone else in my party completely missed out. The salmon was cooked to perfection as well. The rest of my party sang the praises of their meals as well: filet sliders, filet mignon and the 27 oz. porterhouse.<br><br>When it came time for dessert, our group was so full, we couldn't even order cake for the birthday girl. Again, Greg went above and beyond. While we were waiting for the bill, he came out with the largest slice of chocolate mousse cake I've ever seen, complete with candles on top, to make sure the birthday was celebrated. Even though I was so full I was struggling to finish my wine, one bite of the cake and I knew it had to be finished otherwise I would regret it.<br><br>Overall, we had an incredible night and I've already decided to celebrate every special occasion, starting with Valentine's Day, with my fiance in Greg's section.

I was stuffed half way through, but pushed myself like a runner in a marathon and I am glad to say that I made it across the finish line. I finished the whole thing. It was massive. I'm proud of myself. The steak was perfectly cooked and had a nice crust on the outside of it. Delicious. <br><br>We ordered the twice baked potato as a side.

I honestly haven't dined there very often, but the quality of the meal and experience is simply preeminent. Showing up a few minutes early, my date and I were seated immediately. I regret not spending a little time at what I remember to be a well appointed bar, but I had just come from a wonderful Happy Hour at Hugo's, next door, and could not complain about prompt seating. The hostess also offered to take our coats... and though we declined, it's a very nice touch.<br><br>The service was stellar, as expected. Our waiter ran down the available list of soups and recommended Merlots and Malbecs as those are our favorite steak pairings. I was a little bummed that the beef barley soup was not available as it was on their website... but it looks as though they try and keep the online menu current by the day, so I can't fault them too much about it. The split pea soup that they were offering did not peak my interest, so we skipped straight to the entree. Porterhouse.<br><br>A photograph of this formidable cut of meat from a fellow Yelper helped seal the deal on an easy decision. I'm not a huge fan of a la carte service. Of course, you expect it in most every high-end steakhouse, but the price is driven up shamelessly. I had my eye on the NY Strip, which Gibson's righteously offers as table d'hote. Be that as it may, the porterhouse photo had my mouth watering, and the decision was made. <br><br>I tore through the top loin side of my carnivorous cut with veracity and satisfaction. It's entirely possible this was accomplished with little regard for my own dignity.  The filet cut of a porterhouse is a delicacy, to be sure... however, the more substantial feel of the top loin is a gratifying part of my best steakhouse experiences. This time was no exception. As I write this review, the orphaned filet waits eagerly in my fridge, prepared for consumption as a sumptuous dinner or bold tasting breakfast.<br><br>I mentioned earlier, my dispositive attitude toward a la carte service. Not only, however, does Gibson's offer certain cuts of meat as table d'hote, they do not skimp on portion size or quality when it comes to their sides. I can absolutely recommend the blue cheese scalloped potatoes. A terrific flavor on their own, but also paired perfectly with the steak. I recommend frying those up in some eggs if you're lucky enough to depart this venue bearing left-overs. The asparagus were huge and tasted good... but I'm a fan of the vegetable being on the smaller side and cooked to a slight char, or caramelization. I find they tend to be more flavorful that way.<br><br>So Gibson's has not stopped living up to it's own stellar reputation.

My interests are on the quality of the food, and for the most part, Gibson's, when they get it right, most certainly has. It was my son whose 17th birthday we were celebrating last Saturday that asked me what my favorite restaurant was or where would I go to eat?I have never had an inconsistently excellent meal at Gibson's and service has never been an issue. <br><br>Everything was going great. The waitress was very pleasant and we were nice in kind. When we ordered my son repeated his order very clearly straight from the way it was worded on the menu. We even ask a few very specific questions and had a conversation with her about the tomahawk chop - which is $100, btw. About 15 minutes after we finished soup/salad, she came by and said our food was cooking. It was 20-25 minutes later she showed up again, having already served a party of 4 to our left who came in after us, with cold sides, my steak was cold and she dropped lamb in front of my son. When she said \"and here are your lamb chops\" it was with a complete lack of confidence.\"<br><br>The illusion disappeared in an instant. If I was not with my son, I may have walked out. I understand people make mistakes but late, cold and wrong in a restaurant where you're dropping $300 for two people (and on a birthday) is unacceptable. Even if you rest a steak for 10 minutes, it will not be cool. So our order must have sat for an additional 25 minutes or so overall. The manager came by but he was half-hearted. After several visits he comp'd some wine and sides but I'd rather have paid for the right experience. When they did bring his tomahawk chop, it was small, more burnt than charred and undercooked. The manager came by and my son was not eating it. It wasn't cooked correctly but my son didn't want to say anything at that point because there was enough tension with the situation - as he told me later. He said \"is there a reason you're not eating it\" but his tone was far more demeaning than inquisitive or concerned. I'm not saying this under the filter that we were upset. That is how he sounded. He made my son very uncomfortable (as if this was all his fault which is likely how the waitress spun it). It is at that point that I mentioned I'm friends with one of the daughter's owner (who got us a table last time I was there). He questioned the validity of my friendship or even her existence. This is not what you do. I may have been unhappy but I was not confrontational. He dug himself in deep and still did little to correct the situation. <br><br>All in all, I do think their food is excellent as it always has been. Their service, reflected by their poor management and apathetic wait staff however, I believe, is not acceptable for a restaurant that is charging $100 for a steak.

I would advise making a reservation a bit in advance if you are planning on going to Gibson's.

If you're expecting a secluded, quiet dinner with that someone special, you'll be disappointed. Tables are in close proximity and you'll probably be engaged in conversation and feel like you're sharing your meal with your neighbors. The restaurant will also be loud especially if it's on a night like we went.

For those of you that are into beef grades, the corn fed and dry aged beef for 40 days has its own USDA Prime Certification that is specific for Gibsons restaurant group only i.e. you're probably not gonna find this kind of beef, that is this good, outside of Gibsons. I savored every bite of my medium rare steak that was seasoned perfectly and needed no other enhancement. Honestly, I could have eaten another 22 ounces.<br><br>The rest of the food was superb but make sure you have plenty of appetite left if you're going to order the turtle pie, because it is ridiculous huge and not something you can take home with you.<br><br>Service was impeccable from our team.

My husband always enjoys his fish dinner with the mountain of mashed potatoes and grilled veggies but, the dill tarter sauce served with it was different from the Gibson's we went to in Oakbrook. This one tasted more commercial and not homemade. However, he still enjoyed it, regardless. My steak however, was a little disappointing. I ordered medium well but, it arrived pretty burnt and well, majority of the steak. It definitely wasn't as tender as I'd liked. No competing with My steak I'd eaten the next night at Michael Jordan's steakhouse which, was EVERYTHING and they have my French onion soup on the menu daily.

My fav is the classic New Your Strip oscar style. The smaller of the two is more than enough for most but if I'm in the mood for leftovers I'll do the larger. Sides are generous enough for two. If I had to flag one weak spot it's the salads. They're tasty but uninspired...just basic Ceasar/caprese/etc. Nothing bad but nothing special either.<br><br>So many people have written about the amazing deserts so I'll avoid repeating. Just aggregate all of the good dessert reviews and drop them in here.<br><br>What I go back for is the service. It is impeccable, particularly if you are doing a business meal. A sign of great service is how the servers \"read\" the table. At mediocre restaurants servers will simply barge into your conversation no matter what you're doing just to get their \"is everything ok?\" mandatory visit. If you're doing business or having an intimate conversation with your date this can be annoying and disruptive depending on the frequency. That doesn't happen here. Servers are around but do not interrupt if you're deep in conversation, yet drinks are refilled, plates removed, all without breaking up the conversation. They don't hurry you out the door if they see you talking and having good conversation. They do the team approach very well; if your \"main\" server is at another table your food isn't going to get cold...someone else will bring it to you as soon as it is ready. Service at the bar is also great. The bartenders are there but not there depending on your need. You don't find that just anywhere and if you do business in restaurants frequently you know how hard this is to find.  <br><br>But don't get me wrong - the servers and hosts/hostesses are extremely friendly and entertaining. They know the menu, the wine list, the preparations, and they're fun! The server we had on our most recent visit said he'd been there for 22 years and \"came with the building\". <br><br>Make reservations and go early if you can.

That one had to be taken out because there was no room left to enjoy it! As wonderful as the food was, my favorite part was getting to see Moe our favorite server once again.

I think the ambiance can really add to one's dining experience and sadly Gibson's didn't cut it for me. Where is the diversity among the patrons? The customers all looked the same. While I understand Gibsons is a fixture in Gold Coast, I was absolutely shocked by the lack of diversity, including the wait staff. One might ask, is it Gibsons fault for the kind of clientele they attract? Maybe...maybe not, but if you're looking to take your out of town work colleagues to this place, like I did, I actually felt embarassed because the restaurant didn't portray a healthy representation of Chicagoans, but perhaps it did.<br><br>I devoured the Chilean sea bass.

Thankfully, it was handled flawlessly, but the execution however was not (I will get to that at the end.) The meal started with the delicious fresh raisin bread on the table. TIP: allow the butter they give you to thaw. They present it completely frozen and it is a pain to spread, leaving you feeling embarrassed and chomping on chunks of butter.<br> <br>Our entrees: For a table of 4, we ordered 3 large steaks to share, a side of mushrooms and a side of brussels sprouts. With each meal comes a choice of a soup or a salad. 3 of us ordered the gumbo, while one individual ordered a salad. Within a few minutes, 4 gumbos come out. When we reminded the waiter of the salad, he carried on and eventually brought out the correct order. The 4th soup however sat in the middle of the table, sad and catching a cold. (RIP to the delicious, wasted and uneaten gumbo) The gumbo was delicious! It had a light and smoky flavoring with chunks of sausage and vegetables. I wish there was a few more seafood pieces in the soup, but either way I was very satisfied. After the soups/ salad, our steaks came out. The restaurant nicely sliced the steaks to make it easier for all of us to share (which I greatly appreciated) however, the sides were mess up #2 & #3. We were presented with mashed potatoes, fries and brussels sprouts. When the server (who was not our waiter) was alerted, he apologized and the mushrooms were quickly brought out and corrected. A few minutes later, another round of fries tried to join our party, but we reminded the staff that we did not invite them to attend our festivities. The brussels sprouts were absolutely delicious and should be a must order for all parties going forward. They were grilled to perfection and the bacon glaze left my tongue crying from pure joy. I even considered throwing a few elbows to steal everyone else's portions. Nevertheless, I was a lady and kept to my portioned amount, and let others enjoy them as well. The mushrooms however tasted as if they were marinated in butter and completely drowned out any piece of mushroom taste they may have tried to survive. If my eyes were closed, I could have guessed anything but mushrooms were in my mouth. While not my personal favorite, the other table members felt they weren't the worst but definitely not worth ever ordering again. As for the meat, it also had mixed reviews overall. I personally felt the meat was extremely salty and wasn't able to enjoy it past 2 slices. The others felt the saltiness was a bit more bearable, but ultimately not as enjoyable as we would have imagined.<br> <br>While we were enjoying our entrees, we attempted 3 times to order cocktails. After eventually waving down our waiter (imagine one of those auto dealer waving blow up dolls), we were able to place our drink order. As we finished our meal, the waiter began to ask about dessert. In sheer panic that they would order another dessert and forget the 2 I had purchased earlier, I excused myself and ran to alert the hostess. She quickly notified the staff and corrected the birthday desserts. While I appreciated the hostess correcting the issue, the dessert in my opinion should have come out on its own. The family I was with, was in the process of ordering a desert, and for anyone who has dined at Gibson's, one desert is enough to feed the entire Blackhawks team. So 3 total potential desserts for a party of 4 would have been completely unnecessary and wasteful. For desserts, we had the carrot cake and the banana cream pie. The banana cream pie looks like a lunch lady slapped a blob of mush on a plate, but in reality, this blob of mush tastes like the ultimate sweet and creamy banana goodness. The carrot cake is 37 stories of goodness as well. The cake is soft & perfectly paired with the rich cream cheese frosting. We had boxes of leftover dessert that I couldn't wait to dig in to later on that night. <br><br>The bill: Once our our dessert plates had been licked clean, & the last sips of wine had been sipped, the bill was presented. To no one's shock, error #5 came when the bill include 2 sides we never ordered. Rather that alerting the staff, we decided we would rather pay the extra $12 & get out. <br><br>While we left overall content, it was a huge disappointment that such a prime restaurant to the Chicago area had both so many mistakes & unsatisfactory food quality, especially when we were coming in to celebrate a big birthday.  I am a regular at Hugo's & could not rave about them more, so this review for Gibson's  comes with a heavy heart", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XTille1u3_tlKCQ-XSevFw/348s.jpg", "caption": "The delicious carrot cake and the banana cream pie"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "My husband and I planned a quick weekend trip to Chicago and a friend of ours said to make sure we went to Gibsons's.

The prices are high, but any quality restaurant should be, and we expected this.  I am always willing to pay for excellent service and wonderful food.  The prices are reflective of the service you will receive at Gibson's and totally worth every penny.<br><br>Stephani Smiles for Gibson's Bar and Steakhouse ;)<br>#bestlobsterbisqueever", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yafD6-brm_UTTR2vb3M6Ug/348s.jpg", "caption": "at the bar awaiting our table"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "My husband brought me here for a date-night.  WOW!  We had Richard as our server and he was phenomenal!  He was very attentive to not only us, but the other tables around us.

I'll go talk to the outside hostess.\"  He then walked away.  <br><br>Thank goodness Gibson's has one professional employee, a women named Kathy (short blond hair) saw what happened and arranged a table for us next door at their sister restaurant Hugo's.  <br><br>I waited tables in high school and throughout college, and I understand the wait can be long when the weather does not cooperate. We did not have a reservation and knew we might have to wait.  My problem is with the attitude of the hostesses and (surprisingly) the male manager. Being from Hawaii, a state with a hospitality driven economy, I know that a good manager's job is to diffuse a situation and make it right with the customer.  Not to snipe at them.  Highly unprofessional.  If Kathy isn't a manager, she should be and the manager we had to deal with should come to Hawaii for a lesson in Aloha.<br><br>And BTW, the patio hostess needs to learn when not to over serve patrons.  There was a table near the patio hostess station where three males were highly intoxicated.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Pretty interesting spot.

I think Mad Men was on TV and my dumb @$$ wanted to act like Mr. Big Shot and ordered an old fashioned. To hell with that God awful drink! Breakfast that morning was a cup of coffee and lunch was a banana and a granola bar (long story). The point is, my stomach was on empty and after a few mixed drinks and a Hacker-Pschorr Hefe Weisse Naturtrüb beer (you like that?) I was... TOASTED.<br><br>I went here almost on a dare. The GIBSONS logo is featured prominently on a TV show called The League. I also researched beforehand which steak I was going to get. Check out this marketing plug:  \"We are the only restaurant group in the country to have its own USDA Certification (USDA Gibsons Prime Angus beef). Our beef is breed specific, Black Angus, and raised on sustainable farms in the Upper Midwest. Our beef is corn fed for 120 days and aged for 40 days, providing maximum flavor and tenderness.\" Blah blah blah...<br><br>So there I am - Mr. Borracho ready to sink my teeth into a $50 steak ($51.75 for those keeping score.)

This cave man wants 22 ounces of meat! That bad mother came out piping ass hot!  I've never in my life had a hot steak. Usually it's warm almost room temperature but this mother was HOT.  I tore into that thing up like Mike Tyson in the 80's.<br><br>All I remember is that it was good, damn good, like WHOA MAN good. So good, it was able to penetrate my mental fog and snap me back to reality. I remember a great charred taste and a very robust flavor throughout the cut.

This steak is awesome. Get it.<br><br>-Gibsons Open-Faced Steak Sandwich: my cousin got this, which was topped w/ the ribeye, grilled tomato, baby arugula, and horseradish cream. It was basically the steak we got, but chopped up onto a sandwich. Perfect for those who still want to try the W.R's Chicago Cut, but want something light.<br><br>We paired our steak w/ a nice bottle of Dona Paula Malbec from Argentina. For sides, we got the Double Baked Potato and Creamed Spinach, which were solid.

See pictures for more) slice of ice cream cake w/ a graham cracker crust (I think?), chocolate and caramel sauce, and tons of macadamia nuts. Already stuffed from our lunch, we questioned whether or not we should order this, but after hearing what it consisted of, we said screw it and ordered it...and then demolished it.

I ordered my steak medium well - ensuring that means a pink, but not bloody center. When I attempted to cut into my steak, it had a beef jerky consistency. Thinking it was maybe just the ends, but upon cutting into the middle, it was the same. I could barely get the meat chewed. For the first time in my life, i decided to send something back to the kitchen! I figured if I am paying $70 for a steak, i should be able to eat it. They apologized and said they would bring me a new one. My second steak appeared along with the restaurant manager as he wanted to make sure this one was cooked correctly. He asked me to cut into it. The outside was burned and it was literally raw in the center. He apologized and took it away, offering me a third.

We got it peppercrusted, which had a little too much kick for me, but was still very good. The sides are huge and enough to split so we split 3 for 4 people. We ordered the asparagus, brussel sprouts and blue cheese potatoes. I am a new brussel sprout fan, but the maple and bacon combo sounded too good to pass up and I was right! The asparagus was also great with the hollandaise sauce and this disappeared fast at our table. Now, I am not a blue cheese fan at all, but I tried the potatoes and loved them!! There was no blue cheese taste to them. We then got a sorbet and vanilla ice cream to split for dessert. It's safe to say we left the restaurant stuffed!!

I will be turning 40 this week and I wanted to do something really special. I had never tasted a very high end steak before, so I thought I would try it. The waiter comes out with steaks on a tray and explains each one to you to help you decide. My waiter was nice but he spoke really, really fast. It was too hard to follow what he was saying so I just went with the \"Chicago Cut\" Ribeye and a double baked potato. The bread basket was pretty good. The side salad was ok but no tomatoes, croutons, or anything \"fun\" on it. The double baked potato was enough for four hungry people. It was okay but not nearly as good as the description made it sound. The waiter actually took it off my bill when he saw I only ate part of it. <br>That was unnecessary but nice of him. <br><br>The steak was somewhere between \"okay\" and \"good,\" but I have actually had better mail order steaks on a friend's outdoor grill. I asked for mine Medium Well, but it actually looked more Medium (or even possibly Medium Rare) to me. I casually mentioned this to a waitress who had struck up a conversation with me about my meal, and she started to kind of argue with me. She retorted something like, \"That's why the waiter describes it before your order is taken.\" Well yes, the waiter DID describe a Medium Well steak to me, as far as I could tell. He was speaking so fast that again, it was hard to follow. But the description sounded basically like Medium Well from what I could catch. Doesn't mean that's what I got. Then again, I am from Fort Wayne and they overcook everything here, so maybe my perception is skewed. Probably is.<br><br>One funny quirk I have noticed about this place is that the servers keep asking you how you are, but it's like as soon as you start to answer, they look away and move as far away from you as quickly as they can.

Too bad I hate pumpkin pie.

Griswold. He's an ideal American, a patriot. He represents Chicago and the midwest with all of the big, brash American bad-assery that makes this country great. He's also tempered by an imperfect (to say the least) family and a tendency to overshoot his expectations. <br><br>For Clark, expectations are larger than life. Wallyworld offers too much fun. Christmas is about towering trees and enough lights to turn night to day. Europe is filled with adventure and exotic women. Unfortunately for Clark, like me, reality often doesn't meet expectations.<br><br>Which brings us to steak. <br><br>At some point in Chicago's history, the city became known for its steaks. America has two other steak cities -- New York and Kansas City. Arguably, New York is an 'everything' city, but we'll stay with the Midwest. Kansas City's definitive prime steakhouse is Plaza III, a traditional, reliable, charming Midwestern steakhouse that offers just about everything that one would expect: nicely charred prime beef and a basic suite of traditional sides (creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, etc). Over 50 years, Plaza III has built a national reputation on behalf of Kansas City, and rightfully so.  <br><br>Then there's Chicago, a city where the representative steakhouse is much more ambiguous. Chicago offers everything from frighteningly modern steakhouses to equally frightening older ones. There's a large margin for error in identifying the perfect candidate.  <br><br>In my Chicago steakhouse search, I channeled my inner Clark W. Griswold. I wanted the best. I wanted something larger than life, something so dramatic and uniquely Chicago that it would change my perception of the American steakhouse. And in a rare instance where my and Clark's lives diverged, the reality of Gibson's managed to exceeded expectation.<br><br>Warm woods, classic framed photographs and a cozy little gift shop greet you at the door, as do several suited-up managers. The dazzling bar room, draped with classic art deco touches and a nod to modern aviation (via a collection of meticulous model airplanes), sees a recurring cast of both usual suspects and wide-eyed out-of-towners like myself. The dining room, too, uses a tested combination of dim candlelight, mahogany and creamy linens to set the stage for a romantic evening.  <br><br>Then there's the food. Gibson's is the only steakhouse in the country with its own USDA Certification. All of their steaks are Black Angus and raised on Midwestern farms. Gibson's dry-ages the steaks for 40 days and chars them in an 1800 degree broiler before serving, giving them a smokey, milky, funky, buttery quality that can only result from a good decay and a quick, high-degree char. <br><br>In terms of apps and sides, I recommend the shrimp cocktail appetizer (amazingly fresh shrimp the size of my fist, shaved horseradish, classic cocktail sauce), the mashed potatoes with roasted/sauteed garlic, and the plump, fragrant steamed asparagus with mild, fresh Hollandaise sauce. <br><br>Between the mesmerizing steaks, the array of wonderful side dishes, the classic decor and the warm embrace of several Plymouth Gin martinis, Gibson's has earned its place in my memory as the best steakhouse that Chicago has to offer. It has also become as quintessential to the Midwest for me as Clark W. Griswold, who I'm sure would love it.

The dinner salad was unremarkable. For the main course, I got W.R.'s Chicago Cut steak. Big freakin' piece of meat. Pretty good. For sides, I got mushrooms and Bourbon Brussel sprouts with bacon. The mushrooms were bland but firm, and the Brussel sprouts were too hard, bland, but slightly cloyingly sweet. Relatively mediocre. No dessert, we were too full.

My boyfriend and I arrived early to grab a cocktail prior to our 8:30pm reservation.  I highly recommend sipping on an Old Fashioned and listening to the pianist in the bar area prior to dining. We were escorted to what I felt was the best seat in the house, but it appeared as if you couldn't have a bad seat with how the restaurant is laid out. Since our reservation was like maybe 2 minutes pass (literally 8:32pm) Scott (1 of three very visual managers) had an appetizer on the way for my main squeeze and I. The Avocado Crab Meat appetizer set the perfect tone for the meal. I had been anticipating a huge steak, so it was nice to have a seafood dish prior. It was a really nice touch with Scott's style of management, fully engaged and elevating the experience as a consumer. Our server, Michael (I believe, so mad I can't say it with 100% certainty) was professional, charming, and set us up for success. For the table the Chicago Cut, Porterhouse, sautéed spinach, mushrooms, and mashed potatoes were ordered...and made sure to hold a strawberry shortcake for dessert. The charred outside of the steak with the perfect medium-rare temp on the inside was to die for. Splitting sides was the way to go. Huge portions. The shortcake could serve 8, but we ate for 6. So flipping good. What a seasonal treat. Other than my mama's Thanksgiving dinner, the best meal I've ever had. I can honestly say I'll think about the Chicago Cut and strawberry shortcake everyday for the rest of my days.

Rush Street is known for it's nightlife, which features five star restaurants and entertainment. I have been coming to Gibsons  since they opened around 25 years ago. The food and service have always been consistently superb, five star, but are a little pricey. <br>When going to Gibsons it is best if you make reservations, or you may be disappointed by not being able to get in.  Even with reservation,  at the busiest times there is a good chance that you will be asked to wait in the bar. We had reservations over Thanksgiving weekend and had to wait  in the bar area, which  was not the most pleasant experience, because the bar was very crowded with a large number of people who were compacted together leaving guests no personal space at all. Along with the people waiting for their reservation, there were people trying to eat in the bar, along with the regulars who go to be seen.<br>The dining room is very large, in addition there is outdoor seating in the summer and a private room on the second floor. When we were seated, our waiter Mike came and asked us for our drink orders, returning quickly he brought with him a large tray showing and explaining the different cuts and sizes of steaks and a gigantic lobster tail. Even though Gibsons is known as a steakhouse they do offer many fish and seafood dishes which are outstanding. All entrées come with a house salad or soup. My son ordered the WR's Chicago Cut 22oz., double baked potato and cream spinach. The portions are so large that you can share the sides. When the steak arrived it was beautifully charred, served at the correct temperature, very tasty,  and extremely tender. I ordered salmon which was on the menu , I asked if they could prepare it a different way? Mike was wonderful, asking me how I wanted the salmon prepared? I asked if the chef could have the salmon in lemon butter sauce with capers, it was delicious!  In addition the potato and creamed spinach added to our meals. Unfortunately we had no room for desert because they are gigantic like everything else. The meal was wonderful and Mike is a superb waiter.<br> After dinner the bar area had cleared out some and we were able to listen to Lloyd Wilson, who gave a fantastic jazz performance on the piano. Lloyd Wilson performs Wednesdays through Saturdays, 9 pm - 1 am. I would recommend coming to Gibsons just to hear Lloyd Wilson perform, his wonderful music, which really adds a lot to Gibsons.<br>Considering the short wait earlier in the evening to be seated ,   I am giving Gibsons 4.5 stars but will bump up the rating to five stars, because of Mike's fantastic service, and Lloyd Wilson's wonderful performance.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/v4coee74g1j5GiN9Nlu3mw/348s.jpg", "caption": "Giant lobster, filet, N.Y.

All I got was a bitter aftertaste. <br><br>Still gotta give it up for Gibson's. The service is always great, and as long as you order the right thing, you probably won't be let down with your food. In my observation, those things are:<br>1. The French Dip (less expensive and far far tastier than the aforementioned royalty of handheld meals)<br>2. The Prime Rib (presentation is potentially terrifying as it looks like they had to kill multiple cows to produce a piece of meat this large, definitely puts the laughter in slaughter)<br>3. The New England Clam Chowder (the secret ingredient is Tom Brady's tears)<br>4. The Wedge Salad (so retro, antiquated slang like \"groovy\" and \"daddy-o\" enter my vernacular while consuming)<br><br>Anyways, I'm sure I could come up with more to say, but you're probably done reading and there's a very special episode of Aarti Party on in like 5 minutes, so I'm gonna boogie.

I refuse to put steak sauce on a filet cooked medium. I told Michael the issue and he agreed. He was a great sport throughout our ordeal.

This place is a raucous and noisy restaurant, jam packed with tables and people. There isn't much room between tables, and you pretty much have to yell across for your table mates to hear you. But if you really came here to have a great steak - you won't be disappointed. Portions are very large, and they know how to cook steaks - red or pink in the middle, you'll get it right. Service is friendly but basic ... with many tables and a busy house, service is often inattentive. They forgot to offer us another round of drinks, probably in their hurry to turn the tables. While this is not a Four-Star dining experience, it is a famous watering hole in Chicago and many people have it on their must see list for entertaining out-of-town guests ... as such it is always busy, so reservations are recommended.<br><br>This is not a place for kids or even teenagers ... strictly an adult steak joint. It also is not a stop for a quiet, romantic dinner. If you are on your way to a Blackhawks hockey game at the United Center or simply walking over from the Drake Hotel on Michigan Avenue for a change of pace, this is a great place to stop for a big steak and a strong drink before the puck drops or the night sets in.

Everyone was impressed with his professionalism, sense of humor and ability to juggle not only our large table, but many others just like it with ease. Being that the majority of the people in our group are in the restaurant industry this is no small compliment. The appetizers were phenomenal, especially the crabmeat avocado, which had even people who are not shellfish fans asking for second portions. To the surprise of no one the steaks lived up to their reputation of being cooked to perfection. The filet had a peppercorn crust that was thick, spicy and charred on the outside while still juicy and rare on the inside. Bearnaise was served on the side but the meat was so good that it sadly went uneaten. The double baked potato was an enormous portion of cheesy deliciousness.

Also it could be quite loud so if you are looking for a quiet and romantic dinner, this is not the place for you. <br><br>Food--we ordered some appetizer, BUT I don't remember what exactly we had. All I could remember is how BIG my bf's steak was. I think he ordered the smaller of the two porterhouse cuts, yet it's still probably the largest cut I've seen. And my bf said it was very tender and yummy. I had the fillet, medium well (I don't like seeing pink in my food unless it's waygu), it was pretty yummy but I'm not the steak expert to say whether it's the best. We also had asparagus as side, very fresh and enough to share for two. <br><br>Dessert--Okay here's the key, their dessert is HUGE! I mean HUGE!

The rest of the meal was just eh- i'm guessing that the fact we just walked in at 9:30 on a Wednesday night had something to do with it. The salad was actually kind of inedible, the double baked potato (usually so good) wasn't anything special, and the side of broccoli was just broccoli (I expect more from Gibsons).  And....when it came time for dessert they didn't have my favorite banana cake. My, oh my....what has happened to Gibsons?<br><br>Tonight's experience at Gibsons was 3 stars (if even that), but because they share a kitchen with my beloved Hugo's and it's not really fair for me to judge a steakhouse when I'm not a steak lover I'll be generous with 4 stars.
