The pot pies are nice and for appetizer I would definitely recommend the Mediterranean bread. I personally like the bread more than the pot pie. <br><br>There is always a line, so be prepared to wait for a while. One time we went here on Friday at 4:15 (they open at 4) and there was still a 45 minute wait for 2 people. You can have a seat at the bar and grab something to drink while waiting for your table. Around the time our table was ready I heard the man at the door tell someone the wait was 1.5 hours for two people. Also, both bar and restaurant are cash only. There is an ATM by the door so if you don't have cash on you it's not a problem. <br><br>Overall, I think the experience, great and professional service, and the food warrant a 4 star. I just personally don't like the pizza style, and every time I've been here is because of my girlfriend or other friends who wanted to try the pot pies.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vdpzXe9IPXgHHiHZHWGjEw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Mediterranean Bread (make sure you add the Italian seasoning that's on your table)"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/micYyPRuD1TIU00tdHjE1w/168s.jpg", "caption": "Pizza Pot Pie"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "How come I've lived in Chicago for 5 years and never been here! It's a shame on my part. <br>This pizza place is sooo cute, it screams family owned restaurant and the neighborhood gem. It's tiny, so you'll have to make a reservation or wait quite a while. My friends and I went on a random Monday night and waited for about 45 mins! <br>I would recommend going for the pizza pot pie! It's pizza crust in a bowl shape and filled with pizza sauce, sausage, onions, & cheese. The 1/2 pounder is an individual portion and costs $13.75. We were a bit greedy so we ordered the Mediterrean bread as well, which is just a super thin, flat piece of round bread that is sprinkled with a generous amount of seasoning and parmesan cheese. All the carbs will fill your belly up, guaranteed. <br>I want to come back and try the oven grinders, which look like big Italian loaves or sandwiches...ahhh I'm drooling! Highly recommending this place, especially for you tourists who are looking for a Chicago pizza experience.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Finally after two years of having this on my Chicago to-eat list, I've finally found an excuse to come visit and try this pizza pot pie with my friends from home. Students and friends alike have mentioned that it's worth the wait to try this style of pizza. So what was the verdict?<br><br>...Not bad Oven Grinder Co! Your pot pie was certainly a new experience.<br><br>The physically large menu should be telling of what you're about to get yourself into. My friends and I did a bit of research and heed the suggestions from our server Brian- we each got a 1/5 pound pizza pie with mushrooms and sausage (the default) and split the incredibly buttery, white Mediterranean Bread. He put it best, \"it's already carby so why not just get the white bread version when wheat won't make you feel any better.\" Good points my friend.<br><br>The Mediterranean Bread reminded me of classic naan. You tear a bit with your fingers and enjoy its spices and cheesy nature. Save some for your pizza because we turned ours into pseudo-curry. Speaking of the pizza, these come out in bowls which get turned on its head and served onto your plate. It was piping hot and cool to see them break open the pizza for you in front of your eyes. Amazing!<br><br>Our pizza pot pies were what we all expected. Piping hot, rich in tomato sauce and cheese, but lacked a bit in terms of protein and the mushrooms. We ate it almost as if it was a bread bowl. The 1/2 pound is certainly meant for one person and even splitting it with another means you'll probably leave a bit hungry. With 99% of the people coming here ordering these pies, you should too.<br><br>It's certainly not my favorite kind of pizza so I don't see myself coming back here anytime soon. However, the excellent service, presentation, and style of the pizza certainly warrants it a try at least once. Glad I can finally cross this off the bucket list.<br><br>Also, CASH ONLY! Prices here are a bit steep in my opinion and you won't leave with leftovers like other Chicago pizza joints. Be prepared.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Please believe the hype!

We had nothing to do for a few hours, plus this seemed like a shorter wait than we ever expected to have here, so we said, \"why the hell not?!\" We put our name on the list, grabbed some cash from the ATM, and sat on the steps of the apartment building next door. I'm sure those neighbors just love having people wait outside their building every night, but that's some of the charm of the spot.<br><br>After waiting for about 40 minutes, the host came out to bring my boyfriend and I to a small booth inside. We were surprised at how simple the menu was: a few appetizers, two options for pot pies, a few different options for The Grinder-style pizza, and then salad meal options. You've got to be a really badass spot to be able to have such to-the-point options that are also iconic.<br><br>We ordered a large salad to start, and our waiter let us know that people often assume the large is for two, so if we wanted to get a small, that might be more fitting. We went with the large anyway, and it was delicious, but we should've listened to our waiter, because it was HUGE. I was a little worried I was going to get too full before my pot pie came, but luckily I gave up and my boyfriend finished the salad.<br><br>Then came time for the real royalty of the experience, THE POT PIE. I love you so damn much, CPOG Pot Pie. You're perfect, from the crust to the sausage and cooked mushrooms and the cheesiness. The pot pie absolutely lives up to the hype, and if you're wondering whether or not to wait and give it a try, the answer is that it's worth the wait.

As soon as I seen it I knew that I had to try it for myself. Also it helped that it was in my favorite city as well. So I deiced that upon my next annual trip I would have to go and try it out. First thing that I will say is that this place is as good as advertised. There is zero over hype. This place instantly became one of my go-to Chicago restaurants for years. Every time I come here I've came to this place since. In fact more times than any other place in Chicago<br><br>The Pizza Pot Pie is the All-Star, Lead Singer, and captain of this menu. If you come here, this is what you should be planning on getting no matter what. As soon as they bring it out to the table you will have to physically hold your jaw shut to keep your tongue from rolling out. It's a wonderful smell and it looks amazing. Especially when they flip it out the bowl and you see all that gooey melt-y cheese just flowing around inside that thing. And it taste wonderful. When I first seen the video of this place I thought that it would be good, but didn't think it would be this good. It has its own flavor and taste. It blends and balances both elements of a pizza and pot pie together so well. Believe me. You won't be disappointed with this. Other thing I always get is the Mediterranean bread. This is one of their top selling items as well. It is a must get when you go. The spices on top of it are really great. I couldn't get enough of this. <br><br>The place is really dark and dim. Which adds to vibe there. I normally prefer a lot of natural lighting. But I think the darker lighting adds to the ambiance of place, and helps the place seem more old and historic. Also this restaurant is very small. So be prepared to wait quite a bit of time to get a seat if you come any other time then when it just opens. In fact id probably say that between all the times I've been here the wait has been about 2 hours. Again except for when I got there right when they opened. <br><br>The service was really quick and nice. I have nothing bad to say about any waiter that I have had there. Everything was really quick. Waiter made lots of tips back to the table to make sure we had everything we needed. Drinks were refilled before they were even 75 percent gone. I couldn't of asked for anything more. <br><br>Overall this is one of my favorite places in Chicago. A must go to place whenever I visit. I think that anyone would love it. Good for dates, or just going to dinner with friends or family. So I highly recommend. They get a solid 5 stars in my book.

There's no way that can go wrong. So when our BFFs, who were moving from Chicago to Tennessee, asked if we'd be interested in trying this place before they left for good, we didn't hesitate. We WERE taken aback to arrive at 8pm on a Tuesday night to find a 1 hr, 40 minute wait for a table of 5.

We had requested a table because the space was tiiiiight and we thought a booth might be too snug, and every time he had a booth that would fit us, he came and checked to make sure we still wanted to wait. After an hour, he came and got us for real. I was so excited I could barely stand it! Luckily, our server wasn't playing games and came and took our order for drinks + Mediterranean bread at the same time. I felt like I was going to be underwhelmed with what appeared to be a heavily seasoned, squishy tortilla, but boy was I wrong. It was DELICIOUS, and so fun to pull apart in a giant group. But let's be real, we were here for one thing: a giant dough bowl full of pizza. So we pressed on.<br><br>When he flipped my pizza over out of its bowl, I almost gasped. It was SO cheesy and ridiculously looking, I couldn't believe it. And the taste? I mean, it's not revolutionary. It's just really, REALLY freaking delicious. The portion is huge. It's hot. It's meaty. It's melty. It's tomato-y. It's everything you want in a pizza in a fun, delicious new format. The dough is chewy and irresistible. It's everything.<br><br>For five people to have dinner and an appetizer with all non-alcoholic drinks was $105. You can't even beat it. I wish I could go back tomorrow, but that prohibitively aggressive wait makes this a special occasion kind of joint - emphasis on special.

NO EXCEPTIONS! <br><br>They do have an ATM in the hallway upon entering, FYI. <br><br>I was greeted when I walked in, I was quickly seated. Not too long after being seated, I would assume he was the bus boy, he brought over water. He was wonderful, whenever something needed cleaned he would clean it. If my water got low he refilled it quickly. He did such a good job throughout my entire visit, I was so pleased by his service, not only was he professional but he was also really sweet! <br><br>Not too long after being seated my waiter came over. He was very friendly. He answered all my questions and made sure I was good throughout my entire visit. <br><br>He was never gone for too long, he was great. Very friendly and attentive. <br><br>I ordered the famous Pizza Pot Pie, with vegetable sauce. It took my pizza about 25-30 mins to come out after I ordered it... I'm pretty happy it wasn't an hour because for some reason that's what I was expecting after reading the reviews, but it didn't take that long. <br><br>I also order an appetizer because I hadn't eaten all day so I needed something to hold me down while my \"POT PIE\" was cooking. <br><br>My appetizer arrived about 5-7 mins after I ordered it. I stared at it for a good 5 mins, I kid you not! No im kidding! :D You'll understand what I mean when you see the photo of it! <br><br>But seriously my appetizer was called \"MEDITERRANEAN BREAD\".  It did its job of keeping me satisfied until my main dish arrived. <br><br>I stopped eating my bread after a while because I didn't want to get full on bread. The bread was ok, I feel like it should be paired with something, like a cheese or something, but as I said it was ok. Not bad, it's huge by the way. It's meant to feed more than one person so of course, I took alot of it home with me.  <br><br>When my pizza pot pie finally arrived, it looked just as I expected it to. It's such a cool,innovative dish. Very appealing to the eye. <br><br>I opted to add mushrooms to my pizza, once I got my pizza I regretted that decision. Mostly because they weren't the mushrooms you usually see on pizza. They were full size mushrooms. After a while I felt as if they were in the way. <br><br>As I bit into the pizza, I was pretty pleased with the cheese topping. That was the best part to me. The other parts of the pot pie was just ok to me. I was expecting something different with the crust but it was fine in combination with the sauce and cheese. I wish the pizza had more cheese, it seemed as if my cheese disappeared pretty quickly and I was only left with sauce, crust and mushrooms. <br><br>Overall I defintely recommend this place. Defintely, Defintely! The service is amazing and it's in a great neighborhood, where you could possibly score a free parking space, if your lucky!<br><br>Defintely try this place out, at least once.

AND it's cash only. Double whammy right off the bat. Like many, I saw the Food Network segment on social media featuring Marc Murphy raving about the pizza pot pie and had to come check it out. Yes, there will be a wait - even at 9pm on a Thursday evening. The restaurant itself is quite small and tight and has a dark, tavern feel to it. The host is a very friendly guy that doesn't take your name down, he just remembers your face and how many people you have in your party. <br><br>The small chef's salad is enough to feed two. The salad was actually quite nice but let's be real, how hard is it to screw up a salad? As long as your vegetables are fresh and your dressing is up to par - you're good to go. I really enjoyed all three of the dressings that it came with. The sour cream garlic and sweet & sour poppyseed mixed together quite nicely to create a flavor-packed salad. The Italian dressing was also decent but did not mix well with the others. The salad is big enough to where you can play around with the dressings.<br><br>The Mediterranean bread is a simple yet tasty creation. The flat bread itself is so big that it dangles over the plate and onto your dining table. Let's just hope they do a good job of cleaning their tables here. When it says \"serves 2-4\" it really means \"serves 4\". The only way it serves 2 is if you plan to eat ONLY this with a salad. It's a fun dish because you tear it and eat it with your hands. The flavors are delicious and I rather enjoy dipping it in their sour cream garlic dressing that came with the salad. <br><br>The half pounder pizza pot pie was underwhelming. My favorite part was the cheese. Yummy, melted gooeyness. The rest of the pot pie was just so-so. It's basically a bowl of spaghetti meat sauce, whole button mushrooms, and Wisconsin cheese all wrapped/covered with Sicilian dough. The tomato meat sauce wasn't as flavorful as I thought it should be and the dough was just alright. Presentation is cool and is probably the main reason why people come to CPOG.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kPC6Wqkh70A7e0wXt0z9DA/348s.jpg", "caption": "exterior"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1_rC5KWc8PID4QA3rnOM9w/168s.jpg", "caption": "1/2 pound pizza pot pie"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/01_aliZSi5Y-lcl3iFMH2A/168s.jpg", "caption": "Mediterranean Bread"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Visited @8pm on a Thursday and the line was out the door - we were told the wait would be ~2hrs so we decided to get takeout.

I preface this review with that I am new to Chicago, and my dad is from a small country town. However, where I am from or how my family looks should probably not affect my level of service. I also preface this with that my dad is a very humble and kind man (as he raised us all to be), and always tips well and treats waiters/waitresses even better. <br><br>I recently moved to the area and my dad was a bit apprehensive about the move. I had been looking into ways to comfort him for weeks, and he's a huge foodie, so finding this place on Insider and getting him excited to come here provided great solace for me because I wanted to comfort him and give him things to look forward to in the midst of his daughter leaving the nest, so to speak. My dad was raving about this place and took a large group (6-7 of us) here one night- my siblings and him. <br><br>Now, my dad isn't a rich man but he definitely splurged on this meal. He splurges when it comes to great food and great service. Even if the service isn't great, that's just his nature. We were told there was a two hour wait so because of just how excited he was about this place, we wandered around the area for two hours before being seated. When we got inside, we were a bit overwhelmed by how jam packed it was, when the waiter had to leave us in the middle of the order and then come back a few minutes later because the aisles are so crowded two cannot really simultaneously occupy it. I got really claustrophobic, but again, it was about my dad and his great night, not me. <br><br>The waiter came by and took all our orders- very kind initially. We ordered for ourselves as well as 2 take-homes for my roommate and my mom who was at my place unpacking things and they told us it would be another 20-45 minutes, which we agreed to. Still pleasant as ever. We made great conversation over the salad we ordered for an appetizer- which had great dressing but was overall an average, somewhat over-priced salad. <br><br>When the waiter came with our bill, my dad put down his debit card and the waiter frowned and told him it was cash only. Now, granted there is a sign at the front of the building. I understand this. However, due to lines and wait time we only saw it after we were called in for our reservation and quickly rushed by it. Still our faults? Yes. Okay to be rude to us for being unaware patrons who were only trying to remedy the problem? Absolutely not. The waiter immediately got VERY rude with my dad, exclaiming \"there are signs EVERYWHERE\" and making him feel patronized, condescended to, and less than. Maybe because he had a humble, slightly dirty from the day's move, cotton t-shirt on? I don't know. My dad rarely gets embarrassed but as he continued to berate my dad's obliviousness, my dad began to look distraught and ashamed, which really really was not okay with me.<br><br>I got up and went to the ATM after I got the waiter to stop disrespecting my father in front of me and went to withdraw the $200 needed to cover the meal as well as the tip I was raised to STILL leave. The ATM was not working, causing me to have to go back into the entrance to the kitchen (embarrassing scene honestly) and ask for the manager's help. At this point, a good 3.5 hours of our last night invested in this nightmarish experience in total. Finally, with a different card,I was able to withdraw the funds. The waiter took it snarkily and made another passing comment that was seriously just unnecessary. <br><br>When we went to leave, my dad was actually pretty upset. I have never in my life seen him not want to leave a large tip, but he wanted to leave $10 for a large bill because of how blatantly and publicly embarrassed and disrespected he felt. It wasn't about the cash-only policy, it was about the dehumanizing way he was treated for making a simple mistake of not knowing in this foreign city that that was a thing here. And he fixed it too. So I don't know why he had to be treated this way, especially when we gave them a pretty penny of business. I used my own cash to leave a larger tip because everyone deserves the benefit of the doubt. No apology from the waiter nor manager. No words of kindness. Just one last \"it's literally posted in the entrance\" as we walked out. The most will-power induced tip of kindness I ever left for someone who did not deserve it. The pizza was mediocre, special as it is flipped upside down and the presentation draws a crowd, but the sour taste in my mouth from my dad having to experience this on literally my last night with him was way too much for me. This place leaves a terrible taste in my mouth and I am to this day incredibly hurt by it. I wish we had gone absolutely anywhere else.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Great food!

Well Ok, if you don't...GOOGLE IT ;) <br>In 1972 a Chicago attorney bought the property and on the ground floor started the Chicago Pizza Grinder Co. He called it  \"Chicago's most exciting restaurant concept in many years\"... <br>The best dish to try here is the pizza pot pie. This dish blew my mind. The presentation is hilarious, mozzarella cheese in the bottom of the pot, mushrooms, authentic Italian meat sauce, covered with the dough on top. All this ingredients cooked in a wood oven and served in a plate by flipping it over in front of you.<br>Words can't describe how the dough melts in your mouth.

(Vegetarian Pizza Pot Pie available.)<br><br>... only having seen most patrons with their pizza pot pie, I was willing to follow the other sardines.  Once the food arrived the pizza pot pie is turned upside down or is it right side up and popped out of the bowl and onto my plate.  The unveiling lasted only seconds but the presentation was enough to make me think that this server at least has done this process many times before.  This was different, this was very similar to a deep dish pizza, with a major similarity being,  that's a lot of pizza.   The taste was different though,  in a good way.   The dough wasn't doughy, the Sicilian bread-type dough had almost a cake texture, very light and fluffy, the dough however was the star of the show.  The whole mushrooms the cheese sausage everything seemed just as how it should have been.  However,  I had ordered the half pounder, the other option was a pounder, I could have eaten another half pound.  Now this probably sounds like a lot of food,  but it's not as much as it sounds.  I finished wanting more.  I guess I'll have to wait for my next visit. <br><br>I look forward to returning regardless of the wait.  The experience was a pleasant one despite the wait.   I'll wait a little while and I see you again Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder Company.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Long wait.

Thanks to the show, The Best Thing I Ever Ate, we got to try this unique pizza! <br><br>Each pizza pot pie is made with layers of Wisconsin Brick Cheese, button mushrooms and topped with a homemade tomato sauce with sausage. You can even pick whether or not you want white or wheat dough. Just in case you're a vegetarian, there's a vegetarian tomato sauce too. It take about ~30 minutes for each pizza to cook, and they will flip it for you at your table! <br><br>I highly recommend getting half-pounder per person. There's is no price difference between getting the half-pounder verses the one pounder. My husband and I were contemplating on splitting the one pounder, but our waiter actually recommended that we each get a half-pounder because splitting the one pounder would be super messy. And he was RIGHT! Btw, It's super cute to have your own pizza pot pie. <br><br>You must try their mediterranean bread and the chef's salad while you wait for your pizza. I know most of you guys will be dying for something to eat after waiting for so long to be seated. Don't be alarmed when the mediterranean bread comes out! It's huge! It's a super thin bread (almost like a thin pita bread) topped with a mixture of herbs and cheese. It's nothing like I have ever tried before, but you'll love it! I promise. It's a wonderful appetizer for the start of your meal. <br><br>The chef's salad is surprisingly simple, yet delicious! It's basically chopped lettuce with onions, cucumbers and tomatoes. What makes it amazing is the dressing. The salad comes with two dressings - a sweet/sour poppyseed and sour cream garlic. The BEST way to eat the salad is by combining both dressings together! Who would've thought these two dressings combined would be so good! <br><br>You MUST get here early! It's best to get there when the restaurant opens. I know it seems crazy to come at 4PM for dinner, but trust me, the earlier you get here, the less time you will have to wait. We came here around 5PM and only had to wait ~40-45 minutes. By the time we were seated, I overheard that it was a 1.5-2 hour wait. <br><br>NOTE: When you come in, the host will take your name down on his notepad with the number of people in your party. it's going to seem crazy, but the host will come and find you when they have a table ready for you - whether you're sitting inside or outside. I don't know how he remembers so many people, but he does and will find you. Don't question or bother him until he finds you! Unfortunately, that means you cannot leave the area and come back.

Their pizza pot pie, their most famous menu item, is definitely the key to complete your experience. I once saw this was introduced in a tv show and learned how they make their homemade sauce. Very impressive! It's not very strong in any way but it's just this fine combination of flavors with freshness. Half pound works great for me! <br><br>A tip for all new visitors - make sure you arrive the restaurant earlier before it opens because they open earlier than 4pm especially when the crowd is there. Today, all tables are full at 4pm. The food is very good so walking away with hours of wait will make you disappointed. <br><br>This place gives you this antique feeling because it's wooden interior design. I personally like it a lot because just like their good, not overly decorative but still give you nice dining experience. Our waiter was very nice. I'd say though, you might be upset if you are soda lovers because you can refill your drink for free. Also, their excellent Mediterranean bread though, is too big and touch the table. The staff was very good at cleaning the mess; however I would prefer a bigger plate.

An hour and 45 min passed so I went back in to check with the gentleman he then tells me there are 4 people ahead of me so I go back outside and wait.

They will give you one glass of water while you wait and after that you are at the mercy of the bar. I would see people be 3-4 beers/glasses of wine deep before they get to their table. They charge per glass of soda (a habit from the 70's or pure profit). Your best bet to beat the bar curse is to order a draft beer (they only come in 23oz sizes) and sip. <br><br>The food is well priced. I enjoyed the salad and mixing dressings. The poppy seed dressing reminded me of a dressing my ex stepmother used to buy (likely what she had bought since the 70's). I don't understand the bread. It wasn't that great to me rather dry, you have to use the garlic cream dressing to make it less dry. I think this might be a chicago thing to love this bread. I overheard a Chicago local say this bread was better than similar breads at other places. The pizza in unique in regards to a pizza experience/ presentation. I was hoping it would have butter dough like a pot pie has but it is like the bread dough on top. The pizza meat sauce reminded me of my father's spaghetti sauce.

I never thought I'd love such a simple salad so much, but I really did. Again, the quality of the ingredients were just amazing. The tomatoes were so firm, lettuce so crisp..just a behest salad. Best part? The dressings! Oh my God those dressings were SO good! One was a poppyseed base and the other a sour cream base - so unique and just so good! The Mediterranean bread seems simple in the sense that it's some seasoning on bread, but that seasoning? To die for. A great combo we found?

It's what tourists would call Chicago sized.  Fit to fully feed two people.   If you get a salad, don't bother ordering the bread or your own personal pot pie.   <br><br>This is my second visit to oven grinder.  Both times not too impressed.  Perhaps it's because I'm not a fan of hype built up thru waiting. And it just does not stand out to me as must have for my taste buds.   <br><br>It's a popular spot (and its been popular for years!) and worth taking your out of town guests.   (Just make sure that your guests hold the spot in line while you take your time getting there.   <br><br>Happy eating folks!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OsPSTfLbbILUhZwjp7kMPA/348s.jpg", "caption": "Mediterranean bread (must get)"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7d9xoNx1OvJyyf7DYBVpHg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Prior to the flip"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZenukA6b6Ht99e3_BYx1FQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "The first cut"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Stood in line here at 10:30 am in 0F and waited until 11:15 for them to open up and let us in.

I said, ok sure.. but ONLY if I can try the infamous pizza pot pie. Coming here was what I was looking forward to the most during my trip. I had seen the Food Network videos, and dreamt of the day when I would be presented with the pizza pot pie. We were only in Chicago for the weekend.. arriving late Friday night and leaving very early Sunday morning. I decided the best bet to try this pizza without waiting 4 hours (yes, people do that.. check out some of these other reviews) was to visit FIRST THING Saturday morning, like immediately when they opened. We rented a car in Chicago, because we were staying in Arlington Heights for the concert. Although I tried to be proactive and download a parking app (ParkWhiz-- which I do NOT recommend), I still had trouble finding parking for this place. We arrived at like 11:15 am (they open at 11:30 am). I had to drop the boyfriend off and go find parking. I imagined it wouldn't take me long. HAH. Long story short.. yes, it took me a while. They wouldn't seat my boyfriend until the other member of his party (me) arrived. After many people came in after him and it started to get busier, a sweet, sweet host pitied my boyfriend and sat him anyway (thank you kind gentleman!). When I finally arrived, it was close to noon. We ordered the Mediterranean bread to start, as so many people raved about it. Good decision- this bread was EPIC. PACKED with flavor, and huge. Next, we got the salad... WOW. The dressings were SO GOOD. The garlic sour cream and the sweet poppy seed dressings were delightful on their own, but mixed together.. heck yes. Last, but certainly not least.. the pizza pot pie. We ordered the smaller one, with no meat sauce and with mushrooms... it was just as dreamy as I imagined. The sauce was super flavorful, the dough was so tasty and the cheese was insanely good. It was so delicious. I enjoyed every single bite. We had tons of Mediterranean bread left over, but nothing else, so this was the right amount of food for two people (unless you have access to a fridge, then go for the large pizza). Not only was the food insanely good but the service was great as well. Our waters were always full and our server was helpful and kind. Side note- they will not let you take extra dressing to-go. I kinda hated that.. not because I needed the dressing, but really it's just a waste of food to throw it away.

Better yet, look for 'Riccardo Enoteca' which has a huge green sign and look directly across and you'll find this place. <br><br>3) You will need to open three doors to reach the short sorta old waitlist man (do not stand in the first room thinking he will come to you!!). It gets more and more crowded as you open each door. After you open the third door, wait for the short man to come by and make eye contact with him and tell him \"I'm new\" and he'll ask \"how many\" and you'll reply \"6\" and he'll say \"okay 1 hour and 40 minute wait, wait at the bar or close to the entrance\" and then you'll start to wonder why he hasn't written your name down on the waitlist until a regular standing by will tell you \"this is how it works here, he memorizes your face and has a mental waitlist\".... and now you wait, wait and wait until the genius man tells you your table is ready. <br><br>4) if it wasn't clear in number 3, I waited 10 minutes to put myself on the waitlist. <br><br>4) Parking. there is valet parking for $10 but why would you do that if you can park on Clark for free. No joke, the street this restaurant is on has free parking and a couple blocks nearby have it as well. I uploaded a picture of a map that shows free parking in green on Saturday night. <br><br>5) This place is slammed from 6-9 on Saturday nights. You better be okay with having people all around you while you wait and be willing to walk through a crowd when you enter and exit. In other words, if you have claustrophobia, avoid this place during extreme busy hours. Call ahead to find out! <br><br>6) The pot pie was definitely good. But, sadly, I have to say that there are better pizza options in Chicago and the greater area. I will never ever come here if the wait is 2 hours long. 30 minutes is okay bc it will give me time to mingle with friends, anything above 1 hour is enough for me to choose elsewhere. While we were waiting in line, people were telling us it's totally worth the wait and that we'll love it... so I guess it's on you and depends on what style pizza you like. <br><br>7) Everything about this place is unique. It's special in it's own way and can't be compared to deep dish. I'll probably visit this place once a year, but it was \"one and done\" for my friends who came here. Again, there are a plethora of pizza restaurants in Chicago, and many of them are much cheaper then the $18/person you'll pay here. <br><br>8) The negatives:<br>- No jalapeños!!! Huge downside for me. The only spice you can add are the crushed peppers or tabasco sauce<br>- Our Mediterranean bread was touching the table, anyone who is in the health field knows how nasty that is (our phones, wallets/purses were in the center of the table until the waiter asked us to move it). Why can't they get bigger plates? <br>- the price. $13 for the half pounder alone. add in the appetizer and drink and you're looking at $18 easily without tip. If you're a hungry man, a one pounder is $25 which is more expensive then a deep dish pizza at peqouds that serves 4. <br>- cash only<br><br>9) No matter what I say on here, or what anyone else says, this place is banking and consistently busy.

It was good but nothing I would ever order again. My family also agreed! . Being Italian we know the difference between pasta sauce and pizza sauce and the difference between bread and pizza dough. I would definitely return for the bread and salad and would try a grinder next time. I would not wait for more than 20 mins though. I would never come on a weekend!

The bread came out pretty quickly and definitely surprised us with its flavor. I'd recommend eating it right when they bring it, because as it sits on the table it loses some of it's appeal when cold. For the pizza pot pies, they were surprisingly good and I went in with high expectations. The crust, sauce and cheese all work well together. I'd recommend against the mushrooms because I don't feel like they add much and seem to be just thrown in, rather than elevating the rest of the pie. As a big eater who has been known to polish off a whole pizza before, the one pounder is definitely enough to get you full.<br><br>The only reason for the four stars is because of the complaints others have said before. A soda is $1.75, but the refill isn't free which I haven't experienced in years. On top of that, the soda tastes kind of flat, or off for some reason, so I'd avoid it all together.

This is a cash-only joint so don't come waltzing in waving credit cards<br>2. The pizza pot pie and Mediterranean bread are all that truly matters<br>3. You should expect to wait about 2 hours on a weeknight, longer on the weekend<br>4. There is barely any parking, so take the train for pay for the valet at the restaurant<br>5. You can grab a beer from their bar and drink it while you wait to be seated<br>6.

We skipped the bread they recommended w it but next time we would try bc it looked amazing but we didn't want to overeat. The small antipasto is definitely enough for two ppl. Next, let's talk about the pot pie. We are from Chicago and have eaten at the best of the best when it comes to pizza places. In comparison, this place measured up about the same as the giordanos and the Lou malnati's of the world. The sauce could have used more authenticity. All in all, a good meal, but not great.

Their menu is pretty simple which helps narrows down the options quickly. First their salad.. based with quite a bit of iceberg lettuce and fresh veggies, it was definitely a loaded basic salad with no frills. Filling and refreshing.. huge portion for sure. The large and in charge flatbread came our and basically took over the entire table. Although thin in texture, it had a nice pillowy touch to it. Flavor wise though was just some oregano based herbs, parmesan, and olive oil. I was really underwhelmed with the flavors and even used the lemon vinaigrette dressing from the salad to use as a dipping sauce. The pot pie itself tasted exactly what you ordered: a simple marinara, with chunks of sausage and mushrooms, and piles of mozzarella in a bread bowl. I was hoping for the bowl to at least embrace some garlic essence or some kind of flavor, but I was highly disappointed as this was the main attraction. With each bite I took, I kept searching for something to tie all these separate ingredients together...<br><br>Overall, if you're looking for quantity versus quality, a neat way to fill up your social media with these huge dishes and a pizza in a bowl form, then definitely check this place out.

First of all, expect to wait for around 2 hours on a Saturday night. The line snakes throughout the restaurant and spills out into the streets with people milling about with drinks as they wait. I don't know how they kept all the people waiting straight, as there was no numbers given or names taken by the host. It was chaotic and cramped inside the small space. So the strategy is to show your face, grab a drink, wait in the open air with the rest of the herd and have faith they will remember you when a table is ready. <br><br>My second lesson is that take out is not as good as eating in. Seeing the wait, we opted for take out which takes about 20 minutes and elbowing your way back and forth through the crowd. The pizza crust was buttery and light, the sauce tangy with large pieces of mushroom and a thick layer of cheese to seal everything in.

Their meat sauce was definitely very flavorful and hearty. Mushrooms were cooked to perfection and there cheese was thick and stringy (like I like it). We also enjoyed the chefs salad. I wasn't that impressed with the salad, it was pretty basic but the two dressing were great! Overall we had a great experience. My boyfriend even change his mind about there pizza.

A half pound will comfortably feed the hungriest of the hungry and the pound is great for parties of two or more.<br><br>Since I don't eat pork, I always order the Vegetarian: Tomato sauce, brick and Swiss cheese, eggplant, onions, olives, mushrooms, red and green peppers, Romano cheese, garlic oil and Italian spices.<br><br>Also, the pizza's do take a while, which is why I would highly recommend ordering the Mediterranean bread which can comfortably serve 2-4 people.  I genuinely believe it is something that shouldn't be missed.  <br><br>This meal is pretty decadent but so worth the splurge.  Also, they're CASH ONLY!!!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I came with a friend on a Sunday around 8 pm.

It was both odd and very good! <br><br>This place does not take reservations so we had a 1.5 hour wait at 7ish on a Sunday. The way you \"sign in\" is by telling a man in the blue shirt how many. Somehow, he remembers everybody which made me a little nervous. He actually was right on point even though we actually waited 1:45 hours. I usually do not wait this long, but we were already there. <br><br>The table got the Mediterranean bread, chef salad, and each a 1/2 pound pizza. The Mediterranean bread was good, but the real star was the Italian seasoning. Really kicked the bread up! The salad was also surprisingly good! Mixing the two dressings made the difference. <br><br>The reason everybody comes is for the pizza. It is a little tough to describe, but my brother called it a lasagna in a bread bowl. The sauce was outstanding and the sausage was delectable.. I kind of wished they offerend more toppings besides sausage and mushrooms, but I probably would have ordered the same thing anyway. <br><br>Our service was also outstanding! Our server knew the menu and was able to be very attentive even though it is packed. <br><br>For the most part, the dinner was actually affordable for deep Lincoln Park. The portions are pretty large and the alcoholic drinks were big as well! <br><br>The only downsides was the confusing checking in process and that they only take cash.

After that he sat us to sit on a table next to where we grabbed the menus and said \"we have many people come here in all the time and people keep coming back\". OK? Cool, with that attitude, I surely will NOT be returning here ever again. I am a very tired traveler and the last thing I need right now is a rude \"host\".

We both got the \"vegetarian\" sauce because we are both Italian and saw pix of the meat one as well as read reviews and decided no meat sauce for us. I agree with previous reviewers that if you get the meat sauce it's essentially chili. Yuck. The bread is actually one of our favorite things!  It's this large, flat, bendable circle of dough smothered with garlic and other seasonings. You rip pieces off and eat them with or without dipping it into one of the dressings they give you for the salad.  We got the Greek salad - presented in a dish filled to the top with lettuce and tomato wedges. Loved the presentation of the salad. The manager of the place made sure to go by every table and see how things were, which is awesome. You don't get that at a lot of places. When we asked for a bowl he actually came up to us a 2nd time and talked to us about how we felt about there being too much sauce.

Foremost, let me warn you of the line. The restaurant opens at 4PM, and we arrived about 4:10 after spending the day in Lincoln Park. Ten minutes after opening, and our wait time was set at one hour! So be sure to get there a little before 4 if you don't want to wait that long. It's a small, extremely cozy restaurant, all wooden booth tables (I think only twelve tables) and a dark lighting to give it almost a medieval-like ambiance. The most fascinating part of \"putting your name in\" to wait for a table was that you actually \"put your face in\" - the hostess takes a good look at your face, asks you how many in your party, and just releases you. He remembers the order and party size of every single group! Then when it's your time to eat, he will come searching through the crowd (and literally a crowd of people waiting) to find you! And ours was spot on - one hour on the dot. <br>Now for the food: while waiting in line, multiple locals told us we had to try the Mediterranean bread and the salad, along with the pizza of course. So we did just that. The Mediterranean bread was literally MASSIVE. Hung well off the edges of a plate, a pita-like bread covered in Parmesan cheese and other seasonings. It was quite tasty! Would definitely get that again. We also got a small salad to share amongst the two of us, which was a typical Italian salad, but the two dressings made it quite lovely! We heard to mix the dressings for the best taste, which was indeed better than either of the two alone. As for the pizza, this thing is really a pizza pot pie. It comes in a dough bowl, with a scoop of marinara sauce and a heaping pile of cheese melted on top. I think it's cooked with a porcelain bowl on top, because when they brought it out, the waitress scraped the dough from the dish, then removed a bowl from the top, then flipped the pizza out! I will have to admit, the \"pizza pot pie\" thing wasn't my favorite type of pizza, though I'm sure others are fanatic about it. The dough was kind of soft (not what I wanted for a pizza crust), and I would've liked a more hearty sauce. I personally prefer classic deep dish better, but the experience of this popular place was worth the try for our first time in Chicago. <br>Overall, probably wouldn't go back to wait a long time for this place, but definitely a bucket list for Chicago first-timers if you're willing to wait.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9WcXDQAY2lO6sMP0KGWI-w/168s.jpg", "caption": "1/2 pound"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Cj2SkoEg3kjJ5X4CSODiAQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "MASSIVE Mediterranean bread, but really tasty!"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Mediterranean bread was excellent, soft and flavorful.

Waited about thirty minutes and decided carryout would be much quicker. I was right. 25 minutes beats 2 hours any day. The pizza pot pie lived up to its reputation. Very good! Salad was bland but edible. It was as if there was no (Italian) dressing in it. Maybe there wasn't? They gave us a poppyseed concoction that I really didn't like. Quarters are tight.

I have mixed opinions about service here, which is divided into roughly two different designations, Pre-seating, and Post-seating. Post-seating, the servers tend to be very attentive and knowledgeable, and can navigate a cozy space well in a way that enhances the experience. Pre-seating, you're basically treated like trash. If you come during an off time it's alright, but during busy hours the entrance way gets so cramped you're basically committing 18 different fire code violations. Once you do happen to traverse your way, like a sardine through a gulag to the front, the person taking names just asks you how many are in your party, then gives you an approximation of how long it'll take. This number always seems to be the same...I've been given a 2 hour estimate then come back 2 hours later to still have an hour wait ahead of me. You can tell that this establishment was not built to maintain the capacity that it's newfound popularity has granted it, but this is still not the most efficient system.<br><br>On to the food, tried out both their renowned pizza pot pie and Mediterranean bread. The pizza pot pie was...good. Novel at least, but I don't think it was that far removed from regular pizza that I would wait any more than 5 minutes for it. A single half-pound pot pie is runs around $12.75, but it's fairly dense so one is usually filling enough for a meal. They use their house tomato sauce(with or without sausage), and you can request wheat or white for the crust, as well as mushroom or no mushroom. When you get mushrooms, they really do just put full mushrooms in there; I wish they cut them as the whole ones are harder to eat and I end up cutting them anyways. I did like the sauce in terms of flavor; it was a bit more runny than I'd have expected but there was plenty of crust to sop it up. As far as the Mediterranean bread, it was good. Basically just a giant super pita, which we split with two people but it seems could be split among 4, as with most of the appetizers/salads here. Meal ended up being about $22pp after tax and tip, which I thought was on the steeper end for pizza.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Good luck getting in.

The pizza looks cute since it's shaped like a bowl and melty cheese on top.  Flavor wise, taste just like a regular pizza.

Mushrooms let out a decent amount of water when heated, so baking it inside the marinara sauce would just make it thinner....<br>Mediterranean bread: pesto basil and cheese is thinly spread on the flat bread, and was ok.

Waited 2+ hours on a Tuesday so I expected some BOMB food, didn't happen. <br><br>SERVICE:<br>The seating and waiting method was archaic and inefficient. You go give an old man your name and he will memorize your face and call you when you're ready. He doesn't write anything down. There aren't buzzers like there are at other popular places such as Giordanos or The Cheesecake Factory. He does not remember as well as he should've. I saw groups of two (same size as mine) put in their names later than we did and get in faster. When we asked after waiting 2 hours, he told us that we were next and asked to confirm if we were a group of 4. We weren't. In fact, I was a bit put off that he mistook us for another group because that means that he doesn't actually remember some people even though he should! Also, I don't like to drop the race card, but the only other Asians that had been waiting as long as we did were indeed in a group of 4. This means that we were bypassed many times by other group of 2's because he didn't remember us being a group of 2. It was humid, there was no place to sit or wait so we continued to suffer a little while longer. Eventually we made it in and that was a flop too. <br><br>It would've been okay if the food actually lived up to its standards...<br><br>FOOD / STAFF:<br>The pizza pot pie was not bad by any means. It was good. I'd come again if I didn't have to wait, but it's just not worth the hype. The Mediterranean Bread was large and very filling for 2. It was seasoned well, but nothing mind blowing. It was just an oversized pita bread with a bunch of herbs and cheese thrown on it. Ehhh. Decent. The actual potpies were very filling as well. The cheese was abundant, My fork and knife made cheese bridges worthy of food porn, but that was about it. I heard raves about the sauce and I just didn't think it was as good as the reviews said. It contains homemade sausages but it wasn't really anything that stood out while I was eating. I didn't get mushrooms on mine, but my boyfriend did. He got like 3 so it wasn't like the mushrooms made a difference in the meal. Last but not least, the dough. That's what it was. Dough. It was cooked but it still tasted and had the same texture as dough. I wanted something more. Maybe crispy or bread-like. I don't know. I just didn't want something so doughy and chewy. It wasn't my cup of tea and precisely why I don't think I'll wait another 2 hours to come back. <br><br>The server also wasn't personable. She was bland and just wanted to get everything done and over with so I didn't feel welcomed or warm. The whole meal felt like a business transaction despite the location having a cozy ambiance. It was strictly business. Eat. Pay. Get out. There's just so much hype around this place that I had higher expectations from the notorious seater to the good food, this place just fell flat.

The bar wasn't crowded, it was just a lazy bartender who preferred to eat his own dinner rather than serve customers (and he was eating Mediterranean takeout instead of food from the restaurant, if that's not a red flag). He was also rude when we asked if they serve food at the bar. I'm sure he is asked that a lot, but why management thinks it's a good idea to have two rows of bar seating and not serve food at the bar is beyond me.<br><br>We decided to order carryout instead of waiting another 1-2 hours since the service at the bar was so bad. We were told they couldn't give us Italian salad dressing for a to-go order unless we bought the $8 tiny bottle. They made up an excuse about not having to-go salad dressing cups, which was clearly inaccurate given the other two non-Italian salad dressings they provided. <br><br>The rest of the food was disappointingly bland. The cheese was good, but the pizza on a whole was just meh. It needed more sauce, flavor, or something. We also got a meatball grinder, being excited for the garlic bread. While the portion was very big, it ended up being a whole lot of dry, unseasoned, bland meatball. If the bread was garlic bread, we couldn't tell.

However, if you're looking for an innovative twist on pizza with fresh ingredients, a rich, complex flavor and the best combination of perfect crust, bold, rich sauce and buttery, gooey cheese, this is it! <br><br>A few tips for first timers:<br><br>1. This place is wildly popular and even more so with the recent food network feature story. On a Saturday night, expect to wait about 2 hours. As long as you plan for it and are not starving, the wait is well worth it. Check in and then walk a couple blocks over to Lincoln Park and/or Lincoln Park Zoo to see the sites and use the time wisely. Set a timer on your phone and head back about 30 minutes before the time you were told. A lot of people abandon ship after checking-in so the wait is often a bit less than you were told.<br><br>2. If you are not one for waiting, get there on a Saturday at 11:00 when they open and have lunch or try a weeknight (there will likely be a wait still, but not as long as weekends)<br><br>3. No reservations accepted. Cash only (there's an ATM in the entry if you need it)<br><br>4. They don't take names and they don't keep a physical list when you are checking-in. This may seem crazy to some, but believe me when I say the guy that checks you in knows EXACTLY where you are in line, even with a 2-hour wait and 50 people waiting. This is part of the mystique and charm of this place. Don't hover and don't keep checking-in.  He is on top of it.  The only tip...wear something that make you stand out and easy to remember. Simple as a graphic tee or a bright red blouse, etc. He remembers you from what you are wearing.<br><br>5. Order the Mediterranean bread and the side salad to share. You will not be disappointed.<br><br>6. Take home some frozen pies to keep in the freezer. You will be hooked.

I don't know how they manage things without taking anyone's name or utilizing any kind of pager alert system, but they do. When I arrived among the hordes of eager diners and asked to get on the waiting list, they simply told me the wait time (which was substantial) and said I could wait at the bar until a table was ready for me.

It's supposedly one of the most popular items on the menu and is definitely an item portioned for sharing. It's tasty as well as handy for sopping up any extra sauce from the pot pie.

By the time 4 PM came, there were only a few booths open until the crowd started piling in, so fortunately, there was not that much of wait for my best friend and I to grab a booth, which was helpful since we were on a time crunch. Our server was very attentive and friendly; we ordered the Mediterranean Bread to start with, and the half pound pizza pot pies, both of which were amazing. The Mediterranean Bread is an amazing appetizer because it has plenty of flavors and spices to it, but it is just enough to fill you up while you wait for the pies. Between my best friend and I, we still had about a quarter left of the bread to take home, so I would recommend a group to be ready to devour it together. However, regardless of the party size, it is safe to say that you cannot visit CPOG and skip out on it whatsoever. It was that good. As for the pies, they flip it upside down in front of you and it is served nice and fresh. There are a lot of different meats in the sauce that give it a stronger flavor that overpowers the dough and cheese, which is what stuck out to me the most. It was a good sauce, but almost too meaty for my liking. However, the cheese and dough were excellent and were both extremely rich in flavor. The pizza really does fill you up, so the half pounder is ideal for any meal in my opinion. The only thing I would change for my next visit is trying the vegetarian sauce option, which is a really nice option for people following a  vegetarian diet. Overall, I will definitely return as the food and service were well above my standards. Just a heads up that the place is cash only and they do not take reservations, which is different but also makes this place a classic little gem worth the hype. 4.5/5 stars in my book.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I'm upset that I was telling my boyfriend about how great this place was, and he pulled a face when I described the pizza until it was featured on a list of best pizzas (I think Chicago Magazine or Time Out) and then he couldn't stop cooing that he wanted to go.<br><br>I went once during the week and didn't wait that long.

On the one hand, the flatbread, salads, and salad dressing are awesome. On the other hand, the main thing they are known for are their pot pies, which we found to be rather boring. That leaves me with having to give a three star review, because I would go back just for the flatbread and salad, but we were so disappointed with the pot pies!<br><br>The flatbread is notorious in Chicago. It is HUGE. I don't mean huge, I mean HUGE. When I've heard people talk about it, I thought they were exaggerating. They weren't. It comes draped over a plate and takes up almost a third of the table. It is also covered in a magical mixture of dried herb and spices and possibly fairy dust?? It's fantastic. It's delicate, warm, tender, delicious flat bread that you pull apart with your hands and stuff into your hungry mouth. <br><br>The chef salad seems like a regular ole salad. It comes with lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, green and black olives, pepperoncini, onions, artichoke hearts, and green peppers, and it's served with sour cream garlic dressing, sweet and sour poppyseed dressing, and the greatest most delicious, mouth watering Italian dressing I've had in my entire life. They sell this for $7.00 a bottle and that is a deal. It's so good. <br><br>Some people may enjoy the pot pies, but I think after the hype I've heard about it, and after seeing how tasty they look coming out of the kitchen, I was disappointed with the bland, soft crust and uninteresting sauce. While I won't deny that the fresh ingredients were delicious, which included garlic, onions, green peppers, cheeses, sausage and whole mushrooms, I couldn't help but feel that it was missing some flavor. Amping up the crust would be a good start. It needs to either be cooked differently to give it a crunchy edge, or it needs some sort of additional ingredient to make it more unique. I just felt like it was this soft, sad pie crust with no character. <br><br>But, I will say we will be going back just to get salads and flatbread in the very near future.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2ATZOim-ZcWONsKU9qKCFw/348s.jpg", "caption": "Herb flatbread.

Cut it once, cut it twice, this is a cuppa-two, or tree person sandwich.<br><br>Also worth noting are their humongous salads which are truly the size of newborn infants.

I came on a Thursday night around 6:30 with a party of four and we waited about an hour and a half. The \"check in\" system is a bit odd because you don't put a name down or anything, the guy just says he will remember you. Hm. We were concerned at first but in the end had no problems being remembered and being seating. The only thing we ordered were the pizza pot pies. They take about half an hour, but again, worth the wait. A half-pound pizza pot pie is enough for one hungry person. I ate just about all of mine. It was so, so good. The sauce is more of a bolognese than a pizza sauce, but I think that's what makes it so good. It's a delicious meat sauce and just goes wonderfully with the button mushrooms, tons of melted brick cheese, and chewy crust. I would definitely eat here over many Chicago deep dish pizza places but make sure you understand that it's not really pizza and will not have the same taste. In addition, our server was incredibly friendly and the atmosphere is very cool--kind of an old world pub feel.

I was told it would take half an hour for to go. It took about 45 minutes. The total was a little less than $55 and they only accept cash. They have an ATM that I used for a $3 fee. We got home and dug in. The pot pie was VERY mediocre. The fact that we ordered to go could've been a factor. My boyfriend did enjoy the mushrooms inside. The salad was generous but average.

In the past I have had their amazing salad dressing, and believe me when I say, no other dressing beats CPOG's. <br><br>My husband and I came here one night at around 10:00pm and it was still quite busy. The restaurant is in the lower level of a brownstone, so you can imagine how cramped it feels. That aside, the atmosphere was still pretty enjoyable for the most part. All of the staff was very friendly and attentive, which was awesome given the crowded environment.<br><br>The food was delicious. We had salad, the mediterrannean bread, and one of their famous deep dish pizzas. Now I will say that I am not a fan of Chicago style deep dish pizza, and have been dragged to many well known pizza places in the city and have been dissappointed by the lasagna-esque dish that is Chicago style deep dish pizza. CPOG hands down has the best deep dish pizza I've ever had, it was absolutely delicious. Of course the salad was delicious as well, being that they serve it with their amazing dressings. The mediterannean bread was way too overpowering with parmesean cheese and whatever else spices they put on it. <br><br>The only thing that I really don't appreciate about this restaurant is the fact that they only accept cash. Most people do not just carry around cash, and if you are planning on dining at this restaurant you will need a lot of it.

When we went on a weekday around 5:00 they were not too busy at all and we had no problems getting seated.<br><br>The restaurant is in a good location with plenty of street parking nearby. I believe they offer valet parking on the weekend, but we haven't had any problems finding street parking. The place has a very intimate atmosphere, it would be an ideal stop for a date or small group.<br><br>The food is superb. We didn't stray from their most popular items; the mediterranean bread and pizza pot pie. You have a choice of white or whole grain and a vegetarian version of the pizza pot pie is available. There are many reviews of the food, so I wont go into anymore detail than that. It tastes excellent and it's the reason to go there, try it and you shouldn't be disappointed. <br><br>We joked that this place thrives on being your stereotypical chicago restaurant. By that I mean it is similar to the Hot Dog joints that serve their product to you their way and that's the only way. It's part of the experience, but they can be rather difficult with their company policies. The soft drinks are small/watered down and they do not offer free refills. In a world where free soft drink refills are an industry standard, I really don't get that policy. Also don't get too picky when ordering your pizza pot pie, because there is very little that they will allow you to special order when it comes to ingredients/toppings. Also remember that they do not accept credit cards, you will need cash. <br><br>So you will wait for the privilege of being seated, pay for soda refills, eat the food the way they prepare it, pay for your meal the way they tell you to, and somehow walk away feeling fortunate for the opportunity to eat there?

We have seen it shown multiple times on various shows over the years, and we have always said we have to try it if we ever find our way to Chicago.<br><br>Well last week we made it to Chicago, and so our obvious dinner choice was the pizza pot pie from Chicago Pizza & Oven Grinder. I wanted to give them 5 stars, but I'll explain where all the stars went...<br><br>- Minus one star because of the horrendous wait times, the unwillingness to take reservations, and the oaf running the joint who refuses to keep a documented list of parties waiting for tables. I asked, \"don't you want to take my name?\" He replied, \"no, I can remember everyone's faces and I know who's next\". Fair enough... except he kept my party waiting while he allowed several other parties to bypass us in line for tables. When I challenged him on it, he apologized and said we would be next... and then he promptly seated two more parties who were behind us in line. Our total wait was over 1 hour, which wouldn't have been so bad except for the fact that 25 other people were standing in the waiting area with their rear ends in our faces while we sat down to wait.<br><br>- Minus one star because the food is grossly overpriced for what it is. We spent $46 on a couple of pizza pot pies and a couple of sodas. It was just enough for two people. And this isn't gourmet food. I'd probably comfortably pay about $20 for what we ate. That's what it was worth.<br><br>- Minus one star because you have to pay for refills on sodas. $3 gets you a tiny glass of soda and each refill is another $2. Who does that?<br><br>- Minus one star because this place only accepts cash. Really? Not even VISA? I was only carrying enough cash to cover the food and one drink each, so the waiter went without a tip and I couldn't even afford to pay for the refill that I really wanted.<br><br>- Minus one star because the oaf of an owner kept rushing us to finish eating and clear the table so he could seat another party. He stared at us throughout our meal, and kept walking by our table grunting about the fact that we were not done eating yet.<br><br>So that's 5 stars minus 5 stars = 0 stars.

I had a few deals with the pizza: the mushrooms are whole, so I ended up with 3 bites that had mushrooms and no others; the sausage tasted like ground beef without a lot of flavor; and the pizza wasn't very seasoned in and of itself - I added the seasoning at the table to give it a little oomph. <br><br>I wanted to love it, but couldn't get there.

The dressings are house-made and actually pretty good, though the sweeter dressing was way too sweet.<br><br>Mediterranean Bread - their most popular item, apparently. A large, thin piece of what I think is pizza dough, with toppings like Italian herbs/spices (seemingly dried and from a jar) and parmesan falling off the bread and all over the place. More oil or butter might have helped so that the toppings stick. We found this bread only okay.<br><br>Meatball Oven Grinder - a monster of a grinder. Way too little red sauce. Meatballs were way too dry. Bread wasn't very interesting - for an oven-baked grinder, the bread didn't have that nice crunch that I expect oven-baked bread to have. This was not good at all.<br><br>Service - pretty great. Very attentive server.

Going beyond that, if I were to ever take a visitor of the Chicago-land area anywhere to eat a truly authentic Chicago-Style-Pizza or simply receive a Chicago-style-experience, Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder Company is the place to go. <br><br>You start by walking down a busy main street in the heart of the Chicago-land area with small shops and the Lincoln Park Zoo all in walking distance (the location is pristine, immediately get a Chicago-feel). You walk into a small incandescent building with cramped small walk areas that make you feel at home and cozy (at least in my opinion). You get immediately greeted by a \"more experienced\" gentleman whom fits the Italian look of Chicago-Style pizza and dinning to a tee. He also somehow someway, does not use a paper to write down names on the waiting list yet simply remembers each individuals name, time of arrival, and group size to be placed at tables accordingly (AND HE NEVER MESSES UP!) Hes truly amazing and for that, our experience at the restaurant was immediately more heart felt and homie. Infact, my family and I used to go in there maybe once every 6 months or so when wed take a more expansive visit to the city and after the second time going there, the man ACTUALLY remembered our family and even my fathers name... IT WAS AWESOME! <br><br>The entire restaurants layout is very tight and jam packed, usually finding yourself having to squeeze through the isles between servers and other guests just to get around (making it feel homie and cozy, in my opinion yet again). You get seated and a waiter is at your table within the minute you are sat and brings waters for everyone to start off with. All the waiters that we have dealt with have been extremely knowledgeable about the menu and even the Chicago history and pizza magic that comes from Chicago as well! I don't believe there has been a time that i have visited the establishment and haven't learned something new or interesting about either the restaurant, Chicago's pizza history, or Chicago in itself! The entire vibe and atmosphere of the restaurant is relaxing, dark lit, and cozy to feel relaxed and able to unwind with whomever it is your sharing a meal with. <br><br>The menu is also very well designed with the building imprinted on the paper and the items placed around it making it feel continuously at one with itself and well thought out, makes you feel like the owners truly thought of every aspect before starting up the business. The menu is simple and clean with items placed accordingly from Pizza Pot Pies (the OG), to Oven Grinders and the DELICIOUS Mediterranean Bread. <br><br>The food is impeccable and truly a Chicago taste to the heart... I will vouche for this place day in and day out. They truly gave an EXPERIENCE not just a meal for a dinner. Its not about how good the food tastes at a restaurant but how your entire body and soul feels upon leaving its establishment. And i can truly say, i feel AWESOME each time i leave.

I waited 1.5 hours and wasn't pleased with what I got. It was a unique idea i.e. pizza pot pie but really just tasted like warm bread with bolognese sauce on it and melted cheese. Nothing special, the two full mushrooms underneath didn't add much flavor-wise either. It tasted bland and uninspired. Then, I went to pay and apparently it's cash only. There are no signs visible on the outside that this is the case (I didn't see one inside either). This would have been nice to know so I could make arrangements during the endless wait. Instead, I found out right as I was going to pay and by then, I was in a rush and found this out. They asked me to use the ATM in the place, which wouldn't take my credit card (even though it's never had any issues at any other place). They told me I'd have to walk down the street and find a bank ATM to pay. I did, and that cost me $3.50 in ATM fees and a whole lot of stress rushing back to the restaurant to try to rush back to my next event. It was an absolutely ridiculous experience. Good food is worth waiting for, but I didn't find it at Oven Grinder. In addition, it's hard to believe that in 2017 patrons are expected to pay cash only. Most people don't carry cash any more. This establishment really made it as inconvenient as possible to eat there. At the very least, have other payment options, and an ATM that actually works. I really didn't appreciate my ATM fees or the hassle. This place needs to at least have clear signage up that says Cash Only. This is the only bad restaurant experience I had in Chicago over the course of a week. I highly recommend Lou Malnati's for a delicious experience and great customer service.

Well since the booth on the other side of the women had just sat down, that meant when OUR table was done they could take it over. From that point on, we felt uncomfortably rushed. The women were clearly uncomfortable and kept talking about how cramped they were and how it would be OK because the table over there (our table) was almost done.

A \"doorknob\" sized mushroom was tucked into the middle of the pot pie and added, if anything, a distraction from the meal as it was bulky, crunchy, and too large to be cooked in proportion to the dish.<br><br>I left the restaurant far less than satisfied with the main course, but it wasn't bad. I think it has room for improvement, but that's just my opinion. The place was packed and they were serving more pizza pot pies than I could count, so someone must like them!<br><br>All in all, we ran up a bill for about $110, not including tip (three beers, two appetizers, a grinder and three \"half pound\"  pizza pot pies). Seems like a lot of $$ for some fast causal caliber \"Italian\" food. Felt like a lot of $$ when I had to count out cash. This is a note to take.... the restaurant is ***CASH ONLY***.

We all agreed it was worth it, because the pizza pot pies and Mediterranean bread are excellent. We ended up waiting 2 hours. Not a big deal. But then we got to our table. Our server, Brandon (?) was curt at best. I felt like cattle getting hurried through our meal. Boxes were dropped while we were still eating, dessert was brought while our dinner was still on the table, and the check was dropped before we started our dessert. Look, I get it. We're all servers. It's busy. We certainly weren't going to sit after our meal for an hour talking, there are other people that have been waiting for 2 hours and I would never do that to the server who is trying to make money. But he didn't even pretend to be nice to us (after we waited two hours). I've had more patient service at McDonalds.

This isn't pizza!\"<br><br>Me: \"You're absolutely right. It's a 1/2 lb of passionate pleasure\"<br><br>Goodness gracious I still don't know what the 1/2 pounder is but I know for certain one thing it is NOT, and that is any regular run-of-the-mill pizza. It comes out looking like an overflowing chicken pot pie with its love handles drooping all over the sides. But then they flip it over on your plate and shave off the container to reveal a smoking inside bundle of rich cheese and meat sauce (mind you it is hot. they tell you to let it sit for a second but the first time I was so enthralled that my hands moved on their own and . . . well . . . ) <br><br>Eating through it the first time might be a bit perplexing but rest assured, your knife and fork will eventually figure it out. While this is a \"pizza place\", you'll quickly discover that the 1/2 pounder is definitely a little more non-traditional, which is aptly highlighted by the homemade sauce. This sauce reminded me more of a spaghetti meat sauce but about ten thousand times more sophisticated and tastier...and thankfully, there is a lot of it. If you generally like your pizzas with more cheese and less tomato sauce, then this may not be the experience for you but then again, this really shouldn't be treated like a pizza. While it does have many of the traditional components, it really is a different dining experience altogether so comparing it to a deep dish or regular pizza may not be the most productive.<br><br>That being said, the overall 1/2 pounder is well put together. The dough crust has a nice balance of soft/fluffy and chewy which is perfectly complemented with the sauce. You may wish you had a little more dough seeing as the sauce and cheese is aplenty so if you have some change to spare, order up some Mediterranean Bread for a little dipping action.<br><br>Prices are not the greatest considering the portion but fairly reasonable considering how damn good the food is.

A nice, old guy told us the wait was 45-55 minutes and just like that, he somehow inputs all the hungry patrons faces and wait times into his memory. Quite impressive. As our wait time neared the 50 minute mark, I found the guy again and he said 10 more minutes. Well approaching the 70 minute mark, we were finally seated and a few minutes later, he comes with complimentary Mediterranean bread since we waited longer than expected! :D <br><br>The bread is practically 1-1.5 feet in diameter holstered by a salad plate in the middle.

It was baked \"upside down\" - in a bowl, the meat, homemade tomato sauce, doorknob mushrooms and cheese are baked with the pot pie crust on top which resembles a short mushroom. The server then flips it over and removes the dish and the cheesy, meaty concoction oozes into the crust and a pizza pot pie is born. The sauce is sweet from the tomatoes yet very hearty as they are very very generous with the meat. The cheese is so gooey in classic chicago-style pizza manner. <br><br>We all got the half-pounders individually and while for most, it would be too much, but for some (fatties like me) it is enough to make you full but not over the top.

With our combined 108 years, it was safe to assume that we'd already tried thin crust, deep dish, and stuffed. What we hadn't tried? Pot pie style pizza. Let me tell you, the comfort of pot pie should never be easily translated into pizza. It's unfair to the traditionally creamy broth of a pot pie uninhabited by marinara. It's unfair to the standard pizzas of Chicago that work hard every day, trying to make a name for themselves, getting jazzed up in ingredients only to get outshone by the attraction of a pot pie styled version of themselves.

Our consensus was that an iceberg filled salad saved the night. <br><br>My final thought, it's fun to try once, but I wouldn't come back. <br>Seems like the real tragedy this side of Clark is the pizza.

I'm not sure what the program was or what the channel was (WGN? WTTW?), but all I know is that they were in the kitchen of this place showing me how they make their pizza pot pie. Blew. My. Mind. I worked at a pizza joint for awhile, so it was particularly interesting to me, I think. After that I forgot about it for awhile until I decided to look it up. Took me a bit to figure out the name of the place again... it isn't the most intuitive or clever restaurant name.<br><br>After I finally figured it out, I decided try to go past it if I was in the area. Soon, I found myself skating past the area on Clark and saw a huge crowd sitting on a stoop. Then I saw the sign for the restaurant. This place is either really popular or really small. A week or so later I ran past it. Same thing. Ok, now I HAVE to try this place out.<br><br>I eventually got a friend and my brother to venture out and eat at this place. My friend and I got there early, walked past the crowd and went inside. Once inside, we looked around completely confused. Eventually a guy came up to us, told us the time it would take to get a seat and said \"you can stay or you can go and come back\", then walked away. Is this guy serious? Apparently he was. I guess not taking names is his 'thing'? It seems to work though. After having a Sophie at the bar, we got a seat in about the time he said we would and we never had to badger him.<br><br>So, as it turns out, I was right - this place is dark, wooden, and really, really small. Very narrow and not all that deep. Throw in the bar area, and there isn't much eating area. The actual booths are large though, so once you are seated it doesn't seem too cramped. The waiter gave us our menus and we looked it over. The first thing we noticed was that there was not a lot of food choices to choose from. The second thing we noticed was the story on the back. This story was so crazy that we decided to read it out loud. I won't spoil it, but it seemed to emphasize the fact that some random lawyer founded it. Not so sure if I'd stress that.<br><br>Ordering wasn't a big deal though. We were all there for this pizza pie thing. We also grabbed a flat bread as an appetizer. The bread came and was delicious, and we waited for our pies. Soon, they came as well and they looked great. Then we ate them. Not as great as I was hoping. The real problem is they really don't have a pizza taste to them at all. The meat sauce really makes it taste like some sort of pasta. That isn't to say it didn't taste good, but it just wasn't what I was expecting. I feel you should know that going in. Maybe that way you'll like it more than I did.<br><br>I'd be interested in going back for a grinder, but the pizza really didn't do it for me. Great experience though. I don't regret going at all.

She explained the menu starting with the Pizza Pot Pie. She explained the Half and Full serving, explaining that \"half\", as she gestured with her hands to describe the size, was a decent serving for one. Then referring to the \"full\" she expanded her hand gesture hardly a half an inch to demonstrate the size of the \"full\" explaining it was \"a hearty serving for 2\" mind you the Full is more than double the price of the half at a whopping $27. I'm guessing full and half refers to the price not the portions. We nearly laughed in her face.<br><br>She then explained how the pot pie was prepared and served and staunchly proclaimed, \"no exceptions, thats how its served\". Which I gathered to mean, no one likes how its served and she gets complaints all the time and this is her best attempt at covering her butt. This was the beginning of a long painful lesson that carried on the whole night.<br><br> The cooks, waitresses, manager and owner are extremely lazy and rude, they wont do anything for you, they just pump their crappy selection out the kitchen like an assembly line.<br><br>We passed on the pot pie, got the grinders and were horrified. First they are served with a very large side of steamed green peppers. What?! Excuse me?! What type of cuisine is this? Have you ever in your life eaten hard, undercooked green peppers with your food as a side?! Honestly, I didnt know this was typical ANYWHERE ON PLANET EARTH.<br><br>The \"grinders\" were also stuffed with an extra helping of green peppers and the bread was so puffy and dry that we asked for a side of tomato sauce to dip. We were told,<br><br> \"it comes how its served\" <br><br>What? is that your way of telling me to screw off?<br><br> We said, seriously we'd just like a small amount of sauce to dip in, charge us for it if you want. <br><br>The answer, \"I cant do that, thats how its served\". <br><br>Forget the fact that you're a complete idiot, I'm a paying customer, if you're customer wants sauce get him some sauce! <br><br>Finally we asked for the manager, I explained, \"besides everything else that is wrong with this place we'd just like some tomato sauce for this sandwich because its TOO DAMN DRY!\"<br><br>The answer, \"No, I cant give you any sauce\". <br><br>I said, \"listen see the sauce that is on the sandwich, take some of that from the giant pot back there and put it in a small place or bowl...that's it!\" <br><br>The answer, \"no, there are no sides\". <br><br>I'm not sure what kept us from getting up, saying F@$&# You and leaving but we all sat in amazement going over different scenarios of how we'd like to flip the tables over, stomp the staff with our boots and leave..<br><br>In short the food was terrible, the customer service was so far below any standard that they shouldn't be in business and I would STRONGLY recommend you avoid this place.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "It had been hyped to me by many sources, so when I came here with Nicole B., August K., and a few other friends, I was pretty excited.

This is where the second star comes in as it was tasty and layered in something I would put on every piece of bread I would eat. Overall for the $7 or so I pad for it, this left me the most satisfied.<br>Finally our food comes and we are greeted to a $10 dollar baby pizza. The table awes as some magical process procures what promises to be culinary miracles. As we each bit in, we wondered if Chef Boyardee was in the kitchen or if they got the sausage from some lunchables. The portion was tiny, sausage of the lowest quality, whole mushrooms instead of a slice (preference), and just a bland taste. If I knew I was going to get this low quality of product I would've literally got a frozen pizza for half the price and triple the quality. This probably is the worst pizza I've had in Chicago.<br>After halfway through the pizza and a table full of former friends at this point who want my head on a platter for making them wait for this garbage, it occurs to me that everyone in the place is talking about Ohio, something back at home, or how this is delicious. This is not an actual pizza place for citizens (it may have been at once), but rather this is a tourist trap restaurant.

I found the bad reviews pretty spot-on which describe the pizza pot pie as bland or overrated. My hubby and I both thought the pot pies were really not flavorful, were too salty, and tasted too \"one-note\" without any depth coming from all the ingredients in there. It tasted worse than any frozen pizza I've ever had. I had the meat pot pie with wheat crust, and hubby had the vegetarian pot pie with white crust. Both were equally bad. I hate waiting all week to indulge, only to feel I didn't enjoy it, especially since it's rare for me to meet a pizza I don't like. I want the pizza to tingle my tastebuds, but this pot pie didn't. We knew it was bad when I couldn't eat the leftovers at home. If you have the word \"pizza\" in your name, you should do it well. I am shocked there are lines of people waiting to try this. I wanted to tell them that they could, in my opinion, get much better pizza at La Madia, Malnati's, Pizzeria Uno/Due, Pequod's, etc. Lines and great reviews on Yelp don't always equal good (ie Bongo Room, blech). <br><br>Some positives (ok, mixed with a negative or two) of Chicago Pizza & Oven Grinder Co:<br>Small chef's salad was huge for the price and very fresh.

Maybe I should have added dressing and the seasonings onto the pizza pot pie to help it out. As much as we enjoyed the salad, I wouldn't go back just for a salad, as I never will eat a salad as an entree.<br>Mediterranean bread was delicious, and we used some of the dressings to dip it in. I agree it is unhygienic to have it so large that it drapes over the plate and onto your wooden table. <br>If you're a couple sharing a salad and Mediterranean bread, I think sharing one small pot pie (if you dare) is enough unless you want leftovers.<br>We got a table for 2 right away around 4:45pm (it was either a Friday or Saturday).

They give you three options, a sweet poppyseed, sour cream and garlic, or traditional Italian.  <br><br>I always get a Half-Pounder vegetarian pizza pot pie with white crust ....pepperoni slices on the side.  NOTE: The original comes with Italian sausage and mushrooms.  You can also get wheat crust.  Pepperoni only comes on the side. <br><br>This place isn't your run-of-the-mill pizza place.

It's always something. My friends and I joke about the place constantly.<br><br>Let's start off positive: I l-o-v-e the salads. All of them. Because as weird as it sounds, salads are my favorite food. Mediterranean flat bread is good too but you have to share b/c it's freaking HUGE---- just like many of the asses sitting in the restaurant right now---- just like how your ass will be if you go there too often.

We go for the salads.<br><br>Now let's get negative. First off, who is the guy who wanders around the restaurant and attempts to seat you?  You have to wait forever to get his attention, other people are waiting, the waiting entryway is cramped, and the host-guy-whatever-he-is is no where to be found (happened to me 4x thus far).  Then when you do get his attention, he is not nice. He kind of grunts to find out how many people are in your party then just walks away.  He doesn't write your name on a list. You are now on an imaginary list.... in his head & you hope he doesn't forget that you were here before the 4 other groups waiting. (Ooops! He does forget sometimes! Feck!)  <br><br>Anyway, so when you get to your table, you think you want and hope for one of the wooden booths. They look comfy right? Ummm no. They are old, and the panel that serves as your seat back is always loose so that the big people in the booth behind you push their fat backs against the board and push you into your food. Fabulous.  Then, finally..... do you have any special requests? Hopefully not because fuck your special requests.  What? You would like some extra pizza sauce with your meal? \"I'm sorry, we don't do that.\" WTF DOES THAT MEAN?! WHAT DO YOU MEAN \"WE DON\"T DO THAT?!\" Last time I checked, you damn well SHOULD.<br><br>My take, go there for the salads or if you are looking to increase your BMI value. After thinking about it for a long while w/ many friends in the restaurant business we have decided the reason they don't give you extra pizza sauce is because.... wait for it.... they cant!  They probably don't make the pizza-pot-pies themselves. They are probably made elsewhere and brought in frozen.  If they gave you any sauce, it would not be the sauce in your pie. Shady, shady, shady, either way.  TOTALLY MAKE SURE TO ASK FOR EXTRA PIZZA SAUCE--- just to be a dick.  See what happens. My last piece of advice if you do end up going is if you have the choice between beer and wine, CHOOSE WINE.  Sure, pizza and beer are perfect mates but a well over-poured glass of wine is sooooooooo much better than a beer of the same price. Be a cheap drunk get the wine and make it the cab.

An honest product with a presence, a substance, a fragrance, and a taste\" was a perfectly spiced garlicky flatbread, which is worth coming for alone.  We were able to split a salad between our entire group - while it was a rather standard iceberg lettuce salad, their unique dressing dressed it up quite well.  The pizza pot pies are fun and different, although the sauce was not particularly memorable.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "My fabulous \"Sex and the Second City\" gal pal introduced me to the Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder Company.  I am SO glad that she did!<br><br>The Pizza Pot Pie is fabulous.  It's completely unique in the world of pizza.  It's a pizza for one made with triple-raised Sicilian bread-type dough.  The homemade sauce compliments the sausage and doorknob-size (no kidding) fresh mushrooms.  It makes for an extremely tasty and hearty meal.  <br><br>I prefer the Pizza Pot Pie to Chicago deep dish pizza.  Chicago deep dish is too thick and cheesy for me.  Please don't shoot me for my deep dish heresy; after all this place has purportedly witnessed bloodshed before.  It is thought to have been a lookout for the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in 1929. <br> <br>The salads and Mediterranean Bread at CPaOGC are both very tasty and the portions are HUGE.  The homemade dressings are delicious as well.  This is definitely not a place for diners on a diet.<br><br>It's in the basement of a quaint building and the atmosphere is very quirky, but in a good way.  With all the wooden booths, it looks a bit like \"Cheers\" crossed with \"Bonanza.\"  Prepare to wait a while as the line can be insane, but it's worth it.<br><br>Please note the restaurant accepts cash only.  This is definitely a place that gives you very good value-for-your-dollar.  If you leave this place hungry, it's your own damn fault, honey.<br><br>This place is a must when dining out in Chicago.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The only reason I'm giving 4 stars and not 5 is because the wait times are INSANE.
