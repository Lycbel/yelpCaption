I arrived at quarter to 8pm on a Wednesday night needing just a seat for me. There was a 30 minute wait. Their process is innovative where you place your pizza order first while you wait, and by the time you're seated your pizza should be ready because of the long cooking process of the crust and pizza. <br><br>I ordered a personal pizza and the chicken Marsala pasta. I am no deep dish conneissour, but the previous restaurant that I tried deep dish, I was not impressed. So, if I didn't like the pizza here, at least I'd be able to enjoy the pasta. I will say that $10.75 for a personal size pizza is a bit ridiculous as this is football stadium pricing, but that pretty much seems to be the norm. The personal pizza was good, better than the first I had at a competitor, but def not enough for dinner... more like an appetizer or snack. So IMO, even as one person for dinner I'd order a small pizza. The pasta on the other hand was loaded with chicken and mushrooms and super filling! Thankfully the chicken breast was cut up unlike other Marsalas where you're given the full breast. <br><br>Although the restaurant was packed service ran smoothly, and I was constantly being checked on. <br><br>Malnati's takes no reservations, but they do deliver with a small radius around each restaurant if you're not keen to in restaurant wait times.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oLv-j-L0y-LoZDuhDGexFA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Personal Malnati"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fQ8h1bNVA71HU9F0Nu800w/168s.jpg", "caption": "Chicken Marsala pasta"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "The sauce killed it for me.

Maybe it's a texture issue. Maybe it's because I prefer and love thin crust pizza, and I didn't order thin crust pizza which maybe I probably should? Everyone is also talking about this butter crust, and I don't think we ordered any butter crust because I don't remember anything really special or redeemable about the crust - I just know it was this huge pizza that was deep dish that came to the table and I felt like the sauce was kind of weird, robust and overly sweet. Just totally not my thing. I also found it to be really greasy.<br><br>They also served family style salad which really wasn't anything to write home about. <br><br>But the reason I'm giving it four stars is because the service is impeccable - they come and check on you, make sure all your drinks or refilled, they make any sort of special accommodation for you. The ambience is pretty darn cool and I researched this family and they're just so generous about giving back to the community. <br><br>So perhaps my taste buds were off that night. Perhaps I wasn't in a great place because I was checking out colleges and my kids gonna leave me. - boohoo! <br><br>So perhaps maybe if I come on a different night I'll like the pizza.

(Actually, your stomach might regret it when you need to unbutton those pants) But seriously, this appetizer is what I'd give Lou Malnati's a 5 stars for! The crispy pizza chip were like a soft pita chip that held all the dips very well. They were all topped with its own herbs, spices, and chopped tomatoes too. But the real winners here are these dips: roasted garlic, artichoke, and giardiniera-topped hummus. Wow, each of them were so delicious and flavored with my favorite being the artichoke dip for sure. I was honestly satisfied just having this dip and chips already.<br><br>As for the deep dish pizza, the Lou was a combination of spinach mix, mushrooms, and sliced roma tomatoes covered with blend of mozzarella, romano, and cheddar cheese on garlic buttercrust. I think the veggie toppings were not exactly my favorite choice, especially with sliced tomatoes on top so I was already a bit put off. As a cheese lover, I found that the cheese was too excessive and stringy as well. I only had one slice and had to call it quits.<br><br>When it comes to deep dish pizza in Chicago, everyone has their own preference and favorites.

We took no time to decide. The menu was easy to decipher. <br><br>For an appetizer, we chose the Spinach Stuffed Bread. It was enough for three people, but anymore and we would have ordered an additional appetizer. Marinara sauce came with, which added some bold tomato and herbie flavor.

The medium feeds three people, but we could have ordered the small for the three of us. We ended up leaving with pizzza leftover, which no complaints!  The deep dish itself was so filling, cheesy, and full of luscious sausage chunks. The sauce itself wasn't too acidic or tomato tasting. The crust was my favorite part- it almost tasted like a pastry. Not sweet, but buttery and soft. Not greasy at all! We all ate one piece and called it quits; amateurs, I know. <br><br>Our server was so friendly. And if I stopped right there, I'd rate this review a four star. The circulation of this restaurant is horrible. Our waters were only filled once during the beginning and once during the end. It took awhile for our server to give us our check and even longer to give it back. I watched our server take our check, serve a different table food, then another table their drinks, then finally returned with our check. The table next to us sat down before us and waited longer than us to get their check. It's busy, I get that. But for a popular restaurant, there should be more of a flow.<br><br>The food is great. I wouldn't eat it on the regular because it's so heavy. But, it's a great representation of deep dish, if you've never had it. The service is two star- I've had better.

As a New Yorker, I was not used to that long of a wait for pizza because in New York, you can get your pizza within seconds to minutes of ordering. <br><br>When the pizza came, the server served it to us on our plates. These pizzas are generous with cheese, so perfect for a cheese lover! The server was patient and greatly accommodating. She recommended us items on the menu to get since it was our first time in Chicago trying deep dish. <br><br>The pizza is really filling and you have to use a fork and knife to eat. Two slices will get anyone full. The pizza that I ordered was for 2 people, it came with 4 slices and I was not able to finish my portion of the pizza. The pizza had a perfect ratio of cheese, topping, as well as tomato sauce.

We also ordered a side of buffalo wings to split as an app which had a nice kick. <br><br>We went on a Monday night around 7 pm for dinner. When checking in w/ the host to place or name for a table, we were handed a menu to preorder our pizza since the wait time for a deep dish pizza can be quite long. However, we got seated almost immediately upstairs and placed our order then. We were given a wait time of 40 minutes for the pizza. Service was great overall. Our server constantly came to check on us to be sure we were doing ok throughout the wait time.

Another factor, we had two different flavors. Here at Lou Malnati's, we picked the Chicago style. The sausage was so tender and the sauce was just enough.

Your face might get so numb because of the bitter cold that you may forget how many ears or noses you have. However, if you survive, you will get to enjoy some of the best deep dish pizza the city has to offer at Lou Malnati's. <br><br>Here are my ratings based on different criteria:<br><br>Quality of food: Great. We got the deep dish with cheese. I suggest ordering a size small for a group of 2 as you'll each get to have 2 slices. For a thin crust, 2 slices is not enough, however, for a deep dish this is more than enough. If one has never had a deep dish pizza before, it has basically a thick buttery crust with a lot of cheese and tomatoes piled on top. So...2 slices for lunch will have you pretty full. Lou's pizza is best compared to the competition as the sauce is not too tangy or sweet but seasoned just right. Also, the crust is not overly buttered up. The knife cuts through the crust with a nice pop proving that the crust is baked just right.<br><br>Decor: Kinda cool. Every location has a different theme but this one is all about baseball. There are all kinds of White Sox and Cubs memorabilia everywhere. From autographed team jerseys to baseballs neatly displayed in a case, this Lou's is a haven for Chicago baseball lovers.<br><br>Cleanliness: No complaints. All the tables and floor were kept clean and crumbs free! <br><br>Service: Friendly but very busy. The place was absolutely packed at 1 pm on a Saturday. This kept the staff very busy and looking stressed. The entrance area had so many people hanging out that it was impossible to get in/out and almost made it a fire hazard.<br><br>Speed of food preparation: As expected...for a deep dish pizza. Something to keep in mind when ordering a deep dish pizza is that because of the thick crust and heavy amount of toppings, your pizza will normally take 35 minutes to make. If a restaurant claims to have a deep dish ready for you in 15 minutes then either they are reheating an old pizza or not serving a true deep dish pizza.<br><br>Price: cheap. Our small pizza was $15. A glass of Root Beer with free refills for $2.75. A relatively cheap lunch for 2 if you ask me!<br><br>Everybody has their own favorite spot in Chicago for a true deep dish pizza. That's what makes this city great!

We put our name down at the front desk, then went to the right hand side to order our pizza, so by the time we got a table it would only take 20-30 minutes more to wait for the pizza. <br><br>We knew we wanted salad and pizza. We ordered the Malnati's salad, which was pleasantly surprising with the sweet vinaigrette and salami bits drizzled over big leafy greens and romaine lettuce. Not sure if we were just ravenous but it was an amazing salad we would be happy to order again. If you're not as hungry, I suggest ordering the smaller size that can serve 2-3 people. If you're very hungry, go for the family size that serves between 4-6 people. Then the Malnati Chicago classic deep dish pizza came! With my first bite, I was greeted by a thick doughy and cheesy goodness. As I was halfway through the slice, I noticed the dough got doughier, the cheese thicker and the meat meatier, which was heavy for my taste. I really wanted more tomato sauce than meat and cheese, but the tomato sauce seemed sparse. I think this was a great introduction to authentic Chicago deep dish, and I'd likely come back!

Pizza is something you can dine on-the-go and a very hands-on experience. Deep dish requires too much preparation .. Anyhow, seeing that this establishment was so highly reviewed, I was excited to come here but, man, the service here is SLOW to borderline despicable. We came in on a Sunday afternoon and was seated without reservation in maybe 10 minute. They encourage you to order the pizza before you get seated because the pie takes about 30 mins to make. So we went to the 2nd floor dining area, and it took the waitress at least 15 minutes before she introduced herself and another 5-10 minutes before we got our water. For a chain restaurant (they have multiple locations; reminds me of a localized Olive Garden), that's unacceptable. I overheard nearby patrons complaining about the same thing - \"The waitress looked swamped\" or \"She's never around\" .. but it seemed like she was manning 6 tables/parties max. I don't know if they're understaffed or just poorly trained. I know, as a waitress in NYC, the service we received would never fly. <br><br>Anyhow, we ordered a calamari and two personal pies - the original and the meat. The calamari was standard; nothing terribly interesting beyond that they served it with a shrimp cocktail sauce which was strange and took some adjustment due to the unexpected tartness. I really enjoyed the meat but it reminded me of a casserole; the meat provided an unexpected umami flavor that was lacking in the original, which was composed of tomatoes, spinach, etc. Surprisingly, the crust was crispy but also borderline hard .. a great contrast to the moist meat/vegetables which were meh at best. Warning: portion sizes are huge; two personal pies were sufficient between two people.

Right off the bat she looked stressed. Was she overwhelmed with such a large group to tend to? Who knows. She made it clear that she was in a hurry and not in any position to be polite. My colleague is Vegan so we asked if they had Vegan options on the menu. No, the pizza is not vegan. We then asked about the bruschetta. Her reply, and I quote, \"are you always this annoying, or is it just today?\" My head exploded! Because I was with work colleagues I didn't snap. I wasn't the only one who kept mum. Tonya/Terry really didn't want to ask about the bread. In a tone that was forthright, yet polite, I requested that she ask the kitchen about the Bruschetta, just to be sure. She did. Anyway, the bruschetta wasn't vegan. I forget what my colleague ordered. <br><br>The rest of the team went H.A.M on the deep dish.

I am here to tell you that you do not need to size up to leave with extra pizza.

Next, the salad arrived.  I waited so long, I wanted another beer.  The delivery person dropped off the salad and split, so, there was no chance to place an order.   The house salad dressing, which is a red wine vinaigrette, is really good and a favorite of mine.  Unfortunately, my salad had a hair in it.  I will give them the benefit of the doubt on that one.  After all, I guess it could have been mine.  Besides, there was no one around to tell about it anyway.  Since the wait took so long for the salad and beer, I figured I better get another beer in the works when my pizza arrived (or on the slim chance that my waitress came to check on me).  Well, that second beer arrived AFTER I ate my pizza.  I really didn't need it at that point.  Oh well.  As always, the pizza was good.  For whatever reason, the personal size seems lacking.  Perhaps, it is because you are immediately disappointed when it is eaten so quickly.  More than likely, it is because the recipe just wasn't designed for this size.  Do yourself a favor and get a small (or larger).  You will be happy you have leftovers.  Despite the fact that many describe the crust as buttery and they have something called Buttercrust, supposedly the deep dish dough does not actually contain dairy.  As such, the deep dish is vegan friendly, and I hope this is true, if you order your pizza sans cheese.  Doing just that on this visit, I opted for no cheese and hot giardiniera as a topping.  It is the perfect topping when in Chicago.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The butter crust in the deep dish was out of this world.

We were not sure how much pizza to order because we can typically devour a large thin crust pizza. So we figured 2 smalls would allow us to indulge while having the chance to get a couple different kinds. We opted for plain cheese deep dish and the Malnati classic pie. The classic was by far our favorite but the cheese was so good as well.<br><br>In the end, we did not finish the two smalls but we came pretty damn close. The result was us being extremely full until bedtime that evening (lol!) It was definitely all that cheese! It was layer upon layer of thick, warm, gooey cheese and I do not regret one bite regardless of how large my food baby was. <br><br>The service was quick, friendly, attentive, and honest. I say honest because they tell you that the pizza will take about 45 mins to cook (if you're ordering deep dish...and I don't know how you couldn't!) So, take that 45 minutes to drink a couple beers and build up the anticipation of great pizza to come. <br><br>I loved everything about that pizza. So thick and unlike any pizza I've ever tried before. I am so sad that I've waited so long to try this style pizza but I am so glad it was at a place that clearly is doing something right.

While I love a good slice of pizza, most pizza is some variation of dough, tomato sauce, and cheese. I tend to think that even the best pizza, is just pizza. <br><br>I went in on a Friday around 5pm. It was starting to get really busy, but I was able to avoid the lines and got seated at the bar. Bartenders were extremely friendly; they took the time to help a tourist like me decide which pizza to order (which I appreciate, I'm sure it gets annoying sometimes). Put it an order for a classic deep dish pizza, personal size. <br><br>I wasn't aware of the wait time and thought they had forgotten about my order until I checked in with the bartender who informed me that each pizza takes about 45 minutes. He told me this confidently, with absolutely no apologetic tone in his voice--which tells you that they believe it's worth the wait. <br><br>Typically, I'd think 45 minutes is a ridiculous wait time for pizza. Let me tell you, Lou Malnati's was worth the wait. The pizza was cheesy and saucy with the perfect cheese to meat ratio. ALSO, the crust was both crispy and soft, and coupled with the cheesiness and sauciness of the pizza ... OMG. Heaven in my mouth. I devoured my personal pizza. I swear I did not even look up from my place 'til I was finished. <br><br>My only gripe was that I had ordered a personal pizza...which was was there and gone in 2 minutes. I wanted more but did not want to wait another 45 minutes. I secretly hoped the couple next to me who ordered a full-size pizza (and had many slices left, let me tell ya) would offer me a slice. Haha! <br><br>Pls stop by this place if you're in the Chicago area! I saw a couple order their pizza to-go and eat it by the river walk, which I'd recommend as a cute lil' way to spend your afternoon :) <br><br>I still think pizza is pizza, but Lou Malnati's will probably be the best you've ever had :)", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "We had lunch today at Lou Malnati pizzeria .

I have to preface this by saying I'm not a fan of lots and lots of toppings on a pizza and I've never really had deep dish before - true deep dish but when in Chicago, you HAVE to try it and I was glad I did. Wow!  The pizza came out on a pie pan and they cut and serve you the first slice and I thought, the bottom of this crust must be so soggy cause look at all that liquid and grease but boy was I wrong.  Chicago deep dish is something else, especially here at Lou Malnati's.  The crust was crispy - we tried both the normal and the butter crust and couldn't really tell a difference.  The toppings were fantastic, especially when hot before the cheese congeals.  I love love loved the Malnati Chicago Classic - just the flavors of the cheese and meat was fantastic.  We also had to try the \"Lou\" while were were here and it was a little more soggy cause of the mushrooms and tomatoes and peppers but still good.  This was the vegetarian option and as good as it was, it couldn't beat the Malnati classic.  We ordered two smalls so we could try them both and it was more than enough for the 2 of us.  These babies are filling - so if they look small, it is very very deceiving.<br><br>I like that they pre-take your order and then seat you as seating becomes available and take your drinks and appetizer order then.  The pizza does take awhile to make so this shortens the wait a bit.  The line could be long but it was worth the wait - come on off times, around 3pm between lunch and dinner for a little shorter wait or during the week for no wait at all.  The restaurant was very classic Italian decor and style.  I'm drooling just writing this review and want to fly back to Chicago just for Lou Malnati's!!!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zI-2M6YY545tt6xrXImcTg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Back Dining area"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wViO2E-l7pNKG9IE-7RuOQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Interior Front Area"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Food was tasty, but unsure what the hype is about.

The sticks were pretty standard. Nothing to complain about. But the minestrone soup was out of this world. Easily the best I've ever had by miles. It says on the menu it takes two days to prepare. I can see why. Order this. You won't regret it.<br><br>Onward to the main course: the deep dish pizza. We ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic with their trademark Butter Crust. It comes with sausage and extra cheese by default. We added mushrooms and pepperoni.<br><br>First thing you need to know: the wait is a little long. Thirty to forty five minutes is standard. This is because they're making your pizza fresh, and that takes time. The wait staff is up front about this. It's no surprise. But if you're in a hurry, it's something you need to know.<br><br>That said, it's worth the wait. The pizza is dense with its ingredients. Everything is fresh and delicious. The sauce is savory with a hint of sweetness. The butter crust maintains its flavor and crunch. It's everything you'll ever want in a deep dish pizza.<br><br>They also make solid Bloody Marys. A little spicy by default, which I like. It's light on the garnishes, but classic Bloody Mary's usually are.<br><br>Lastly, price. It's pretty fair. With two Bloody Mary's, the soup, the cheese sticks, and the pizza, the price came to $40.00 before tip.<br><br>If you haven't been here, do yourself a favor and go.

The appetizer took 25 minutes and the pizza 45 minutes to be served. <br><br>Can I please say how the calamari appetizer is literally one of the best calamari I have ever had? When it was served on the table, I was not expecting much already because it looked too crispy and fried. But wow, the combination of the calamari with the house dipping sauce is AMAZING. The dipping sauce is not your typical tomato sauce. It's refreshing and it reminded me a little bit of a mignonette sauce used for raw oysters. <br><br>The deep dish itself was tasty too. I liked The Lou more than The Malnati Chicago Classic simply because I'm not a very meaty person. I also don't love to eat cheese... so the triple cheese on The Lou was a little much for me. The tomato sauce that Lou Malnati uses is homemade and so so delicious. If you read the description on their menu, their vine tomatoes are handpicked from California (or something like that). Note that they have suggested portion sizes and I advise you to listen to that. For two, a medium was WAY too big (my boyfriend claimed he could finish it). A small would have been perfect for us and maybe even a little bit leftover still. <br><br>The service was also phenomenal, even during the Saturday evening rush at the restaurant.

And Chicago has many pizzerias that serve their own twist of deep dish pizza. So... how do you choose the best deep dish pizza spot knowing that there's many others. If you're like me, you probably think \"whats the best spot\" , \"where's the best bang for the buck?\" , \"I don't want to waste my time\" , \"I don't want to be disappointed\" .... well I'll make it easy for you...<br><br>Go to Lou F'N Malnati's!!!!<br><br>As recommended by a few Chicago natives and locals, we went to see for ourselves if it was everything it was hyped out to be. On our first visit, we ordered the \"Chicago Classic\" - which basically is sausage, extra extra cheese, and their signature tomato sauce. And when i say sausage, I don't mean sausage as in carry out pizza sausage... you know, little turd pieces of sausage scattered across the whole pizza?.. well, no no no no no.. none of that here at Lou's. Here at Lou's, I mean sausage as in a whole freaking slab of sausage (lean sausage may I add) covering every square inch, every square centimeter on the pizza!! The \"Chicago Classic was so good, so meaty, so cheesy, and oooohhh the crust, Oh so buttery!! We also ordered \"The Lou\" which has some veggies on it such as spinach, tomatoes, and shrooms. That was good also but, hey I'm a meat kinda guy so I prefer the Classic Chicago!<br><br>Aside from the pizza, they also have real good appetizers. Some appetizers that we tried that is worth mentioning are: the calamari, chicken wings and mozzarella sticks.<br><br>On our last night in Chicago, we decided to do delivery out to our hotel, not knowing when we will get close or even get our hands on this authentic deep dish pizza again.  Being that I am a meat lover, ordered a custom combo, sausage and pepperoni. It was meaty delicious. <br><br>Recently, I found out that besides Chicago/ Illinois, there is only one other city/ state that has the pleasure of having a Lou Malnati's in the U.S. ... and that is Phoenix, AZ. Living in Las Vegas, I was ecstatic! It is about a 4-5 hour drive or I have the option on taking that hour flight. Will try to make it a point to visit at least every other month LoL Yes, all for this. Best pizza I've ever had! That's because I've yet been to NYC or Boston.

As fate would have it, an oncology conference brought me back to Chicago this weekend, and with it, an opportunity to sample another fan favorite. I decided to try Lou Malnati's because, among other reasons, my good friend from New York had spoken at length about the quality and taste, describing with such fervor how she abruptly awoke in the middle of the night many months after going in person, compelled by some otherworldly force to order a stifling quantity of Lou Malnati's frozen pizzas, not at all bothered by the shipping cost to NYC. Based on this review alone, I had to try it.<br><br>Unfortunately, I will not be describing any such experience with this sort of intensity. First, the pros - for a Friday night in Chicago, when both 40,000 oncology professionals were in town as well as countless others for a Taylor Swift concert, I was extremely pleased that our party of four only encountered a 15-minute wait. The decor was very authentic, warm, and inviting, and our waitress was very friendly and helpful. She happily split our bill four ways, even allowing us to separate out the alcohol on another check (we needed to do this for reimbursement purposes).<br><br>Next, the cons - at one point toward the end of our meal, a staff member who was moving chairs around slammed one into the back of my friend's chair. This gave her quite a jolt, and the staff member did not apologize or even seen to recognize what had happened. A minor issue, but still worth mentioning. The main talking point in this section is the food, I'm afraid. We ordered a large classic Lou Malnati's deep dish pizza, and it arrived only luke-warm. By the time we each had our second slice, the pie was cold. Even with the first slightly warm slice, though, I wasn't impressed. The dough was very greasy and the cheese was too tough, not the nice soft stringy texture I desired. The sauce was more of a diced-tomato topping, which was truthfully delicious on its own, but didn't seem cohesive with the rest of the dish and in fact easily slid off from the rest of the pizza, making it difficult to eat. There was far too much sausage for my liking (I think the entire pie was covered with a uniform layer), and again this caused everything to fall apart. The pizza was also extremely dense and left my stomach feeling a bit upset. Of course, much of what I've said is based on personal perference, and I completely respect those who prefer this over the manna from heaven that is served at Giordano's. <br><br>Overall, a quality pizza place that just didn't do it for me.

And boy am i glad!!! (I am also writing this review after having Giordano's the next day to compare fairly). We ordered the chicago original i think what its called - just cheese, sauce, sausage and of course on their butter crust that is to die for. It is the perfect balance of the ratios of cheese sauce and crust. We even said to each other that we didnt need to try anything else to know which was best. The small size was perfect for me and my boyfriend who definitely likes to eat. They also have great drinks as well. From the pictures and the \"cheese pull\" videos I've seen, Giordano's does look like it would be better than Lou's... but it definitely isnt!!! I cant wait to visit Chicago again to come back.

If you order a deep-dish pizza, be prepared for about a 45-minute wait. It takes a while for these pizzas to be prepared. The menu says the pizzas take 30 minutes, but our wait was closer to an hour.<br><br>I actually had my first Lou Malnati's deep-dish pizzas in Atlanta -- they were shipped to me as gifts through Lou Malnati's Tastes of Chicago (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/tastes-of-chicago-northbrook\">yelp.com/biz/tastes-of-c…</a>). I tried both a pepperoni and a sausage deep-dish pizza and they were delicious. The pizzas I had at home and the pizza I tried in the restaurant were very similar. I don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing considering how terrible I am in the kitchen (even with frozen food).<br><br>This Lou Malnati's is located in the River North neighborhood of Chicago. It's a little over a half-mile walk from the south end of The Magnificent Mile (about a 12-15 minute walk). I chose this place for our group for lunch because it had a 4-star rating on Yelp with about 3,000 reviews. I would consider this place touristy.<br><br>We showed up on a Monday around 2:30pm, hardly a peak time, and it was still busy. There's both indoor and covered outdoor seating. We were seated in the dining room in the back where there are booths and tables. They've tried to cram as many people in this space as (un)comfortably possible. It was such a tight fit that servers were constantly brushing up against us throughout the duration of our meal. When we first sat down, one of the servers accidentally painfully poked my friend in the arm with a pen. SMH.<br><br>The atmosphere is casual. The dining room has TVs playing sports and Chicago sports memorabilia (mainly jerseys) adorn the walls.<br><br>The restaurant sells both deep-dish and thin crust pizza. They come in four sizes from personal to large (serves 4). The standard pizzas have simple ingredients: cheese, sausage, and pepperoni. The cheese comes from Wisconsin, the sausage is local (not sure about the pepperoni), and the tomatoes come from California. They have a veggie deep-dish as well as their trademarked \"Buttercrust\" which you can add at an additional cost ($0.75 per pizza) plus over 10 additional enhancements/toppings if you so desire. In addition to pizza, they have appetizers like bruschetta and calamari; soups, salads, pastas, sandwiches, and desserts.<br><br>We went with the \"Malnati Chicago Classic,\" small size (serves 2) for $14.95. FYI, a personal runs $9.45 and a large runs $24.95. The Malnati Chicago Classic is made with sausage, extra cheese, tomato sauce, and Buttercrust. While the pizza was good, it didn't seem exceptional to me. I was actually expecting there to be even more cheese (out to the edge of the deep-dish pan) and I was expecting the crust and cheese to be burnt in places. Instead, the crust had hardly any char whatsoever and tasted rather plain. The Buttercrust was noticeably richer than plain dough though. Admittedly, I think I was expecting more of a cheesy caramelized crust like those served at Pequod's. Overall, I thought the quality of the pizza and its ingredients were fine.<br><br>Other items we ordered included a medium Caesar salad with grilled chicken for $8.75 and an order of the \"BuffaLou\" chicken wings for $8.95. They were alright too. The Caesar was made with Romaine lettuce, lean chicken strips, chopped tomato, shaved Parmesan cheese (a healthy amount), and crunchy croutons tossed in Caesar dressing. Six wings came to an order of the BuffaLou wings (on the apps menu) with celery and ranch dressing on the side. These were basically your standard buffalo wings that were slightly spicy.<br><br>The staff was friendly and welcoming.<br><br>If you've never had deep-dish pizza in Chicago before, Lou Malnati's is one of the classic places to get it. According to the menu, this location in River North is the oldest (established 1986) of its four city locations. Another place to consider is competitor Giordano's.

I came here with my boyfriend for his birthday after our original reservations at a different restaurant had fallen through. Once we arrived, we were told it would be about an hour wait which I totally expect. It's what you have to deal with when you go to a popular restaurant, especially one that doesn't take reservations. We pre-ordered our pizza and decided to go with a medium classic. After about an hour, we got a text that our table was ready and headed upstairs. <br><br>At this point, I was expecting our pizza to come out pretty soon - after all, we had ordered in advance. However, this was not the case. After already waiting an hour, we then had to wait another hour to get our pizza. What's the point of pre-ordering then? I feel like they may have messed up our order, because I saw another table get their pizza relatively quickly after they sat down. Our server was very inattentive, and this just made the wait so much more annoying. He would serve the tables next to us and then just ignore us. He never checked up on us or gave us updates about how long the pizza would take. <br><br>About the pizza itself, I was not impressed either. I've had Giordano's and Pizano's before, and I enjoyed both of them so I was expecting this one to be even better. But this pizza was just so average in comparison. First, it was lukewarm when it came out. Second, it didn't even look that thick. The flavor was fine, but it was nothing special. <br><br>Overall, I will not be returning.

There was a wait even this later in the day. We waited 22 minutes for a table, which wasn't too bad. While we waited, an employee told us that we could actually put in an order for our pizza so that it will be ready by the time we are seated (you can only put in your order for pizza only, which is great because it does take some time for it to be made). <br><br>So 22 minutes later, we were seated with menus in hand and ended up ordering:<br><br>Spinach Salad, $9.25 prior to tax- I asked for the dressing (balsamic dressing) to be on the side, which is how it came. This salad was a good size for 2 people to share and came with thinly sliced pears (added a nice sweet taste), some crumbled goat cheese and sliced red onions. I thought this salad was good, but would have preferred grilled onions. <br><br>The Malnati Chicago Classic, Small Size, $14.95 prior to tax- If you come to Lou Malnati's, you have to get the Chicago classic. This deep dish masterpiece is topped with sausage, roma tomato marinara and extra cheese. Toppings are simple, but so perfect together(but you can add extra toppings at an additional cost if you want more). The small size gives you 4 large pieces (our server cut and served the pizza for us) and honestly could probably feed 3 people (you only need to eat one slice because it is really filling). The cheese is so oozey and wished I had more it. This is a must order!<br><br>Chocolate Chip Pizza, Individual Serving, $3.35 prior to tax- Not that I had much room for dessert, but I still wanted something sweet to end this meal. So my husband and I opted to share an individual serving. This serving really is perfect for 1 person (or 2 full people). The cookie and ice cream was a good match and would love to order the larger serving ($6.65 prior to tax, serves 2-3 people). By the way, if you want to order this dessert, let your server know ahead of time because it does take some time to make. <br>---------------------------<br>(Total= $29.75 after tax, prior to tip)<br><br>Wow this meal was delicious!<br><br>Even though a local Chicagoan (whom I met on the plane on my way back to Southern California) told me that Lou Malnati's is just \"decent\", I still think this place is pretty good.

We were between Pequod's or Lou Malnati's, but Pequods had a two hour wait just for a table AND you had to wait an extra 90 minutes for the pizza to cook. We were starving, so that was a no go. Lou Malnati's was our next best bet. We arrived at 7pm on a Sunday and they text you whenever your table is ready. You can also check on your number in line so you can walk around while waiting for your table. It is very crowded inside, so I recommend walking around even though it was freezing cold outside and nothing was really open. Another advantage is being able to order your pizza beforehand. Since it does take 90 minutes to cook, you don't have to wait for your table to order and for your pizza to cook! We waited about 30 mins for a table for four. Not too shabby. We ordered the Malnati salad and the combination platter for an appetizer. Holy malnati, the salad was soo good. My mom could not stop talking about the dressing. They need to release that dressing recipe because it tasted like crack. The combination platter has a bunch of fried stuff, like fried zucchini and mushrooms. Pretty good, but anything fried is good. Our pizza took about 25ish more minutes to come out, and they slice and plate it in front of you. We ordered the classic and added pepperoni and mushrooms (it comes with sausage). My favorite part was the crust, it wasn't soggy despite all of the sauce and cheese on there. I got full off of one slice. Everyone thought it was good, but Chicago pizza just isn't my style.

All of us had our carry-on luggage. We asked for a table for 6, and they took a minute to seat us. The staff decided to seat us upstairs- keep in mind there were clear tables on the ground level- so we all had to carry our bags up to their second floor. Our table wasn't yet ready, so we waited near another table that was set up for 7, and asked if it would be ok if we sat there. The waitress said no, and explained that the table was set up for 9, despite only seeing 7 place settings... and proceeded to seat us at a table in the far back, by a service door, and next to a large group on a food tour. <br><br>Waiter took a while to come over, I'm guessing because we were sat so far back in a corner. Assuming this was because we had luggage. He took our order and left. <br><br>During the first interaction with our waiter, we explained that we had one dairy allergy at the table. No, this is not someone who decided to cut out dairy, go vegan, whatever. She has a severe allergy to dairy (different to being lactose-intolerant). We explained this to our waiter. Normally at other restaurants when we explain her dairy allergy to our wait staff, they respond quite attentively. This waiter seemed to brush off our statement, and carried on taking the order. <br><br>We ordered a few appetizers to share, and our friend with a dairy allergy ordered the bruschetta, again asking for her order with no dairy. <br><br>Our first appetizers came, we ordered the chicken wings and calamari. Upon asking the man who was refilling our water if the chicken wings had dairy, he said he didn't know. We had to ask him to check for us, or find our waiter. He never returned to our table with an answer. <br><br>Our waiter returned to our table for something unrelated, and we asked the same question: Do the chicken wings contain dairy? He said he didn't know, and we had to prompt him to return to the kitchen to find out. <br><br>About 10 minutes later, he returns to assure us that the chicken wings didn't have dairy in the breading. My friend proceeds to eat one of the wings. <br><br>About another 10 minutes passes, ironically while she was telling our group of another time at a restaurant they had messed up her order and the aftermath of that day. We then see the manager and our waiter approaching our table. The manager asks \"did you eat the chicken wings?\" We all knew where this was going and were SHOCKED. We even asked if he was joking. The manager let us know that the wings did in fact contain dairy, AFTER she had already eaten the wing. <br><br>It is shocking to me that a restaurant chain would be so dismissive and rude about a dairy allergy. Every staff member we interacted with were unprofessional and dismissive, and we were absolutely not impressed. They offered us a gift card (we gave it away because we don't live in Chicago) and offered to comp our meal. <br><br>The manager and waiter offered their apologies, but we left before finishing our food. I would never recommend this place again, especially to those who have sensitivities to food of any kind. I understand these kinds of this can happen, the reason for my review is the combination of lack of knowledge of the menu and attitude the wait staff took with our group when we inquired about whether or not the appetizer contained dairy. <br><br>Food was average, but will never return to be talked to or treated that way again! It's a shame because the restaurant on N State St (we were on Wells St) did not share this terrible service.<br><br>*side note- as we were leaving, the table we asked to be seated at in the first place (the one the waitress told us was used for groups of 9) had a group of 6 seated. <br><br><a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2FShowUserReviews-g35805-d427793-r518443139-Lou_Malnati_s_Pizzeria-Chicago_Illinois.html&s=5302126fdbb90e2598f0338c7cf395a12ade9c65bfd190f4cde7eb2699a5506f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tripadvisor.com/ShowUser…</a>", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "It's my first time in Chicago and I was really excited to have an authentic Chicago deep dish pizza.

To order other food that's not pizza, you have to be seated.<br><br>Once seated we waited about 40 minutes or it seemed longer than that for wings to come out. The wings were really good and thick, plenty of meat and sauce, but it's weird how they came with no carrots and only had celery. <br>I loved the wings better than their pizza!<br><br>Chicago style deep dish pizza was good but not amazing. The crust was crunchy but hard to cut through since they suggest you eat it with a fork and knife. I like eating pizza with my hand and cheese to be melted or fully cooked but this one was not. The cheese was stretchy and doughy not done baking? The pepperoni was weak on flavor and not many toppings. I'm just really surprised or not use to this type of pizza. I ordered half Lou and half Malnati and they almost tasted identical. Everything was excess cheese which is too much for me but that's not bad. I was expecting the pizza to be thicker and deeper as I've seen on television and YouTube research. The pizza arriving to the table was another hour wait after my appetizer of wings came which is horrible wait time for a small order of pizza!! The waitress even said \"your pizza will be out in 2 minutes\", liar. I'm just being nice with 3 stars because I really liked the wings.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/y2yggiYyUhOIkPOy3RPbTA/168s.jpg", "caption": "The wings are good!"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Vkp0oJez8A-fafokGOB5jQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Half Lou, Half Malnati is what I ordered Chicago deep dish style"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Great pizza!

Very patriotic with their sports team memorabilia decorating the walls. The staff is great: super friendly and attentive.<br><br>The chain restaurant of Lou Malnati's has traditional dishes you'd normally find at an Italian restaurant - with the exception of the pizza. We ordered the fried calamari as an appetizer and the chicken pasta and cheese deep dish pizza for our entree. All enough to share between four people and have some leftovers. The calamari was good - not greasy or overly cooked to the point of overly chewy, just the right amount of chew and crunch. They came with a cocktail dipping sauce. The chicken marsala pasta was delicious: rigatoni pasta covered in a creamy, white sauce mixed in with chunks of chicken breast and mushrooms and topped with shavings of parmesan and slivers of basil. It felt homemade, which is what made it better. The pizza is allotted a certain amount of cooking time which it tells you on the menu, so hopefully you're not in a rush. Either way, it's worth the wait. We ordered the large pizza and only six out of the eight slices. They're thick slices of pizza. Crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside with a hefty amount of cheese and sauce; you'll be happy you waited thirty minutes. Their dessert menu did look enticing, but we were so full from dinner that we could not fathom eating a chocolate chip pizza or tiramisu.

And I never forgot the name and what a cool one, Lou Malnati. Sounds like a gangster's name. But in this case, the gangster of Chicago deep dish pizza. Being that I live in NYC, I have so many pizza spots to choose from. $1 pizza, my favorite pizza place, vegan pizza, neopolitan, the classics(Joe's, Ray's, Artichokes, Bleeker etc..)pizza chains--and this is just a small fraction. I came to Chicago with my nose-to-the-sky knowledge on pizza and was ready for what Lou had to offer. I was sat at the bar as soon as I arrived, 935pm. I had intended for the restaurant to be mobbed, but as far as I can see there was enough space on the floor to perform The Nutcracker. I'm just glad that I don't have to wait for seating or have to sit outside--has been humid lately. An expressionless bartender asked me if I wanted to start on a drink. Nope, just a Coke. I had already skimmed the menu and knew I wanted to start on the mozz. sticks. 10 seconds later, I said I might as well put in my pizza order. And he said, might as well, it DOES take 40 minutes. But he said it like a jerk would say it. Like if common sense should have taught me this. I immediately developed a bad taste in my mouth. I couldn't let the bartender in his lonely island take away from the hype. He did mention getting the butter crust and I was later glad I did. You see, optimism. My 7 sticks came out about 10 minutes after ordering. They were gone just about as soon as they were presented to me. I like them hotter(temp) than served and the tomato sauce accompaniment was nice and chunky. And not 40 minutes, but in 25 minutes  my personal deep dish pizza with pepperoni came out. Given to me briskly and with no eye contact. It was an interesting wait though. Got to see the staff do a lot of dancing, and dancing with whipped cream in their mouth, and play patty cake, and dance some more, and the bartender likes sandsurfing--I overheard. BUT THAT PIZZA!!! Boy, was that a delicious circular and singular sensation. I felt weird having to use a fork and knife coming from the land of slices. But I got a personal so I was able to still use my paws. I asked the bartender to go light on sauce as well. Yummy, and buttery and a taste that was so satisfying and that lingered. Each bite had the promise of a happy ending on my palette. Boy, was that a great piece of doughy heaven with poking pieces of pepperoni. I wasn't savvy on the pan sizes until after I ordered. But I think I could have easily took down the next size(for 2). I know I will be back. Maybe at this location, or maybe at another. I need to experience the greatness of this pizza once or twice again.

If there's a wait when you're there, just go ahead and place your order as you wait for your table since it takes awhile to bake.)<br><br>We decided to order the Malnati Chicago Classic deep dish pizza with Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust.

The waitress said it was due to the size and because they wanted to make sure the sausage was cooked thoroughly. Now, the sausage is not the usual small pieces you get at your regular pizza places but large, slices of sausage. I'm not usually a fan of sausage, but their blend of sausage and seasoning sure makes this kind pretty tasty. You really do get your bang for your buck here. <br><br>I've had deep dish pizza before in California but this was amazing. The crust was delicious and the toppings were so fresh and flavorful. BUT, you really can start getting full after a slice... and we made the mistake of ordering a large. We should have opted for a medium pizza that was meant for 3 people. While we were so full from 2 slices, we were determined to finish the pizza... this came at a price though. We probably didn't want to see another pizza for awhile after stuffing ourselves with this pizza. <br><br>Lou Malnati's does offer other options besides pizza on their menu, but why come if you're not going to have the pizza?

I thought it was just alright, but I felt obligated to give deep dish another try since I'm back in Chicago. We came in on Wednesday night around 9 pm and we were quoted for a 30 minute wait. Since we were rather tired after a long day of sightseeing plus all the positive reviews on Yelp, we decided we would just wait here than go to a different place. <br>We put in our order while we were waiting to be seated. It is recommended to do so because it takes a while to bake the deep dish pizzas. We ended up ordering two personal size pizza to share - the Lou and the Malanti. We also got a house salad to share.<br><br>We actually got seated in about 15 minutes rather than half an hour. Our salad came first. I ordered it with dressing on the side, but when the salad came the dressing was no where to be seen. We were sitting in the corer by the window so it was hard to flag down a waiter to get dressing. However once we got to our waiter, he brought us the dressing soon after. Even though we preordered the pizza, we still waited for a some time for them. It's just the nature of the dish, so I would definitely recommend preordering the pizza.<br><br>Neither my sister nor I are fan of deep dish pizza after our meal. We definitely prefer thin crust. I never thought I would say no to extra bread. However, the pizza crust isn't very flavorful, so the extra crust makes the pizza rather bland. To me the cheese, sauce, crust ratio is off for deep dish pizza. Too much dough!!

We went here on a Wednesday night around 6pm, so it wasn't too crowded. However, around 7pm, all the booths and tables were filled, so try to get here early if you can. The booths are extremely comfortable and the service at Lou Malnati's is quite good because the waiters are attentive and even slice the deep dish pizza for you. The GF and I ordered a medium sized Malnati Chicago Classic and the chocolate chip pizza for dessert. In regards to the deep dish pizza, the Malnati Chicago Classic was amazing, it came loaded with sausage and the crust was out of this world. The cheese was well melted and extremely flavorful. Initially, the medium size pizza looked too small for us, but after consuming that beast, it was a total hunger buster! My only complaint about the deep dish pizza at Lou Malanti's is that it is a bit oily (also the 30 minute wait for the pizza to be freshly prepared), but other than that this deep dish pizza was out of this world and I would come back to Chicago just to eat here again. Lastly, the dessert was also pretty good, we got the larger portion of the chocolate chip pizza and it was loaded with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. I would tell them to go easy on the whipped cream because it was an overload. However, the chocolate chip portion was warm and soft, which complemented the ice cream very well. Overall, I highly recommend trying Lou Malnati's if you want some high quality deep dish pizza at an affordable price.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LHCGotC7lX62sdkfvzZ9_Q/168s.jpg", "caption": "Medium size Malnati Chicago Classic.

The chicken marsala was brought to our friend (the husband) long before the rest of us received our food. In fact, our friend finished the chicken marsala way before we received our food. Approximately 20 - 25 minutes after he got his meal, we got our food. Several of us had asked the waiter why he would bring out the marsala way before the rest of the food. His response? \"The pizza takes longer to make.\" He also said he didn't realize we all wanted to eat together. SERIOUSLY!! We asked him several times to check on the pizzas. Each time he said he would but he never came back to the table to tell us the status- not once!! He never refilled our waters.

I went ahead and placed the same exact order I thought I had previously placed online. A few days later I received confirmation that my order had shipped. I anxiously awaited it. A few days later I received the order, but then realized I had not received the complimentary cheesecakes that I was supposed to receive for ordering so many pies.

Each order was over $280. So, I called Lou Malnati's again, and they told me that I should only be charged once because they only had one order for me and that it was probably just my bank. I waited to see if it was a bank error and would clear. Sure enough, the charges were removed the next day. The following day I received the order of what I thought would be just the cheesecakes. My bank account was once again showing cleared transactions for TWO orders. What I received was a whole other order of the same stuff plus the cheesecakes. I contacted Lou Malnatis AGAIN, spoke to the SAME representative AGAIN, and she told me that nothing could be done.  She said that because the order shipped that I had to pay for them. I couldn't ship them back because they would spoil. I explained that I had spoken to her several times before and that she was the one that told me she didn't have the first order from me, which is why I placed the second order over the phone.

Their menu is extensive but my play was the obvious: I am here for the Pizza and Pizza only. <br><br>The \"Lou\" was what I opted for, a whimsical affair featuring spinach mix, mushrooms and sliced roma tomatoes covered with blended Mozzarella, Romano and Cheddar cheeses on a thick, yet flaky garlic \"Buttercrust\". This Pizza is very good. No, scratch that... it is excellent. A perfect cheese to tomato ratio and the crust is doughy in the inside but does not overwhelm the other flavors. The meats follow through in the finish along with a hard hit of Garlic. One piece had me feeling pretty full but I went all in on a second slice since we simply do not have pies like these out west and I walked out feeling like the Michelin man. <br><br>The small will feed two at $16.00 and is a great value in my mind.

The depth of the pizza was mostly cheese. The cheese was the best part... stringy, gooey, excellent cheese. The crust wasn't as thick as you would think, nor was it at all doughy, as some deep dish pizzas are. My husband and daughter split the specialty Malnati Chicago Classic, made with Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust. I tried their pizza, which came with sausage slices. I actually liked their sausage pizza more than my pepperoni pizza, but I didn't taste the butter on the crust. The crust was my least favorite part. We all sort of picked around the crust. My second least favorite part, was the sauce. I wasn't a fan of the chunky sauce, but my daughter fell in love.

I don't know what it was when we went.. If it was too busy, they were understaffed, or for some reason that escapes me, but our experience was less than par that left a sour taste in my mouth. The wait was expected, but what wasnt was the seating of multiple 4 tops before my party even though we clearly put our name down first. It was only until I went inside and ask the hostess about it was when we finally got a table. Maybe it was really coincidental that our table just came up when I decided to ask, who knows. <br><br>Next our server took an exceedingly long time to take our order. Now my qualm is not with her service, but the speed of the service. She herself was extremely nice and helpful, but it seemed that she was second guessing and taking her sweet time despite the rush. We put our order in before we were seated per request of the hostess in the beginning, and was told by our server that it would take 15 minutes to come out. IT TOOK AN HOUR. Tables around us got theirs before us, and to top it off, it was WARM. It was cooled to the point that I was able to pick up the metal pan with my bare hand and the inside most of the pizza was cold. They reheated it for us and gave us a free dessert, but by no means did it compensate for the time we lost waiting for a table and our pizza. We didn't account for the extra hour that we lost instead of exploring Chicago's secrets. <br><br>Maybe our experience was a bad one, and I hope no one else has to wait that long for anything here.

However, it was a little tougher this time for me and my other friend that was with me the first time around. While the sauce is robust, spicy and more flavorful than Lou's, Giordanos delievered an abundance of cheese (layered to perfection) with thinly sliced pepperoni... but the crust was a little bit more dry and mealy than I remember.  On the other hand, Lou's had the most incredible buttery, flaky crust. It was absolutely delicious. I do NOT remember the pizza being so good last time. It could have been that we ordered in last time and maybe this type of pizza is better served hot, and fresh. While Lou's doesn't serve up a crazy amount of cheese like Giordano's, nor is the sauce as robust,  it's still superb! The sausage was also fantastic here (I normally don't order sausage on pizza but we ordered \"the classic\")  it was thinly sliced and layered so precisely with every other layer including cheese, and pepperoni. Omg it was delicious! <br>So I've come to stand still, to which family owned Pizzeria serves up the best deep dish. Both are fantastic and both are affordable as a family of 4 can fill up on a medium pie. While the prices may seem steep ($20-$30) you can, and probably will be, stuffed with 1 slice.

I gave them my name and was told it would be in approximately 30 minute wait for a table or I could just sit at the bar. They also recommended placing the order for my pizza ahead of time since the pies generally take around 30 minutes to prepare. They have a chart on the wall near where you check in illustrating the sizes of the different size options  ranging from personal to extra-large. I was famished and was concerned the \"small\" size (one step up from personal) would not be sufficient to satisfy my appetite. The lady at the check in desk was correct, the \"small\" sized \"Malnati Chicago Classic\" (  Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust) pie shut me down like a pile of bricks.  <br><br>As you can see in the photograph I made it about halfway through slice 4/4 and that was it for me. Perhaps I should not have ordered minestrone soup, without it I may have made it through my iPod.

I'm giving this 4 stars but not because it was really good pizza.  It was good...something...but we really need to come up with a different word for what this is.  It might be in the pizza order, but it is not the same species as pizza.  That said, because we don't have a word for it yet, I will call it pizza.  But it isn't pizza.<br><br>I don't get it Chicago, I really don't.  There isn't a comparison to be made between NY pizza (or, just pizza, for short) and Chicago deep dish.  How do you compare the two?  How can you possibly say one is better than the other?  It's like saying chocolate is better than football or unicorns are better than rainbows.  It's not comparable.<br><br>Let me get on to the \"pizza\" for a moment - it is 4 star worthy food.  I would probably go 3.5 if I could, but I can't, and its definitely better than a 3.  Heck, it better be since this is the go-to for Chicago pizza...depending on who you ask.  Apparently, you can ask 20 people in Chicago for the best pizza and get 20 different answers, but that's not much different from NY.  Anyway, I got the Lou, or something like that.  It's their signature deep dish pizza with butter crust and a flavorful tomato sauce and cheese.  It's basically what you would expect a deep dish pizza to be, though I am not sure I would go with the butter crust again.  It was good, but a bit too heavy on the buttery goodness.<br><br>My girlfriend and I sat on the patio and the service was good out there, though we failed to read anything that would have warned us the food takes 35-40 minutes or else we would have planned our day better and not gotten so annoyed by the wait.  Once the food came, I will admit I devoured it.  Again, it's not that it wasn't good, it's just that you walk in expecting to be floored and really struggle with the idea of NY v. Chicago pizza.  There is no struggle, there is no contest.<br><br>So, again, its good, but its not pizza.  This is what you get if your pizza was bloated, or perhaps if your pizza was allergic to bees and got stung, or nuts and was served with sausage cooked in peanut oil.  It deserves its own name and its own category.  But please, for the love of all that is good and holy in the world, stop calling it pizza and stop comparing it to NY.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Delicious pizza!!

And man I do have some mixed opinions on this. Again, in accordance with my deep dish factorial analysis, I gotta judge it based on the crust, sauce, cheese + toppings, and ratios. How do we break this down?<br><br>Crust: Lou Malnati's takes on a close second to Giordano's for sure, but barring anything else they are both essentially equal. Flaky and crispy butter crust, never burnt. I will knock on the fact that typically because Lou's and Gino's has smaller pizzas than Giordano's, the ratio of dough to ingredients seems to be greater. Still crispy and delicious though.<br><br>Sauce: I actually prefer the flavor of the sauce at Lou's compared to Giordano's, but much prefer the consistency of Giordano's(which just seems fresher with larger chunks of tomato). The sauce at Lou's is a bit sweeter while still being spiced similarly(I'm a fan), but for the most part seemed like a paste rather than a more natural and made-to-order tomato sauce.<br><br>We ordered two large pizzas, the Lou(Spinach mix, fresh tomatoes, 3 cheeses), and the Chicago classic(Sausage, extra cheese). Here is where I have mixed opinions. Despite the lack of meat, the Lou is probably one of my favorite deep dish pizzas in Chicago. The extra tomatoes and the fresh spinach mix really just makes it all taste vibrant, and the cheese with the sauce really just brings it all together in an oozing fatty mess of deliciousness. The Chicago Classic on the other hand....the plate of sausage was nice but I think I prefer the sausage at Giordano's(Lou's was about equal to Gino's in that respect). However the ratios of the Chicago classic were a bit off for my tastes: far too much cheese and crust and not enough sauce. In the end I sort of just wanted an extra side of sauce just so I could dip the extra cheesy bread.<br><br>Overall verdict: Lou's can make some good pizza, and the namesake is there for a reason. As for the Chicago classic, if you want a meat based pizza I'd stick with just a regular pepperoni or sausage deep dish because the ratios will be a bit more favorable.

My oh my, was I surprised to see just how much a small pizza was and how filling it was! The crust was flaky and the sausage was a perfect complement to the pizza, though the oil on the pizza was a bit much at times. Fork and knife definitely needed! The staff's recommendations were spot on and their pizza was something that allowed me to taste something unique to Chicago. I enjoyed the food overall and the service was great.

During both of my trips, I tried various other deep dish pizzas (Giordano's, Gino's, Pizzeria Uno), and I have to admit that Lou Malnati's has my favorite all-around deep dish pizza. They win be over with their delicious Buttercrust and perfect combination of cheese, sausage, and tomato sauce in their Malnati Chicago Classic deep dish pizza. Their trio of dips and pizza chips is a great starter if you're into hummus and artichoke-type dips. <br><br>I can't finish a meal without having dessert, so their Chocolate Chip Pizza was a perfect ending to my experience. Warm, fresh baked cookie topped with vanilla ice cream and a ton of whipped cream.
