I'm not quite sure how to classify their pizza, though. It's definitely thin crust, but not New York or even Chicago Tavern thin. Kind of had more of a coal-fired crust taste, though it wasn't as charred or puffed up as that. So yeah... I guess it's some kind of thin crust.<br><br>What stood out for me was that the pizza sauce was strong and BOOM! Impactful. It has a great tangy taste to it. It was my first time here and so I've only tried the traditional red pizza style - they do also have a white pizza and a bespoke tomato style.<br><br>The place as you'd expect was packed at 8pm on a Saturday. We got pretty lucky and walked into bar seating as soon as we got there. We ordered some salad and artichoke dip while we were up there. The Cesar salad didn't quite have the tang, which you'd expect with Cesar dressing. The dip was pretty much a cheese sauce and you'd be hard pressed to find or taste artichoke in it. Not to say it didn't taste good - what's not to like about a cheesy gooey dip. But just know what to expect, actually, what not to. Then we didn't order the pizza until we got the table.<br><br>Oh, in one strange thing... The pizza tray is HUGE and our table was tiny, so even with one of those elevated tray racks in place, it was kind of awkward space once the pizza arrived. Imagine the entire table top and beyond we're covered by a big metal tray 1.5\" feet above the table you're sitting at. So our plates, silverware, etc are like under the tray and you kind of have to reach under there to eat. Hehe... Not sure if that description makes sense, but it was not ideal. That's something they should reconsider for small tables; maybe place the pizza next to your table on one of those temp stands, or something like that.<br><br>Just the pizza itself was awesome and I need to figure out if they deliver down to the West Loop.

It's not cut into little dinky squares. It doesn't have the toppings buried under the cheese. <br><br>I like that the pizzas aren't shaped in a perfect circle. They're more like oblong ovals that are cut into randomly sized triangular slices. The crust has a great crispness on it with just a tiny hint of chew.

I don't know what they do with these mushrooms but they are packed with flavor. And the chicken doesn't dry out, which is always a risk when it's on a pizza. <br><br>But then there's what I call the New Haven special. The white pizza, with no sauce, topped with mozzarella, bacon, clams, and roasted peppers. At first thought, this might seem like a crazy combination. But the combination of bacon and roasted peppers provides that perfect combination of sweet and salty. They load the pizza up with clams, they definitely don't skimp on them either.

A little lemon, and plenty of Parmesan and crushed red pepper, and I'm ready to go.<br><br>The small pizza is supposed to feed 1-2 people, but I have no problem taking one of these down by myself.

It was good, I just wouldn't say it was great.<br><br>In addition to pizza and other edible offerings, they have in-house brewed libations of the craft beer variety. Their beers are \"award winning\" in fact and I put it in quotes because they are really proud of their awards which they adorn much of their walls with...almost to an obnoxious degree. Like the pizzas, I found the beers good, but nothing I personally would consider to be amazing.<br><br>I did like the atmosphere and our server was really nice.

So I went to Piece last Saturday with my sister and boyfriend and we had the worst experience. The waiter already sucked bring everything extremely late. My sister had to leave because everything was taking to long so she order a pizza to go. When the pizza arrived she decided to add on a carrot cake. After 15min she asked the waiter how much longer do you think it's going to take? And with an EXTREMELY RUDE attitude  he's said \"the carrot cake will be out when it's out\" I try to keep calm and was about to ask for the bill but he just stormed off saying things under his breath. 5 minutes later he brought the bill and my sister was waiting by the register to pay I went over because i heard he was talking super rude to my sister and told him calm down you don't have to give attitude she's asking a simple question, why are you being so rude?  He SHOUTED  I'm not doing anything here's the bill!!! At that point I had enough I yell back at him to be quiet and don't talk to me like that! He continued to argue and I just said I want to talk to the manager and he stormed off yelling okay manager manager! The manager came over and try to  sort things out he ask if he can do anything for us but at that point I was extremely angry and i just said i want to leave! I was so angry because I couldn't believe that this guy yelled at me! come on why am I spending money at this place to have some guy yelled at me because he's having a bad day!  Some people are just not meant to work with the public but if you hate your job that is not my fault. As we were leaving the manager came back and again asked if he can do anything for us, I said can you return the purchase because unfortunately we had already paid for this HORRIBLE experience! He said he returned the purchase, but it's been 5 days since and I STILL have the charges in my account! I hope I don't have to call back and add more discomfort to this already HORRENDOUS experience. At the end it's extremely shitty to go out and have your night ruin by a waiter at one of your favorite places! Also although the manager was extremely nice the waiter never even apologize for yelling at me!  Who does that? I have never seen a case of a waiter yelling at a customer! THIS RUINED MY NIGHT! I wish i caught his name so I can write it in this review. I use to recommend Piece to everyone but now I honestly just say STAY AWAY!  I  don't know how this guy even works there!

When they are first served on the giant rectangular trays, the pizzas were so hot that the toppings slid cleanly off when one tried to slip out a piece onto a plate, so I would wait a few moments for the pies to cool for enhanced structural integrity, if you can exercise the self-restraint.

Candied nuts, cranberries, a ridiculously good dressing and fresh crisp greens.<br><br>Cesar salad: a classic, but done right. Even comes with anchovies, making for a salty, traditional delight.<br><br>Pizza: we got two and had ample leftovers. One was a classic pie with red sauce, sausage and pepperoni. It was a cheesy, gooey wonder, not too much sauce, not too thin a crust. Perfect. We also got the Honey Butter Fried Chicken pizza. I was skeptical because the ingredient list was zany and I usually can't handle any kind of spice, but this was great. A little zip from the hot sauce but not intolerable, crispy fried chicken, my only complaint about this white pizza adventure is that it was heavy on the garlic - full of flavor, but a smidge overpowering.<br><br>Dessert: we pressed on through that feast and ordered a dessert pizza, oozing with chocolate, hazelnut, and creamy mascarpone cheese, this was devoured in minutes. The lightness of the crust and the freshness of the mascarpone brought an overall lightness to what should have felt like a chocolate brick in our overstuffed bellies.<br><br>All of this plus five or six beers was just over $100, which, while not your standard carry out pizza joint prices, is really not at all terrible for the mountains of food we enjoyed.

Although traditional New Haven style has no cheese, only sauce and toppings, I can't go without cheese! I'm a vegetarian so I like getting a variety of veggies on my pizza. However, beware, this is east coast pizza so it is thin, unlike Chicago pizza. I wouldn't get any more than three toppings on a Piece pizza, otherwise the crust won't be able to hold it all. Literally all of the appetizers, salads, and beers here are also great. Regarding the latter, I recommend getting a flight. Next door is Bro Bagel, which is owned by the same people.

However, the place was far from empty. <br><br>I've ordered a white pizza both times I've been here. You can get a red pizza with sauce and cheese, a classic with sauce and garlic, or a white pizza with olive oil and garlic.

We opted for the medium size pizza, which serves 2-3 people. The pizza came out after an appropriate time and it was really good. Piece definitely earns my vote for one of the best thin crust pizzas in Chicago. The crust is hand-pressed to perfection, not overly crackery thin with bumps that give me goosebumps. Yum! The olive oil, garlic, onion, cheese combo is a total winner and even though I haven't tried a pizza with sauce here yet, I'll be tempted to get the same tried and true combination again next time.<br><br>The only hiccup in my experience was the service. We were seated right away, but then we didn't get waters for ~10 minutes.

Just enough time to grab a beer and hang out at the bar actually.

I wanted bacon on it, too, but my friends told me to relax on all the meat. The pizzas came out steaming hot and I enjoyed them both greatly. The crust was flaky and buttery and all the toppings were fresh & tasty. The garlic in the white pizza definitely came through. The tables are not very big and they bring the pizzas out on huge trays so there is no room for anything else on the table. You have to kind of tip toe your booty up so you can talk to your table mates, otherwise your face is covered by the massive pizza trays. <br><br>I basically begged my friends to finish our meal with the chocolate pizza. Yea, we were all full but chocolate pizza?!?!?! Come on! It was so indulgent and we couldn't kill much of it but I liked it. I don't think it's something I'd ever get again just because of the sheer size of it, but it was S'mores-tacular! <br><br>Beerwise - the Dark & Curvy is where it's at. You can get small 3 ozs. sizes of the beer for just $1 each!

(5/5) - brew their own beer, also has non-beer like drinks for us non beer drinkers!<br>atmosphere. (5/5)  - cool space in hipster town (aka wicker park)<br><br>this place came highly recommended by a friend, basically a chicago-native, and yelp, so i decided to give this place a try (even though me and my friends were dying for something healthy from eating everything in site on this chicago trip).. but OH BOY we were NOT disappointed! <br><br>Things to get: PIZZA. specifically, i recommend the lunch special. unless you're here with a group of people (group = 4 or more people) because the pizzas we saw come out for our neighbors were GINORMOUS. <br>the tricks to ordering the individual lunch pizzas are 2: <br>1. you can order any topping from the first page on your lunch pizza! so its not just limited to whats under the lunch pizza topping portion. HINT: get the hot doug's sausage. SO GOOD. for those of you that dont know what hot doug's is, its a famous hot dog shop that closed down unfortunately last year but i guess his sausage's are still in tact! <br>2. you get 3 toppings max, and the price increases by $1 each time you add on a topping. it starts off at $7.95.<br><br>theres nothing much else to say about the pizzas because i want you to try them. they're SO GOOD. like, legit. ny style. crunchy. delicious. hot. steaming. marina-y. cheesy. full of toppings, delicious, pizzas. yes the toppings are expensive BUT they give you your monies worth. i would say the individual pizzas are a good sized portion for one person (if you are not a hungry boy). <br><br>APPS: we actually ordered the GOAT CHEESE marina sauce dip app. OMGASM. if you're looking for an app to share with friends, DEFINITELY get this one. the bowl of marinara goat cheese is ALOT, and the bread toast that comes out is unlimited-refilled by your waiter, so i definitely recommend that. (I hate it when they only give you enough chips/bread for your order and charge u extra for another round) <br><br>drinks: it was february, they didnt have the camel toe that yelp raved so much about. :( so i ordered the GRAPEFRUIT BEER. i asked the lady if there was any beer taste to it (I hate beer) and she said no, and hence thats why i ordered it. unfortunately for me, im very sensitive so i actually could taste the beer tastes but besides the fact-it was actually pretty good for a beer. so if you are wanting to drink something and u dont want to get a beer, i would recommend this one. They also had a david bowie beer (9% IPA) that they brewed the day bowie died. my friend rly rly enjoyed this one! Also, make sure to grab a pint glass souvenior on your way out! its only $4!!!! so cheap. and its super cutes. <br><br>ATMOSPHERE: this is such a cool space! its great for watching games, its great for catching up with friends, its great for eating with fam, its great for out of towners, its great for beer lovers, etc. there was no wait for us when we arrived on a saturday mornin around 12 noon. but it definitely DID fill up around the time we were leaving which was around 130-2. <br><br>PRO: they asked us if they could take our luggages and store them for us behind the front counter while we ate. I dont know many other places that do that for travelers, so EXTRA STAR if i could give it to them. when i was leaving, i saw that all of the baby strollers were also stored back there too, so it was rly nice. <br><br>highly recommended!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "If you are looking for a place to get good thin crust pizza that is affordable and also fun for a big group then this is the place.

Since cookie sheets don't retain as much heat as a stone, I can only imagine that the pizzas must be cooked longer, which makes the crust very hard. If you like harder crusts Piece would probably be great for you; these crusts were too hard for me. They weren't merely crunchy on the outside, they were hard all the way through.

We shared a medium plain red (traditional tomato sauce and mozzarella) and a large red topped with mashed potato, Italian sausage, pepperoni, and roasted red peppers. Most of us favored the loaded-up pie. The mashed potato (a New Haven thing from this one place called Bar) was a lovely topping, salty and soft in a way that worked well with the crispy/chewy crust.

I never thought I'd like pizza without the tomato sauce, but this was bomb white pizza. Seafood flavor was also amazing. <br><br>- White pizza with garlic and broccoli - I'm not a fan of veggie pizzas, so this was OKAY for me, but my friends loved it. The garlic wasn't overpowering, but compared to the other two pizzas, it was a little meh<br><br>Beer:<br><br>- Dark and curvy was really good. We also tried a \"beer cocktail\" mix of the Dark Chocolate Raspberry and the Oatmeal Stout. If you like sweet beers, or hard ciders, this is your drink.

Overall a solid pie and beers were good as well. <br><br>Now I'm going to show my \"Southport Side\" and say this place is total hipsterville. Our waitress was so hip, I'm honored she actually waited on us. Which was kind of a problem as service was pretty bad... She was hard to find, never really checked on us and whispered when she came to the table.

So going against everything Chi-caaa-go in me, I have to say that Piece is my favorite pizza place ever. <br><br>The pizzas are pretty much order completely custom to your selection of size, sauces (three to choose from; red, white, and New Haven style), cheeses, and toppings. I'm not a fan of white sauce pizzas, so I have yet to try that version, but the red and the New Haven style sauces are ridiculously good. The pizza comes out in a huge tray with the crispiest, most balanced pizzas I have had in Chicago. While the combination of toppings is up to you, I have yet to have a topping that I didn't think was fresh and delicious (especially the sausage). <br><br>We went on the first day that they offered Honey Butter Fried Chicken pizza (as a collaboration promotion they are doing for February). Being a fan of Honeybutter Fried Chicken and Piece, I naturally was very hyped to try it. While the pizza and the chicken were really high quality offerings, I think they're much better separate. It was a little bit of a let down, but still a good pizza. I think it's more for really hardcore fans of both these fine establishments, but if you're not, it's not the end of the world if you skip it. <br><br>Overall, Piece is awesome.

I still am not quite sure it does.<br><br>Let me explain: What I had at Piece was a very tasty, very flavorful, very mouthwatering... warm salad. Maybe cool soup. But it was not really pizza. As I said, the tastes were very terrific--I tried the Plain-style (New Haven) pie, but added spinach, feta, and tomatoes. I also started with the goat cheese appetizer (freaking delicious; wonderful marinara and, as advertised, a \"generous\" portion of cheese). The pie, however, was soupy; the crush was so thin and flat in the middle that it could not hold the toppings (or the sauce) on top. Everything just fell off ass the dough folded downward on itself. I had to fold the end of each slice back up on top of the wider portion to hold each slice in my hand.<br><br>Do not get me wrong--I really enjoyed how everything tasted. And the edges of the crush were crunchy and pleasant. But the middle third or more of the pie was just tomatoes and other toppings on very soggy, thin dough. Not what I'd call a pizza.<br><br>As another comment, I did not have opportunity to try the brewed beers. Those may very well be just as mouth-worthy as the food. But if I'm getting pizza, I don't want to have to use a fork (or spoon) to transfer the food from plate to pie-hole. Perhaps the pizza would hold up better with no toppings (only sauce, oregano, and Parmesan--true New Haven style [I'm told]). But it should be able to hold the weight of some extra tomatoes. The water weight should not be collapsing the dough; it is the medium, after all!<br><br>To sum up: Tastes = wonderful. Place = enjoyable. Beers = ? (I have a good feeling).

I once had a four hour layover in Chicago and actually took a cab to Piece, got a pizza and took it to my buddies in Park City Utah. My friends LOVED it and, as a side note, if you ever want to make friends with random people on a plane - bring a Piece Pizza. <br><br>One of my favorite things about Piece is the live Karaoke on Saturday nights. I don't sing, but it's great fun to hear the band, and the singers and the crowd get really into it. <br><br>As for the beer, I'm originally from Colorado which is the capital of microbreweries. Piece blows the Denver pubs away. <br><br>Right now, sitting in NYC, I wish I was in Chicago.

We came here on a Saturday for lunch and were seated right away. I liked the atmosphere, it was very hipster and chill. I liked that the roof was made out of glass so the sun can seep through. But yeah I was surprised to see the number of people having a couple of glasses of beer at 12 o clock in the afternoon but hey it's 6 o clock somewhere~ I can see it being a big hit when there's a game on because there's bar seating and plenty of TVs. ANYWAYS onto the food, we ordered chips and spinach dip as an appetizer, very flavorful and delicious I would definitely recommend it, the chips kind of tasted like Doritos. As for the pizza you get to pick whatever toppings, we put clams on half only and sausage on the other half. We also added mashed potatoes, garlic, and mushroom. (There's an option to put broccoli I definitely wanna try that) The pizza was good, nothing special but it wasn't bad either, I'm not a fan of thin crust, I like a good baked thick crust. They also have a wide selection of beer I really enjoyed mine, it was pretty strong too...<br><br>The only reason I give 2 stars is because the service is soooo bad. After being seated I think we waited a good 20-30 minutes and no one came by to even get our drink orders. I got fed up and got someone's attention who wasn't even a server but he offered to take our order anyways. I tried several times before to get someone's attention but they just walk on by. Rude.

The place gets very busy at peak times, so expect a wait (one hour plus) if that's when you decide to go. It's a huge place, but it's also hugely popular, so the wait really can't be helped.<br><br>Other - live band karaoke on Saturday nights. Some performers seem fairly legit.

Because I love their pizza a LOT.They call it New Haven-style, which maybe it is, but I've never been to New Haven, nor found another New Haven-style pizza place to compare it to. So all I know for sure is that it's awesome and pretty unique, especially for Chicago. The thin crust is the perfect mix of chewy and crunchy, the sauces are delicious, and the toppings are plentiful and flavorful. (My go-to combo: sausage, onion, goat cheese on a white pizza. I call it The Makeout Special.) Seriously one of the top 5 pizzas in Chicago, especially if you can't or won't commit to deep dish on a given night.<br><br>So if I love the pizza so much, why only three stars? I'm glad you asked; it's because literally everything else about this place is a pain in the ass. The Six Corners area of Wicker Park can be a nightmare to navigate. The restaurant itself is so crowded that there's always a wait if you are eating anywhere close to a normal mealtime (plus, everyone has a \"passed over at Piece\" horror story or two), and so loud that conversation is practically impossible. The non-pizza offerings are just average (although, to be fair, they might suffer from the fact that they are simply in the way of the pizza). Service tends to range from indifferent to downright bad (again, owing to the crowds). They do offer carry-out and delivery options which you would think would mitigate these problems, but the pizza doesn't travel as well as a Chicago-style pie (which I actually think benefits from the extra time to set). I guess you could order carry-out and then eat it in your double-parked car outside the restaurant, but that could get weird and/or messy.<br><br>Ultimately, the wonderful pizza makes up for the many other shortcomings. I like taking friends from out of town here because it not only shuts them up about pizza in Chicago being more like lasagna or whatever, but because the long wait and the noisy interior make it feel like an EVENT more than a meal.

I'm a Chicago deep dish pizza lover at heart so it's hard for me to get too excited about various thin crust options but piece makes a solid thin crust. They call it \"new haven\" style but that's likely just marketing. There are no pre-set pizzas to choose, everything is build your own and starts with one of four sauces: red, bbq, white and plain. Even though we arrived on the later end at 8:15 we still waited at least 45 minutes for a table and the place was always packed (maybe for thursday night karaoke??). I loved the feel and decor of the barn/brewery style. I could picture it on the side of a ski mountain out west if you added a fireplace and the loud noise of ski boots. The brand name beer was very good and deserving of the many awards decorating the walls. Ari and I enjoyed a sampler flight to make sure we didn't miss anything. Lastly, the value was surprisingly good. Three pizzas, one starter and some drinks we ended up at $20 a person all in with leftovers.<br><br>We started with a very tasty and perfectly sized spinach and cheese dip with tortilla chips. We were all very hungry and needed something before the pizza arrived. I don't know exactly how long we waited but it didn't seem out of the ordinary. We choose three different kinds of pizza to try and share - red sauce, white sauce and bbq sauce. The bbq had mushrooms, the red had pepperoni and onion and the white was artichoke, spinach and broccoli. Each pie had different strengths and all were tasty. My favorites were either the bbq or the pepperoni depending on the minute. I thought all the pizzas actually tasted better the more they cooled as the sauce became more firm and the crust hardened. The bbq would have been even better with a protein like chicken or something to go with the sweetness of the sauce. I did like the veggie white pizza but just not as much as the other two. All of the beers were very good, which is an accomplishment when there are six to try. My favorite was the anniversary ale.<br><br>I'm happy that our experience lived up to the good press and word of mouth.

There is no waiting space, so you're really just blocking a thoroughfare. Leading to that awkward feeling several Wicker Park places give you... the hipster staff is annoyed by you being in the way. (Wormhole, Bangers and Lace, Big Star, etc)<br>Only other beef with them - have a deposit system for your growlers! You get $3 off your next growler by bringing one in. But what if I just want to return them so they stop taking up room in my apartment? You get $0. What about a coupon for a future purchase? Or just give me the $3? So I end up recycling them when I can't stand it anymore -bad system. While I'm on the growler topic - if you delivered growlers, that would also be excellent, and help with this issue.<br>Aside from growler rant - favorite pizza place in Wicker Park (if we're not counting deep dish- then you have to go for Lou Malnati's).", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I like that they make their own beer and pizza is alright", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Waited over an hour to be seated on a Sunday night.

I have told friends not to go here and expect deep dish. Piece is pretty up front about that since they come right out & say it. <br><br>There's Chicago, New York & the style they make- New Haven style. The best way to understand this is that the crust is more flat than thin. The way the dough is made and how it's cooked are totally different methods of cooking (that's a story in itself; I believe they call it \"apizza\"). The texture is closest to Neapolitan style. The sauce is also a bit different and you choose from the following: red (tomato sauce and mozzarella pizza), plain a traditional New Haven pizza, a generous amount of red sauce topped with garlic, extra parmesan and olive oil (This pizza does not have mozzarella.) & white plain crust brushed with olive oil, diced garlic and mozzarella cheese. <br><br>I kept my pizza somewhat simple- I went with red. Now things get expensive once you start adding other toppings. I added sausage & mushrooms ($2.00/each). Still, the taste was very good. The rest of the menu is pretty straight forward- 4 sandwiches, 4 appetizers, 3 salads and 5 deserts.

Every time you end up with some Orange Chicken or Mongolian Beef because the menu is so confused? Do you just want to try something different? Some real Chinese food, not those American Chinese food?<br>My friend he told me that he never picks which Chinese restaurant to go, because he can always find the same dish in every one of them. It is sad but true at the same time. However, Sing's Noodles is the restaurant only serves the traditional Chinese noodles. Compare to Joy Yee's Noodle Shop, the menu here is surprisingly simple, it is only one page without any American Chinese food, but the real Chinese food. <br>The first thing you are going to see after you step into the restaurant is an old Chinese man who is pulling the noodle behind the glass window. It is the specialty of this noodle restaurant that every noodle dish they served here is made by hand pulled noodle. It's quite a process for you who had never seen how the noodle is made. Other than that the restaurant itself has been well designed into a modern style. Unlike other Chinese restaurant with the crowded dining section, the light color and big glass wall was used to make the Sing's Noodles' dining section very bright and comfortable. Look to the right, you will find a big ancient Chinese painting was sculptured on the wall.<br>After you sit down the waiter will hand the menu to you. As people wonder about the service in this restaurant, I would say it is around average. They are not the kind of waiter you can find in the fancy restaurant who will treat you like a god, but they will be absolutely helpful to guide you to the right dish.<br>Now it's time to check this super simple menu. There are around forty options that are mainly noodles with couple side dish, such as the dumplings. The price average is around $8 dollar. If you will notice that there are lots of noodle dishes are beef, but from different part of cow. For my suggestion that if you are not Asian and it's the first time you try it, don't pick any strange one. Because they can be the meat from internal organ such as the large intestine. <br>Now let's eat. The noodle dish comes with a big portion, and for my personal favorite, I like the Beef Hand-Pulled Noodle the best. You can see the big pieces of juicy beef are on the top of hand-pulled noodle with some white carrot and parsley is filling up in the bowl. Before you start, take the spoon and taste the soup first. The soup is full of flavor of beef combined with some spicy and fresh taste. From that taste, you can tell it's the soup from the stew beef bone. <br>Take a bite of the beef; it is the best experience of the whole dish. Beef is so well cooked, which it is both chewy and soft. Part of beef they picked is not the regularly steak beef you will find in the American restaurant. It is the part close to the joint; the meat is mixed with some cartilage. For you have never eaten the cartilage before, please give a try. It is amazingly soft and smooth. In order to cook the cartilage into that condition, the chief must stew the beef for at least 4 hours. <br>Now the noodle, it is not much special about its hand pulled specialty, I couldn't tell the different between the hand pulled noodle and the machine pulled one. They taste exactly the same for me and because it was hand pulled, which caused the noodle became too thick to eat and the smooth feeling of the noodle was lost. <br>Over all I will give the credit for the ingredients and soup of Sing's Noodles. Even the hand-pulled noodle doesn't give much specialty for the dish, but everything else is well cooked. And as a complete piece of noodle dish, I have enjoyed it a lot. <br>Compare to the portion and the price of the dish, I would say $8.25 for a big bowl of delicious Beef Hand-Pulled Noodle is totally worth it. Especially in the cold winter night of the Chicago, there is nothing better than a big bowl of hot noodle can make you happier. As you eating you will realize that there always some more beef hidden under the noodle. <br>I haven't try out all the dishes serviced in this restaurant, but from what I had experienced, I strongly recommend Sing's Noodles to those who loves Chinese noodles and want to try some real Chinese food.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I'm a true Chicagoan so I know what I am talking about when it comes to pizza...this place is AMAZING!

Awesome combination of salty & sweet (and healthy too, cuz of the spinach!). <br><br>Of course Piece is a microbrew, so I have to mention the beers.

Just to name a few there is Ripasso for high end authentic Italian, Schwa for the wildest Michelin star meal imaginable, Violet Hour for creative cocktails in a chic ambiance, Big Star for tacos, Mindy's Hot Chocolate for James Beard winning desserts and so much more. While Chicago has the reputation for being a mecca for deep dish pizza, growing up on the East coast I have always preferred thin crust. Piece is widely regarded as one of Chicago's best thin crust pizza venues. As my condo was taken over by a large group of women (my wife was throwing a baby shower) I met up with a buddy for some pizza and beer (Piece is also a brewery and makes there own beer - but supplements their menu with additional craft beers).<br><br>My prior visits to Piece have been during dinner where Piece is usually packed to the gills, extremely loud and has a lengthy wait for a table. They do open daily at 11:00am for lunch and I arrived just before opening and was the first inside. Piece has the ambiance of a typical microbrewery with the only difference being it is also a pizza joint. The main dining room is quite large, loud and there is a very casual ambiance (in fact one of the servers made for some good people watching; she looked kind of like Miley Cyrus will look like in a couple of years after she obtains a few more tattoos and piercings). There are several televisions (generally displaying sporting events) and the music plays a variety of Hip Hop and rock. The crowd is mainly young and with pizza being featured there are far more families with children (especially during the daytime) than at a typical brewery. <br><br>We started off our lunch with a round of beer. I perked up a bit when our server asked for my ID thinking that perhaps there was a senior discount; I quickly slipped her a fake ID (as I am not quite yet a senior citizen) but alas she simply had somehow confused me as a teenager. Aside from this she provided us with fairly good service. At lunchtime the pizzas are quite a deal; they offer personal pizzas for just $6 to $8 (depending on the number of toppings). While if you have a hearty appetite you may need to order two (or an appetizer), they are decent sized for the price. There are a ton of toppings to choose from with your typical items as well as some interesting choices such as mashed potatoes. You also pick from three different styles of pizza - Red (traditional), White (no tomato sauce) and New Haven style (no mozzarella cheese).  I opted for a \"white\" pizza with clams, mushrooms and bacon. The pizza was (as usual)  flavorful and very good and the beers decent. <br><br>If you are in the mood for some good thin crust pizza in a lively, energetic atmosphere Piece is a great choice. If you go in the evening (especially on a weekend) do be prepared to wait unless you arrive real early (or have a party of ten or larger in which case you can make a reservation).

Well guy you could have recommended me something, instead of being rude. So I ended up with just a water because I had no clue what to order.

They had already crossed off about 17 names after mine. The response I received was \"Oh, I didn't recognize you without the jacket you had on when you came in.\" Say wha?!?! What do you do in the wintertime when people have coats?!? And why didn't someone walk through the bar calling my name (they had my first AND last name)?!?

How \"done\" does cheese and crust need to be? She gave an exasperated sigh and even an eye roll and said that she was told we asked for our pizza well done. No, sorry, that wasn't us. Another eye roll and she was gone. <br><br>What is going on up in this joint?!?!? There are so many people out of work and would kill for a job, yet Piece is hiring these yahoos that treat their customers like crap. And the pizza wasn't even good enough to be worth all of this aggravation! Everything would have been forgiven if the staff had been nicer, but the attitude along with everything else just made me angry. <br><br>At this point, I was d.o.n.e. with Piece. I asked to see the manager. I complained. He got defensive and a little argumentative. We were switched to another table and our waitress came over to move our pizza, except that she did it with such force that a plate was knocked over and a piece of pizza went flying into my friends lap. <br><br>Piece, you suck.

By the time the whole group got there, we were split into separate booths in the same section. Kind of annoying, but no biggie. Everyone else wanted crazy toppings on their pizzas, but all I wanted was a standard margarita pizza (mozzarella, tomato, basil) I was very happy with my personal pizza since the crust was PERFECT! Perfect to the point of growling like a raccoon when my sister tried to swipe a piece. I think the quality of the crust goes down as the size of the pizza increases, so I wouldn't go bigger than a medium.<br><br>I tried Piece again with a friend, since he's a Wisconsin lovin', vegetable hatin' carnivore we got pepperoni pizza. I was sorely disappointed when the pepperoni greased up the pizza so much that I could barely eat it, in fear of igniting my acid reflux. <br><br>I'd give this place another chance since it's in a convenient location, the pizza's good when its on the smaller side, and MAKER'S MARK MONDAYS!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "What more can be said about Piece?  Not much.  It's good.  Darn good.  And when you combine good pizza with good beer, it's even better.  <br><br>A note to the newbies, don't blow your wad on toppings.  I know, I know, they all sound droolicious, but we're talking thin crust here.  Too many toppings and you'll need three hands to hold each slice.  Or you'll need to use a knife and fork.  And please... that's LAME, not to mention the slices won't fit on a plate.  <br><br>My only reason for docking a star is because this place is alway busy.  And that's spectacular for them, but their system for letting people know that their table is ready on a jam packed Saturday night involves one host pushing through the bar crowd screaming someone's name that the table is now ready.  I can't hear you.  I'm drinking my Camel Toe and screaming over the crowd so that my friends can hear me tell a hilarious story.  What's wrong with little buzzers, yo?  Or is that too efficient for the Wicker Park scene?", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I love coming here! The pizza is sooo good! I came here a couple of times and the only downside is that it is usually very busy and the wait could be up to an hour.

You'd be surprise how many places can mess up a thin crust pizza in this city. Piece is definitely one of the best in the city! I've had all the different combinations with different sauces and I can't think of one time where I didn't like the pizza. <br><br>I also have to give props to the service. The place is always busy and it can get crowded on the weekends. I don't have an extensive knowledge of beer but the staff is more than happy to give some recommendations based on what types of beers you typically drink. Each time I ordered, the waitress recommend I try something different and I enjoyed the 3 types I got. So kudos to that.<br><br>Also on Saturdays, they have live band karoake which is an attraction in of itself. After a few drinks, you'll have the liquid courage to take a stab at it. The crowd coming through it as diverse the Bucktown/Wicker Park area is.<br><br>With large groups, I definitely recommend getting a reservation, especially on the weekends. It's definitely an energetic atmosphere. So if you're looking for a laid back area, perhaps coming during lunch or off hours to enjoy the pizza.", "pics": null}}]}
