We were there for dinner before a show at the Oriental Theater on a Saturday night and the place was packed - make sure to make a reservation ahead of time (I made mine 3 weeks ahead of time)! <br><br>Bread and water are brought to the table right away. There is olive oil and balsamic vinegar already on the table. We ordered the red sangria right away and loved it. <br><br>We had a great server who was attentive but wasn't overbearing. Since it was our first time there, she walked us through their menu and explained that their dishes are similar to Spanish tapas - smaller and made to share. I like to enjoy a sampling of different food so this was perfect! <br><br>To start, we ordered the Carne Salada and Provolone off their meats and cheese section. Great serving size for two and came with an apricot preserve (perfect with the sharpness of the provolone), pickled vegetables, and pumpernickel bread.<br><br>Next, we ordered the fried calamari. It was good calamari and came with lemon and marinara. It didn't blow my socks off but definitely nothing to complain about. <br><br>We ordered a fettuccine Alfredo to share and the serving size was just right! I'm not a huge fan of pasta but I would happily order more if I go there again, the flavor of the Alfredo and texture of the pasta were great! <br><br>We decided to do dessert as well - I ordered tiramisu, which was off menu, and she ordered the Torta al Cioccolato. Both were delicious and a great way to end the meal. <br><br>I must say, this place goes above and beyond and doesn't break the bank. We had a 4 course meal and a liter of sangria for $80 with great service. It is loud and busy throughout the restaurant so if you're looking for a quiet place, this definitely isn't the restaurant for you. Luckily, it was just my cup of tea and I can't wait to go back!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "If you have never dined here, do yourself a favor and study the menu prior to dining.  The menu is confusing at first glance. Just know everything is designed to be shared. We had reservations for a Friday night. We were promptly seated in an overly crowded dining room. <br>To be completely honest, food was great BUT the restaurant is so incredibly loud it can be disorienting. <br>For my wife and I, we enjoyed sharing the following: the olives; goat cheese ricotta appetizer; kale salad (awesome); and pappardelle with braised beef. Order at your own pace and not all at once as this place is quick on the service. <br>In summary, food is a 4, service 3, noise 1, crowded dining room 1, and ambiance 3.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Simple, elegant and traditional Italian restaurant.

Kudos to them happily taking it back and not charging us.<br><br>Sadly, we really left Quartino underwhelmed and hungry.  So much so in fact that we walked a few blocks after dining here and found ourselves stopping at a pizza place for actual dinner.  <br><br>Would I be against paying Quartino Ristorante a visit again?  No.  We fell in love with our Chicago visit and will be back to the city next year.<br><br>I also would love a shot at that bread, olive oil and balsamic again, because they were delicious!  <br><br>We may be back to give Quartino Ristorante another shot, but it'll take a while for us to explore what else has to offer first.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uyE92Tvl-jyGD7HBnf7VTQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "Burrata salad"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0cJM7NrSUX7MOE-OR36n2Q/168s.jpg", "caption": "Ravioli"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/libMYTdE6Jp3UwzYnhXc1g/168s.jpg", "caption": "Minestrone soup"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "9/15/18 - Went here on a Saturday afternoon with a good friend who also just so happened to have worked for the place.

The pros to this place you ask? We sat on the balcony overlooking state and grand. The service was amazing and quick. The food was delivered in a reasonable time. <br><br>Cons? The balcony was a bit over crowded. They sat their largest groups outside. The beef pappardelle was a bit too chewy. Of course it's a real Italian restaurant but the noodles were a bit too tough for me and too little sauce. The Brodetto al frutti di mare wasn't too my liking let alone my sight. Looked a little to yellowish-green. The sauce wasn't that good either; overly salty and not in a good way. <br>I can honestly say I loved the appetizers more than the actual meals.

(I know. I know. I'm behind on some reviews but the photos were still lingering on my phone.) The experience is just as memorable. My father initially wanted to go here because it was recommended from one of his friends and not something I actually bookmarked and mentally noted after scouring through lists of places I wanted to personally check out. Definitely a great place. It was packed when we arrived. Wine was really delicious and I like that they had some pretty good deals on if you went with like a carafe or half or even quarter carafe. They separate them also by the intensity with being light, medium, or full bodied. So smart and educated this wine list. They apparently have weekday lunch specials for $8 sandwiches. <br><br>For appetizers we had sicilian cured olives in oil, calamari, and dates wrapped in pancetta, stuffed with gorgonzola and drizzled with honey. The calamari was nice. The olives were actually really good and I hate most olives but for some reason I was going to town on these. But I also remember being starving at this dinner because I skipped lunch. But do yourself a favor and get those dates. Lord. I would have ordered five more of those suckers. <br><br>Entrees we split a few things family style. Portions are on the smaller-medium side. I feel like I got two spoonfuls per dish and was still hungry when I went back to the hotel. But I think I would have been more satisfied if I just ordered my own entree instead of sharing with my kin. But we split the pappardelle with braised beef in a tomato sauce and the porcini and truffle risotto thinking it would be enough for four people and momma (me) objected and insisted we order a pizza with fennel sausage. A really smart idea because no one does sausage pizza better than Chicago. It was brick oven style and more on the personal pizza size but really good tasting. The pasta and risotto were good. The risotto slightly moreso than the pasta. But I feel like their pizza and wine and apps are really where they shine the best. Regardless, it was a surprisingly decent meal from a random suggestion.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Came here last night by accident, we were walking by and i saw that they serve APEROL Sprtizers and was like... yep, this is where we are going! We started out at the bar and had a few drinks and apps until my sister arrived. Our service was excellent from the server Trevor! He was so quick and had excellent recommendations for us. We had the goat milk ricotta and the bruschetta for apps. Holy cow! The ricotta had a side of this amazing honey to drizzle on top of the ricotta and it was to die for! Something to definitely try if this is your first time!!!!!!!! The bruschetta was good as well. The lemonchello  that they serve is homemade and outstanding! So much flavor in such a little glass! We moved to the dining room for dinner and kinda all shared everything as directed by our server. We started out with the calamari, which was so fresh and so tasty!! Then the baratta salad, which had beats and a fresh cheese ball on top, so light but so good. My mom had a bowl of the chicken soup, which she absolutely loved. The shrimp risotto was to die for! The chicken Alfredo had the freshest, thinnest noodles I've ever had. Such flavor! I had the Cavatelli and could NOT stop eating it. Everything tasted fresh, came out hot, and we had such great service. The only downside to this restaurant is how tight the seating is/ and the noise is very loud on a Friday night.

I loved the balance of saltiness from the pancetta and sweetness from the date. <br><br>+ Bruschetta - 9/10 - this comes with 3 large pieces cut in half. Each piece has a different topping. I tried the eggplant and the tomato pieces. I really liked the eggplant one. It was delicious!<br><br>+ Pollenta Fries - 7/10 - these were okay. They weren't amazing but weren't bad. Honestly I wish they were cheese sticks instead. Haha. <br><br>+ Margarita Pizza - 9/10 - this was pretty good. No complaints. I loved the big pieces of basil. <br><br>+ Linguine with Clams - 8/10 - this was pretty good. I wish the sauce was a bit creamier but regardless I really enjoyed it. <br><br>+ Penne alla Vodka - 10/10 - I loved this! The Vodka sauce was thick and creamy and amazing. Order this!<br><br>+ Crispy Calamari - 9/10 - I love calamari and this did not disappoint! I wish the marinara was a little bit thicker but overall a great dish. <br><br>+ Tagliatelle alla Bolognese - 9/10 - this was pretty good. The sauce was a great consistency. I wish there was a little more meat in it but I still really enjoyed it. <br><br>Overall it was a great night with friends.

We sat at a table in the bar area. Someone quickly brought us water, bread, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The bread has not changed it's just as good as the first time we've had it. We make a mixture of the olive oil, balsamic and Parmesan cheese to dip the bread in and it's amazing!<br><br>For food we ordered the veal meatballs in tomato sauce and penne alla vodka. This is our go to meal we don't even look at the menu. It's 6 large meatballs and a decent amount of pasta. My husband and I are able to share both items and are full from it. <br><br>At first a server brought out meatballs but it was not the type we ordered. They brought us the veal meatballs with the raisins not tomato sauce. He quickly took them back and told our server. Within about 5 minutes both our pasta and correct meatballs came out. Both dishes were just as good as we remember them. The pasta could have been a little warmer but it was okay. <br><br>I changed my rating from a 5/5 to a 4/5 because of the server. Other than taking our order, asking if we were done and then handing us our check we never saw her.

She could hardly finish it. <br><br>I was originally going to order the pizza with duck prosciutto but then I found out that they ran out for the month! I was so disappointed, but ended up ordering the shrimp risotto. My friends ordered the gnocchi in a pesto sauce, linguine with clams with a side of asparagus. We also got a side of six meatballs in tomato sauce. The risotto was good and creamy, but a bit bland. I do wish I ordered the porcini and truffle risotto instead. The gnocchi was soft and pillowy in a very dreamy pesto sauce. The linguine was light and flavorful. The asparagus was lightly seasoned and cooked to perfection. The meatballs were yummy, but the sauce it was in was amazing! I could drink it. For dessert, we ordered the tiramisu. Absolutely incredible.

The first time I came here, I had a few glasses of wine in me so I thought everything tasted AMAZING. I honestly don't remember what my party of 14 ordered, but we all loved the food and spent only ~$400 if my memory serves me right. I would absolutely recommend reserving their wine room, which seats up to 16 people, if you're trying to find a nice place for dinner for a large group without breaking the bank (you don't have to do a private dining menu, you can just order normally!). I love that it's shared plates family style, so everyone can try a bite of everything. <br><br>The last two times I've come here, I wasn't as impressed. I still thought the food overall was good, but nothing really blew me away. That being said, I will still be coming back to try other dishes if I'm in the area.<br><br>Onto my thoughts on the dishes I've had:<br>Duck prosciutto was good but the portion size was small. Their margherita pizza ($13) was good but nothing special, would recommend either trying a more specialty/complex pizza. The rigatoni ($13.75) is delicious--I remember the waitress saying that it once was up for a James Beard award? The tagliatelle alla bolognese ($12.50), which is one of their homemade pastas, was just okay. The noodles themselves were not that impressive, which was disappointing at an Italian restaurant. We still finished the plate but all the while wishing we had ordered something different. The steamed clams were SO salty. I don't know if that was a fluke, but it was almost to the point of being inedible. They serve grilled bread with the clams, but there was no way you could dip the bread into the liquid because it was so salty. Regardless, the clams were so tiny that it wouldn't have been worth the $14.25. <br><br>Because the prices overall aren't too steep, I've still felt satisfied with my food after every meal and haven't written Quartino off my list yet!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/m6k541fUvvsJdDjuCQ8Z6Q/348s.jpg", "caption": "Tagliatelle alla Bolognese"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6p1IMR1rjBNgW393x92Mwg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Margherita pizza"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zGtEsRNl9XyqtUAB_qZg4g/168s.jpg", "caption": "Steamed Clams"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "I was looking for a place to have a bite that wouldn't cost too much money...

A lot of people coming here must mean the food is good right?<br><br>ATMOSPHERE/ARCHITECTURE: 8/10<br><br>This place has a homey, classic feel to it, utilizing a lot of dark wood to set the ambience. There is always some old Italian movie playing in the background and apparently Al Capone and his crew used to hang around here back in the 1920s/30s. The restaurant is large and has a lot of seating. Easily 150+ and that is a conservative estimate. It was a little bit packed and tight for space in my opinion, but that just means it is doing very well.<br><br>SERVICE : 3/10<br><br>They were very busy but that is no excuse for the handful of marred mistakes that were made that were actually pretty big. We had ordered a birthday cake for a friend and it was supposed to come with a candle. No candle. Strike one. I ordered braised pork shank which I will get into later and it said it comes with organic vegetables. No vegetables. Strike two. And lastly, one our friends was struck with a bill double what it should have been at the end. Luckily she was immediately take aback and asked about it before realizing it was a mistake and it was a double charge, but this is a pretty grave mistake. Strike three.<br><br>FOOD: 8/10<br><br>Braised Pork Shank - First off, WHERE were the organic vegetables?! I would have entirely forgotten about this until someone at my table mentioned that it was supposed to come with some organic vegetables. Disappointed. However, the braised pork shank is FANTASTIC. The meat is cooked to perfect tenderness so that it falls off the bone and melts in your mouth. The flavor is really perfect to me. Not too salty. Some might find it a bit bland but I think it was seasoned exactly as I wanted. HIGHLY recommended. Just ask for the vegetables next time.<br><br>D'Anitra Pizze - Pizza with duck prosciutto which is cured in house with onion and wild agugula. The pizza overall was really good. Very authentic Italian style pizza that is different from a lot of the Americanized offerings in Chicago.<br><br>Pouilly-Fuisse White Wine - Very smooth clear tasting wine that had a little tartness to it. I thought this was a very good white wine and good choice for someone who wants something a little sweeter and lighter.<br><br>Gavi DOCG del Comune White Wine - Very similar to the Pouilly-Fuisse except with less tartness and also less sweetness. I thought it was good was well but preferred the Pouilly-Fuisse over this one.<br><br>PROBABILITY OF RETURN: 6/10<br><br>I would definitely consider returning here to try other food options.

The menu is largely tapa style but I really enjoyed its fresh aesthetic. We got the lunch special that allowed you to generously pick an appetizer, a pasta, and a seafood/meat of your choice from the menu WITHOUT restrictions (none of that prix fix business). We also added on a burrata and a veal slider, as the lunch was designed to be shared amongst two people and we felt it wouldn't be enough to satiate us. The appetizers were all great. Got the dates wrapped in pancetta and it was delicious, albeit slightly oilier than I anticipated. Really enjoyed the contrast of the sweet and soft dates with the crispy and salty pancetta. Veal sliders were also good but I think one can never go wrong with veal. The burrata was to die for IMO! My partner felt it was a bit flavorless but when you sprinkle the slightest amount of salt and pepper, it hit the spot so well. The cheese was fresh fresh fresh and it was so creamy and rich. MmmMm! We got the gnocchi as our pasta order and it was excellent although I felt it was a bit too hard/chewy for me to render it exceptional. I guess I like my gnocchi a bit softer .. but the pesto sauce that drenched the gnocchi was great, although I did wish it had a stronger basil flavor. The octopus was also excellent and featured a gentle balsamic vinaigrette typical of many Mediterranean dishes. Overall, would I return?

There was more cheese than meat, which I am fine with, but both have super intense flavors: the cheese was rich and nutty while the soppressata was spicy and gamy. Got the clams and linguini for the main course. Dare is say this but it's better than my grandmothers. Okay, that's not fair to say because it's a different style of execution but there were 13 clams in the dish. The sauce was buttery with a lot of herbs in it. Noodles were perfect al dente.

We hardly touched the dish and he never asked why when he came to drop the check. <br>At the beginning of the meal, William insisted we keep a menu at the table in case we wanted to order more food. As we had no where to put it, it end up on the floor next to us. The table of older ladies next to us stood up, stepped on it, and slipped on it. No worries Bc William made them keep a menu too and theirs was also on the floor. We all had a chuckle about the ridiculousness of menus strewn about on the floor. Seems that if we wanted more food, certainly our server should be able to fetch a menu...if he had bothered to check on either table. <br>In the end, I had to apologize to my guests for making a bad restaurant choice.

Now if a Italian place can make a excellent meatball then it's a legit place to me and this place meatballs are out of this world. The meatballs was so tender, juicy and seasoned so well. Even the tomato sauce was delicious. Both the beef short ribs and pork shank was tender and seasoned well. To me they both kind of taste the same like they use the same sauce. It didn't really wow me but cooked very well. The pizza was very good. Very fresh ingredients they used. This might be the freshest pizza I ever had along with the calamari.

Our server was Miguel, and he was excellent: very attentive and kind without being overbearing. Their Italian sodas (we had the raspberry and the blood orange flavors) were absolutely delicious.<br><br>The first pasta plate we split was the tagliatelle with Bolognese sauce. We are more used to the ground meat-type of Bolognese sauce (i.e., a mix of ground veal, pork, beef, etc.) and this sauce seemed like more of a shredded pork ragout. It wasn't bad but we did not love it. Our next shared plate was the porcini and truffle risotto. Again, this plate was a little disappointing, since I remember ordering it several years back with two girlfriends and we had LOVED this luxurious, rich dish. The risotto was VERY over-cooked, my daughter said it was too mushy. And every bite was oddly gritty, like the mushrooms hadn't been properly rinsed (it literally felt like I was crunching on sand). We next split the fettuccini alfredo and the sauce was extremely delicious and silky. HOWVER, the problem I had with both the tagliatelle and the fettucine was that both pastas were extremely chewy and dense (not al dente, but undercooked/chewy) and needed a heavier hand with the salt. I wanted to salt both dishes but resisted since this seemed sacrilegious...but someone back in the kitchen really forgot to salt the pasta water.  Our last shared course was the steamed clams and these were STELLAR. The broth was gorgeous and tasted delicious but unfortunately we were too full with the mediocre pasta dishes to fully enjoy this excellent dish!<br><br>I really think this was an off night for the kitchen, pasta-wise. I still love Quartino's and I fully intend to come back the next time we are in Chicago. The total bill for TONS of food and two Italian sodas/refills was about $60 (before tip for the excellent service) which you will be hard pressed to top elsewhere downtown.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lBpoF3pSym3qD0neYzv69w/348s.jpg", "caption": "Our server was Miguel, and he was very nice!"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "I've been coming here consistently for the past 6 years and I will continue to keep coming.<br><br>The prices are reasonable<br>The service is amazing<br>The drinks are exceptional<br>The pappardelle is to die for<br>The place is open late<br>The employees make you feel special<br><br>Go and thank me later!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "My coworkers and I from Houston, Texas were in town and looking to get some great pizza and Italian food.  Well look no further, we settled on Quartino's.

A toast with a DELICOUS fluffy goat cheese spread, bacon wrapped blue cheese filled dates, and a meat platter with (I believe) pickled onions of some sort.

The brussel sprouts were delicious, but in my opinion, its hard to screw up brussel sprouts as long as you add tons of oil/butter. <br># Price: 4/5 - cocktails are WAY overpriced - but other than that, seemed pretty standard for tapas in the city. <br><br>Bottom line: If you don't mind being packed like a sardine and meh service, this place is worth going to.

You will be served with complimentary bread which actually tastes pretty good with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. We settled for the $25 lunch special which essentially allowed us to choose three different dishes from the main sections of the menu. Our choices ended up being the beet salad, linguine with clams, and the calamari.<br><br>I am a fan of beets and the salad did not disappoint. The salad contained beets and burratta cheese. It seemed as if there were two different kinds of beets in the salad. One came in the cubed form and was juicy and flavorful while the other came in a sliced form and tasted more like sliced carrots. I definitely enjoyed eating the cubed beets more since the sliced beets were pretty flavorless and dry. The burratta was extremely creamy and burst when I cut it with a fork. Although the flavoring of the cheese itself was a bit watered down, it complemented the strong flavor of the cubed beets well.<br><br>The linguine with clams dish was actually smaller than I was expecting. There was the option of a red or white sauce with this dish and we opted for the white. The sauce was a wine sauce so it was not creamy. For pasta, I thought the linguine dish was actually pretty light. After I finished eating, I did not feel weighed down. The clams were pretty tiny and there weren't that many unfortunately.<br><br>Ordering the calamari was a mistake. I need to remember that eating fried foods in large quantities is neither enjoyable nor desirable. The portion size for this order was pretty big and we were unable to finish the dish completely. In addition, the calamari was a bit soggy which made it even more difficult to consume. This was definitely one of the weaker dishes we had ordered.<br><br>On top of the lunch special, my friend and I mistakenly ordered the Gran Coppa Quartino dessert. The description of the dessert may seem tempting, but let me warn you that it is actually just a very mediocre, overpriced dessert in disguise. The gelato tasted extremely artificial and the screaming shade of pink of the strawberry gelato did not help one bit.<br><br>If you are looking for a reasonably priced meal for lunch, stopping by Quartino and getting the $25 lunch special is actually not a bad deal.

This restaurant scene is active and lively, so you're bound to have a great experience regardless if you come alone or with a group. <br><br>The menu consists of a broad range of items. You want something carb heavy, go for a pasta dish! You want some simple snacks you say, well how about a classic charcuterie! How about something simple, refreshing, and just decadent enough without the typical Italian fare guilt.. definitely opt in for the ricotta! All the items on the menu are priced amazing fare, if not a bargain for the quality and flavors of the dishes! You really can't go wrong coming here and trying this place out!<br><br>Dishes I tried:<br><br>-Ricotta: To be honest, I've never been a fan of these cheese. But this is the one place that has changed my mind.. get it. done deal!<br><br>- Veal meatballs (traditional style): Tender, juicy, and just the right about of sauce without masking the natural flavors of the meat itself. Get it.<br><br>-Baby Spinach salad: lackluster and the table did not finish it. Pass on it..<br><br>-Penne alla vodka: I love a good vodka sauce and this was a perfect touch to getting a few bites of a heavy pasta without feeling weighed down. Creamy and silky with bold but simplistic flavors.. get it!<br><br>-Broccoli rabe- it's is rabe and not traditional broccoli florets, it tastes similar to a sauteed spinach with more texture. Pleasantly surprised with the bold garlic notes and a pinch of spice. Get it!<br><br>-Octopus: If it haven't said it enough in my reviews, Chicago is my all time favorite city to get octopus plates, and Quartino did not disappoint! Charred perfectly with bites of smokey flavor. Must get!<br><br>-Porcini & truffle risotto- Creamy, heavy and lacked the truffle notes. Also was a bit undercooked.

Unfortunately, I took her to a mediocre one. <br><br>We arrived for our reservation and were seated by the hosts who were doing their job without any degree of enthusiasm. One person at the host stand told another a table number, looked at me, and said to follow him. We arrived at the table and he asked if we were 3 or 4. I said just 2, but noticed we'd picked up a straggler en route to the table. She said \"I think you're seating us.\" Host looked confused. We looked confused. She looked confused. He told us to stay and told her they'd get another table together. I think the host who told him the table got the parties mixed up. <br><br>The place goes just past cozy into crowded. The woman at the table adjacent to us elbowed one of our dishes just trying to get her purse from the back of her chair. If they took 3 or 4 tables out it would be a different experience, but I expect it's a cash cow and they'd like 3 tables more cash. <br><br>The food was a mixed bag. The spinach arrived first. It was very garlicky, but that was hard to taste in the absence of garlic's essential partner-- salt. Once we added a bit it was delish. It needed twice the salt and half the oil. The cavatelli, however, was from heaven. It was light for a potato based pasta, which you can only achieve making it in house. The sauce was a simple, fresh-tasting tomato sauce, with loads of flavorful ricotta. This dish was a winner. The final dish was the vegetarian pizza, which I'd been excited about. With zucchini, eggplant, cauliflower, and asparagus, how could I go wrong? Well... I did. First bite was weird and bitter. Arugula? I usually love it in salad or on pizza, but *could* this be unusually bitter. I took it off. Still weird and bitter! My mom didn't taste it on the first couple bites, but when she did she couldn't get rid of the taste. We discovered it was the eggplant. It was bad. It smelled and tasted like an old sock. Nothing can convince me it wasn't old and spoiled. The server, who was also doing his job with no enthusiasm, apologized, gave us a ridiculous line about eggplant being bitter this time of year, and took it away, but it remained on the bill. It should not have. <br><br>The caramelized banana dessert sounded different and yummy. It was fine, but it's not really a banana dessert. It's vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce with a 2 inch piece of banana cut in half and placed on top. The sorbet trio was refreshing, with the lemon being the standout and the orange and raspberry being a standard sherbet. <br><br>I really loved that pasta dish, but I wouldn't go back due to the spoiled food and lackluster service.

It was not light and fluffy like you would expect, and it would get stuck to the fork when we took a bite. The texture of it was totally off and tasted bland.

We ended up ordering calamari, soprano pizza, pappardelle in a braised beef tomato sauce, shrimp with garlic, red chilis, olive oil, and white wine. Each were well-made and had fantastic proportions for the price, but the stars out of the bunch were the calamari and soprano pizza.<br><br>The calamari had a light coating and it was crispy and yummylicious. The meat itself was tender and seasoned nicely. I only spotted 2 tentacles, but the other pieces were so well done that it didn't matter. The soprano pizza was divine, and the crust made it. Sure the veal meatballs brought the base flavor profile, but the crust had just the right amount of chew and crispy texture. We had to be so careful not to devour the whole thing in one sitting, otherwise, we would have not been able to eat the rest of the food!<br><br>We ended the night with a delicious dessert of zeppoles. They are fried doughnuts, but so airy and fluffy. To accompany each bite are dark chocolate and honey. The combination of the two sauces together is like experiencing nirvana. Absolutely loved every bite, and for $6.25, it was plenty for the two of us.<br><br>Each dish that we had ranged in prices from $10-$15, and there was plenty of food to take home. We ordered 4 savory dishes and 1 dessert, and we could have easily just gone with 2 dishes and the dessert.

The mushroom risotto that the waitress said was the \"best thing on the menu\" was pretty much inedible due to salt content.

We originally asked for a bottle of Rosso, but the waiter insisted we get one liter for the four of us ($20).<br><br>For starters, we also ordered the dates wrapped in pancetta ($7) and poleta fries ($8.50). I would say that these two were the best dishes. Both were flavorful and tasty, except you're not given much and it's gone within minutes. We also added the Brodetto Ai Frutti Di Mare seafood dish ($16.50), which came with shrimp, clams, calamari, octopus and whitefish simmered in aqua pazza with san marzano tomatoes. It came topped with two garlic toasts, which was good dipped in the sauce. It could've use more flavor as it was a bit watered down.<br><br>This place just isn't something I'm in favor of.

This was our least favorite item on the menu. Next came out the eggplant parm. Asides from it being on the saltier side., the taste was great. There was a nice balance of sauce and eggplant and the mozzarella cheese on top was melted to the right consistency. I was personally a huge fan of the dish. <br><br>Next we got the only chicken dish on the menu. This was my favorite dish we ordered (asides from dessert of course). The flavors were great and the chicken was cooked to the perfect temperature. I highly suggest this dish as well! We also ended up getting penne vodka and it was like any other penne vodka. Nothing bad or extraordinary about it.

For large groups (we had 8) most dishes are too small to have more than a small taste per person, so I'd recommend ordering 2. We loved the Brussels sprouts but everyone only got 1-2 sprouts. <br><br>2. Don't show up starving and be nice to the hostess. They ran over 35 minutes late on a reservation I made weeks in advance. Apparently they are known for this. The hostess (bless her) was very kind and did her best but was still overwhelmed. Remember she can't always directly affect this, so for her sake complain to the manager if you must let out your frustration. <br><br>(P.S. if management is reading this please do something about the way you pack your reservations in. Also, those two little tables off the side of the packed waiting room would be much better as waiting benches, everyone who saw that said they hoped they weren't theirs.)<br><br>3.

The manager, Alysia, also came by and was very welcoming as well. She was very well versed in her introduction to the different types  of prosciutto, as we had trouble deciding which one to try out. As customers, we were impressed, and her dedication to her job makes the vibe for us that much better. <br><br>The restaurant itself is very large.

Like other reviewer, I highly recommend them because I've seen them quote an hour to hour and a half on most friday nights. <br><br>Out of the items I have tried, I have enjoyed the beet and burrata salad, polenta fries, and artisan blend fondue the best. I love anything with burrata and their salad is no exception. The polenta fries are great and i love the red pepper salsa that they serve it with (I also love dipping them in the fondue). The fondue is delicious and for two people, it's plenty - I may get two orders if you have four or more though! I found the gnocchi and eggplant parmesan to be somewhat tasteless. The gnocchi at least had the pesto which added flavor, but I really did not enjoy the eggplant parmesan. The eggplant was thoroughly cooked through, which I like, but the sauce was lacking salt and flavor, which caused the entire dish to do the same. I've been meaning to try the pizzas, but haven't gotten around to it. For dessert, I've had the hot chocolate cake with italian gelato and the italian donuts. I expected a few donuts and you get a huge basket full which is awesome because who doesn't love extra donuts! The hot chocolate cake is so rich and decadent - absolutely delicious, and pairs well with the cold and creamy gelato. <br><br>The service has been fine  each time I've been there.

We dined no a Friday night and were seated on the patio. After about 20 minutes a server showed up and took our drink orders. Another 20 minutes went buy and another server brought us some bread but the drinks had yet to show up. I eventually commented and asked about the status of our drinks and 15 minutes later another server showed up with 2 of the 3 drinks we ordered. Our meal went on like this with continuous changes in servers and it even took 30 minutes to get the check let alone another 25 minutes to get my credit card back. For such a nice establishment the server confusion was very disappointing. <br><br>We tried the Caprese salad which was fantastic and absolutely fresh and I highly recommend it. We also the meatballs which I had to remind the server twice to receive and were fairly small and somewhat chewy. (I'm guessing they forgot about it and reheated them or something). As for the pasta we ordered the Cavatelli we asked for it to be spicy. The pasta itself was great and the sauce definitely tasted homemade however there was no spice and 15 minutes later some crushed red pepper was brought to the table. <br><br>Overall I was really looking forward to eating on the patio here and I do think they have a solid drink menu and great beer selection.

The main difference: the tapas style ordering. Honestly, I was confused by other reviewers on how to go about ordering, and looking around at other tables wasn't much help either! We ended up ordering two pasta dishes to share and then, still hungry, we ordered a third. But plus one dessert at the end, it ended up being too much for two people! <br><br>The good: I LOVE that this place is so gluten free friendly. Not only did they have gluten free pasta that could be used in any pasta dish, but a designated gluten free menu had more choices than I'd seen at possibly any Italian restaurant EVER. If pasta isn't your thing, there was a long list of gluten free meat dishes along with at least ten appetizers and five soup or salad options. Also, my boyfriend agreed with other claims that the tiramisu here is really darn good (although, confusingly, it's not on the menu!). <br><br>The bad: the service and quality on my one visit here was a little spotty. Our half-full water jug was taken away before we were finished eating, our silverware was cleared while we were waiting on another dish, and our waiter never followed up on more wine after we'd decided to do 1/4 liter \"to start.\" Our first two pasta dishes were sloppily plated, with one vastly different in size than the other. The Alfredo one was yucky. Then, we waited for a solid 25 minutes for our third pasta dish, and our waiter was even confused as to why it hadn't yet arrived at our table. Also, the wine, while cheap, wasn't served with wine glasses which was just kind of weird. <br><br>Overall, I'd love to give Quartino another shot, but at $75 for two people, I think I'll have to save up a bit before I do.

We were seated at a small table in the room that fronts State Street. The room was dark, cozy, and intimate-the perfect ambiance for our date night. I suggest trying to get a table in here! It's better than the main dining room, in my opinion.<br><br>We started with the dates wrapped in pancetta, delicious. Next was the wild arugula salad. It wasn't bad, but I was a tad underwhelmed. I was hoping there would be more farro. We then had the duck prosciutto. The prosciutto itself was great--salty and savory. It was served with a small pickled vegetable salad that was overly spicy and honestly, unnecessary. The shrimp dish was good, but the shrimp was overcooked. They weren't tender, as shrimp should be. <br><br>Now onto the highlights of the meal: pasta!! We had the tortellini and the orecchiette. The tortellini was served with Alfredo, parmesan, peas, and prosciutto and was literally to die for. It was clearly the highlight of the meal and one of the best pasta dishes I have had in quite some time. The orecchiette was served with a fennel sausage ragu and complimented and contrasted the tortellini well. Also, the pasta dishes here are quite large. I would say they are more entree sized than tapas sized.<br><br>And then dessert. If you are going to get only one dessert, get the Gran Coppa Quartino. I'm assuming it's what they're known for. It's vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate gelato served in a martini glass with fresh berries and a giant biscotti. It was fantastic and the presentation was beautiful. We also ordered the zeppole.

We each ordered the tomato soup to start, but they brought them out one by one, so that my sister was almost done with hers by the time mine arrived. That seemed really odd. The soup was really good with nice chunks of tomato floating in a thick tomato puree. <br><br>My sister also ordered a couple of veggie dishes and I ordered the Bianca Pizza, all of which came out relatively close together. My sister like her veggie items, but the potato puree she ordered was just too rich for her to eat much of it. My Bianca Pizza was ok, but not spectacular. They overdid it on the onions which would have been much better if they had been caramelized and the other ingredients, rosemary and chilis, were too sparse. I ended up taking most of it back to my hotel for breakfast and then ended up dumping most of the leftovers in the garbage because I just couldn't stomach more of it. <br><br>Our waiter took my sister's potato puree off the tab, which was nice. She hadn't actually complained about it and we would have been happy to pay for it. My sister gave me some cash to help cover her portion and I gave our waiter the cash and my credit card and he agreed to charge the difference between the bill and the cash tendered. When the credit card receipt was presented, the cash was gone and he had charged the entire amount of the bill to my card. I would like to think the best of people, but I kinda think he was hoping I wouldn't notice so he could pocket the cash. He did rerun my card, so I'm hoping it went through correctly and there are not duplicate charges.

However, I was not much of a fan of the tomato sauce; I appreciated their attempts to go beyond the typical cocktail sauce, but I felt like the sauce was missing the sour tang to balance out the slightly more rich nature of the breading.<br><br>Pesto gnocchi: I love love love pesto, so naturally I went straight for this. However, I was very disappointed to find the sauce far too salty, the gnocchi doughy and too chewy, and the vegetables a major distraction from the pesto flavors.<br><br>Paparadelle: I liked this one slightly better than the pesto--the noodles were a nice texture, and the tomato based sauce went very well with the tender braised beef. I found this dish also very salty, but not as bad as the pesto. <br><br>Tiramisu: This was by far the best dish of the night. Extremely light, slightly sweet, and very well balanced out with the more bitter chocolate and espresso flavors. <br><br>Overall, was quite unimpressed with the food.

First of all-it's a large restaurant with bright lighting, so more like a family restaurant rather than a date night. We were shoved in a back table feeling really claustrophobic to our surroundings. Everything is shared small plates so we ordered eggplant Parmesan, broccoli rabe, gnocchi, and porcini and truffle Risotto. The eggplant Parmesan dish came out piping hot and no one warned my husband. He burnt himself. The dish tasted great though, and the marinara was really fresh. The next dish that came out was the broccoli rabe. It was fantastic-definitely our favorite. Then the Risotto... we LOVE risotto! Theirs however was terrible. The rice was undercooked and the porcini mushroom dirt overpowered the dish. There were several gritty bites as if they put the rehydrated water into the dish and didn't discard the dirt debris. Lastly the gnocchi-it had undercooked potatoes and green beans that overpowered the dish and the gnocchi tasted grainy like it needed another minute to cook. <br><br>We gave the place a 3 for the broccoli, eggplant, the wine, and the service. The ambiance and the other 2 dishes were bad enough that we probably won't be back.

I was disappointed in the pizza, there was not much flavor. I've never had to salt pizza before. It was pretty flavorless, and considering what was on it I expected a lot of flavor. I won't order pizza there ever again. The pasta was very good but also needed salt, which it shouldn't. My mom who was with me ordered the chicken and fondue. The fondue was amazing but her chicken was so dry she could barely chew or swallow it. It was also pretty flavorless to. It got sent back. For dessert I ordered the chocolate fondue with strawberries and my mom ordered the hot chocolate cake. Her cake was not good at all, it had a very strange taste and was pretty flavorless.

The other salad we had which was like radishes, beets, carrots... Soooo gross. It was so vinegary, tough, and the flavors did not work together. BOLOGNESE- this I was told to order but it was clear no one in our group really liked it. The sauce was VERY sweet and lacked any real sofrito flavor or if u like marinara bolognese it did not have that going for it either... GNOCCHI- ok the arugula pesto is really pushing it. It tastes like pure arugula which any of my salad eating friends out there knows tastes like DIRT plain. They should know a normal pesto w basil, garlic, and pine nuts would much better serve their hand rolled gnocchis.

I live in Pittsburgh and have literally thought about this restaurant every day since my return a week ago. So where do I begin....<br><br>My co-workers and I were looking for a great restaurant for dinner after we had spent the day traveling and working. Those of us who still had battery life on our iPhones were searching away on Yelp and Urbanspoon, trying to find a great spot for dinner. The first place that we found was small and had a 1-2 hour wait, so we decided to find another place.<br><br>We were exhausted and starving when we finally stumbled into Quartino. It was a Monday night, and the restaurant was pretty deserted. We were quickly seated on the upstairs balcony. (Yes, we were lucky enough to be in Chicago when it was 68 degrees in December!) They tried to seat all five of us at a tiny table, but I asked if we could push two tables together to have more room. I think the staff anticipated that we would just order a small glass of wine and tiny appetizer to share... but they had no idea of the appetite we had worked up all day. We were ready for some serious ordering and table filling.<br><br>Service was prompt and polite. The waiter presented our wine in a very formal manner, which I thought was interesting -- and a little awkward. However, once I began to eat, the food was so delicious that I entered an Italian food coma, ignoring all that was going on around me, including the fact that I didn't realize the balcony was completely filled until we left at 7:30pm.<br><br>The great thing about trying new restaurants with a group is that you get to try so many different things! We tried -- Margherita Pizza, Salumeria Tasting, White Bean & Garlic Spread, Caprese Salad, Gnocchi, Cavatelli, Tagliatelle alla Bolognese, Tortellini, Penne alla Vodka, and Beef Short Ribs. All of our dishes were at least good while many dishes ranked in the excellent-and-still-dreaming-about-it-a-week-later category.<br><br>I highly recommend ordering pasta here. Every pasta that came out seemed to top the previous. The Cavatelli in particular was a table favorite. As a pasta lover, my love of pasta is why I'm dreaming of returning in the future. I was disappointed in the Margherita Pizza -- it was a bit cold and bland -- but was told later by friends that the poor pizza quality is more of an exception than the rule. Apparently, they normally have fantastic pizza. I'll have to order a different type next time!<br><br>Most importantly, I can't forget the wine! My table ordered a bottle of red and a carafe of white and only spent about $50 or $60 for both.

A friend suggested Quartino despite her fiance's reluctance to try such a touristy spot, but mannn, are we glad we went. This was technically Dinner #2, but really, who's counting? The spaghetti was so simple but SO amazing. The pizza had a nice consistency and good flavor. The grilled octopus was a delight. The gnocchi was a little too salty but the pesto kept us going back for more. The shrimp risotto was delicious as well. Every dish we shared was wonderful. I will definitely try to stop by the next time I visit!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "If tapas, and Italian food are your thing, I'd highly suggest Quartino as a spot in Chicago to come and try. What's great about tapas is that there's so much variety and the dishes are small. This offers a lot of food tasting, and is really great to socialize with.<br><br>I came here with two of my other friends, and got seating right away because this spot is LARGE. There's a big first floor, and just as large second story. It's quite unbelieveable. Having such a vast menu, I would just suggest you not overly think about it, and just order what you think sounds good & have at it. That's the best way to do it!<br><br>Foods don't come in any order. It's what ever is cooked and it just comes out. For example our sampler plate of meat and cheeses came last while the pasta and baked stuff came first. Odd, but not bad at all!<br><br>Off our dinner adventure, I would recommend the following:<br>1) Eggplant Parmigiana - I'm enjoy eating eggplant, and when breaded, I love it even more! Rich with flavor. Excellent!<br>2) Steamed Clams - YES! Must get. Small clams, delicious in flavor. Rich! Save your bread and dip it in the juices. So much yum in a plate!<br>3) Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo - Pasta ribbons with braised beef in tomato sauce. As a pasta lover, this was devine. The braised beef was so soft. Very simple and well made.<br>4) Veal Meatball Slider - Different and good. Eat this when it comes out and don't wait on it because it will get cold!<br><br>Other tidbits -- if you are a Neopolitan Pizza lover, this spot may also be for you! The options for their pizza's were pretty large, so I'm going to assume that this is their bread and butter on top of tapas actually. For a couple that comes in, this may be the way to go if tapas isn't your thing.<br><br>Wine options galore. Middle of the road pricing in my opinion. Not cheap, but not too expensive. We had 6-7 dishes, myself a 1/2 Sangria, and my other friend 1/2 red wine, the total came out to $130 not including tip. $35-40/head ~ can't complain when the food is great!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/n-3PJWV7Jxgy_X0IvaiHjg/168s.jpg", "caption": "wine's galore"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Came here for dinner as it was right next to our hotel.

Pieces of delicately sliced duck prosciutto were scattered across and baked to perfection. If you like bacon, you would like duck prosciutto. The onions were there but barely noticeable.

Awesome!"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "I was planning a birthday celebration for my extended family (16 people) and Quartino Ristorante came very highly recommended.  After deciding that we wouldn't spend enough to warrant a private room ($2000 minimum) we booked a table in the main dining room for 6:30 on a Friday night.  Things started out poorly when our table wasn't ready when we arrived but a few of us headed to the bar to kill time (the rest hung out by the door...not the most convenient waiting area) and about 20 minutes later we were seated. Unfortunately, the table set up was more appropriate for 14 people than 16 so I went to speak with the host.  To their credit, they said that they would take care of things right away and about 5 minutes later, after a table next to us freed up, they pushed it over and we settled in, more comfortably this time.<br><br>While a bit irritating, I put the initial issues down to the fact that we were at a busy Chicago restaurant on a Friday night...unfortunately, things did not get better.  I had pre-ordered 3 Salumeria tasting (antipasti) plates.  A few minutes after we sat down the first plate arrived.  Maybe 5 minutes after that, the second plate arrived.  Probably another 6-7 minutes later , the 3rd plate arrived. So it was almost 15 minutes before some people had food!  These were pre-ordered and consisted of a mix of charcuterie, cheese and assorted pre-made vegetable antipasti (which were good)...there was no reason that all of the plates could not have been prepared and delivered to the table at once.  Very strange.<br><br>Then we ordered the mains.  The waiter warned us that the dishes would be brought out as they became available...which was fine.  That said, I was not prepared for the fact that my linguine with clams came out about 3 minutes later...and probably 7-10 minutes before anyone else got food.  I guess I could have understood it if everyone at our table who ordered linguine with clams was served at the same time, but that was not the case.  The best I could figure is that they had an extra one from someone else's order so they gave it to me. Needless to say I was finished before most people at the table were served.<br><br>Again, all of this would have been forgiven if the food was good, but it was not.  My linguine was way over cooked and bland.  My wife's shrimp risotto tasted like lightly seasoned rice that they put a couple of shrimp on top of.  I had a slice of my nephew's pepperoni pizza and it could have been something from the freezer section.  My daughter said that her tagliatelle alla Bolognese was also meh.  I have been to Italy numerous times and I know what good Italian food tastes like...this was not it (To the people who have written Yelp reviews saying that this is the best Italian food in Chicago, I have news for you - it is not even the best Italian food in River North).<br><br>On the plus side, the wait staff were competent and friendly.  They generously gave our table an extra pizza that was going to go to waste in the kitchen and they took a soda off of the bill that my young nephew ordered but didn't like. And the prices are very reasonable (most pasta and mains are between $11 and $15)...although the portions are not huge (the waiter said that things were family style but they were a little small to share between 2 people).<br><br>Despite what I had heard about this being a chef-driven Italian restaurant, I would categorize it as more of a mass market Italian-American restaurant minus the overwhelming portions. Food is okay but not especially memorable...certainly not if you have ever eaten in a real Italian trattoria or enoteca.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Really great restaurant with a large variety of food selections.

I will say that he loved these and thought they were very good. <br><br>We then ordered the veal meatballs, which were served in tomato sauce with basil and topped with ricotta. This dish was quite good, but again I felt it was missing some flavor. It also became cold quite quickly. Neither me nor my husband were impressed with this dish. <br><br>Next was shrimp with garlic, red chili, pinot grigio, E.V.O.O. and lemon juice. Very fresh, bright, and acidic with nice garlicky notes. Again, a solid dish but nothing special. <br><br>The gnocchi with green beans and arugula pesto was my favorite of the night. It was interesting and had a nice mix of flavors and textures. <br><br>We also really enjoyed the campania pizza, which had a very nice, tender and slightly chewy crust and was topped with fonduta, ricotta, roasted cherry tomatoes, and basil leaves. This was a very good pizza if you are looking for something a little different. I really liked the oven roasted tomatoes, it gave the pizza an intense tomato flavor. <br><br>We finished the meal with the zeppoles, which were deep fried dough balls dusted in powdered sugar and served with a side of honey and dark chocolate sauce. These were very good, but also very rich. They were excellent with the hot, strong coffee we ordered to accompany them. <br><br>Like I said, this place serves solidly good food, and you won't regret eating here.

She didn't take my plate to correct the mistake, instead she brought me out some cold chopped chicken with some cold pesto sauce over it. So I was technically eating cold chicken and cold gnocchi once I poured it on top. I didn't even eat the chicken since it was so gross. We then decided to get some ice cream and the waitress brought us lemon and raspberry sorbet. Don't get me wrong, it was good but I saved her the trouble of having to toss the sorbet out, so we ate it. The waitress then brought my husband a piece of a complimentary biscotti...in a very uncomfortable way. I have to say she was a bit too friendly with my husband, she even asked him before we left what was on the agenda for the night...it was almost close to midnight! I'm sorry but when you're on a dinner date, as a waitress you should be more respectful of the fact that your own customer's wife is sitting right there! And just observing the way she was inappropriately talking to your husband...so unprofessional.

While I'm used to larger Italian size portions, I found that Quartino's portions were just right for one person (if you don't share of course!). I ordered the Linguine with clams in white sauce and it was the perfect blend of clams and pasta. Going with a big group always has its benefits, it gives you the chance to try more. I had several bites of the Tuscan Sausage Risotto and Cavatelli. The risotto was good, but the Cavatelli was amazing!

On the other hand, we received abundant apologies from one of the restaurant group's managers Alysia. In terms of post-dinner customer service, this place deserves more than two stars for their effort to change our impression. But, for the dinner-as-experienced, this place still earns a Yelp \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"<br><br>We ate here late, after missing the kitchen at another restaurant during our recent visit to Chicago. It wasn't our first pick and a veteran of many a late-night eat, I tend to keep expectations fairly low no-matter the star-level because, well, staff get tired, people want to go home, etc, etc and so forth. <br><br>Even so, our visit here started out reasonable. They have outdoor seating and we were seated back towards what *is* an active driveway. Okay, not ideal. But, did I mention we were extremely hungry? Our server explained the menu to us - Italian tapas, communal serving, no control of the order dishes come to the table. Fine, fine, sounds good to us. But, the initial ordering was the beginning and end of consistent interaction with the staff.<br><br>To start we ordered, three dishes for the table. One broccoli rabe side order, one fettucine alfredo, one stracci di grano arso. As we had never been here before and were unsure of the portion size to anticipate, we kept the initial order light. <br><br>The broccoli rabe came out speedily enough. Parts of it were burnt to a crisp, not charred, while other parts were slimey. It wasn't great, it wasn't good, but, it wasn't awful either. Just inconsistent in texture in a non-pleasing way. Eh, fine, onwards. <br><br>Second order: was plunked down by a woman who seemed ridiculously harried to get back to wherever she had came from. It felt like she threw it down on the table and disappeared. This was the fettucine alfredo. My grandmother always said fettucine alfredo is not a \"true italian\" dish, it's a bastard american cousin. Even so, this second dish was hardly anything American or Italian. The noodles weren't 'al dente' they were just straight undercooked and clumped together in a fashion you'd see from someone who had only today learned to cook pasta. Parts of them were hard, parts of them were soft. My dining partner said the sauce tasted \"doughy\", like in a rush they had thickened it with too much flour. And to make perhaps the most pedantic complaint of all (so pedantic I'm cringing at myself), these noodles were pappardelle. There are philosophical arguments about what is fettuccine, what is tagliatelle, what is pappardelle and what belongs in fettucine alfredo - as they're all wider-flat noodles. But, what I can tell you is a super-thick undercooked-over-floured sauce is pretty unpleasant with partially cooked thicker-than-the-average-fettucine noodles all congealed into an inedible clump. This dish wasn't pleasing at all. But, as I said before, we were hungry and it was late.<br><br>Third plate: The third plate never came. An apology about the third plate never coming did come. But, by then we had pretty much formed the impression something here was broken tonight. Because of the way their ordering process works you really have no way of knowing if the kitchen is backed up and taking a long time or, as in our case, they've forgotten you completely and sent your dish to another table by mistake. <br><br>Pros: <br>-Their kitchen was open when we were visiting<br><br>Cons: <br>-In the spirit of being true to yelp, we didn't have a very good meal here. Or really enough to count as a meal here. We ordered three dishes, were served two barely edible ones and a third was forgotten about by the staff and/or misdirected to another table.<br><br> That said, we were abundantly compensated for our time and negative experience with apologies, comped half-dinner and a gift card to come back and try them again next time. <br><br>I've only very rarely seen such active image management at anywhere other than the finest restaurant in New York. For being so attentive post-dinner they really deserve all the stars. However, the whole experience did make me wonder if they retain such high yelp rating through effective 'damage control' or if we really did catch the fluke-of a fluke-of a fluke, of an evening. <br><br>We have a gift card. I can't say whether or not we'll be back next time we're in the Chicago area.

I could definitely eat these again...unfortunately that was the best part of the meal.<br><br>- Veal Meatball Sliders - The meatball itself was dry; with no sauces or spreads on the slider, it made for a pretty unimpressive slider. I wish the giardiniera was at least a tad spicier. <br><br>- Asparagus Risotto - This was the most confusing and most disappointing dish. I'm sorry to say that I'm curious as to whether previous reviewers have had good risotto before. I get it - good risottos are hard and a lot of restaurants fall short, but I've rarely tasted such a bad one. A good risotto should be saucy enough to move & spread once you scoop it onto a plate, but thick enough to not run everywhere (think hot lava). This risotto was FAR too liquidy and ran like soup. It was underseasoned, which I imagine isn't hard if it's more watery than a perfect cheesy, creamy, buttery texture. Also, whatever cheese they used lended a gritty texture rather than a smooth one.

The food is not mind blowing or phenomenally good. It does not give you a wow factor but it's decent enough.<br><br>Beef carpaccio:<br>Absolutely bland and tasteless. We've had a lot of carpaccio elsewhere and the slices of rare meat should at least have natural flavor. The slices were also all stuck together as we tried to lift some of the plate.<br><br>White bean spread:<br>Also absolutely bland. I never salt my food at restaurants but just to experiment if the spread would taste better, I sprinkled some salt and pepper over it. It was a tad bit better.<br><br>Pappardelle with short rib sauce:<br>Fresh pasta should always have the delicate chewy texture compared to the typical texture of dried pasta like spaghetti and linguine. The pappardelle definitely did not have that chewy texture and tasted more like dried pasta. While the short rib sauce was tasty, but it tasted shallow rather than having depth.<br><br>Veal osso buco:<br>The meat was extremely tender which is the only positive thing about the dish. The veal itself did not taste like it absorbed any of the sauce. Oddly, the veal had a \"sterile\" taste.

My family loved everything that we ordered except the polenta fries which I thought the restaurants signature thing. I should also mention we'd never had polenta before so maybe I'm not the best to judge. Also the dishes come out as they are ready,  not all at one, which I kind of liked. The only down side to this place is that is was so incredibly noisey (we went on a busy Friday night) we couldn't even have conversations across the table.

Granted, it was a Thursday night, but there weren't too many people in this very rustic, authentic-looking \"Italian tapas\" restaurant.

Subtle in taste but rich in texture, we quickly sopped it up. It came out very quickly as well, and as two hungry college guys, we finished it right away. Luckily, the risotto came out soon after. The porcini was definitely strong and the risotto was cooked pretty well, so no complaints there. We definitely wanted more of it, however, as was a running theme throughout our meal; although it was a dinner for two, the portions are rather small if you're feeling voracious, so either pregame your meal or plan on getting an extra app or two. <br><br>The beef filets were very nicely cooked, a nice char adding a requisite amount of crunch while the meat itself was a solid medium-rare. The accompanying sauce was a bit too salty for my taste, but it really wasn't too bad.

Perfectly pink, sliced paper thin, and a lot of shaved reggiano cheese and some shaved celery. <br><br>The linguini with clams was solid, the pasta was perfectly al dente, and the sauce had plenty of butter and garlic. Needed a little S&P to balance it out. The Artesian sausage and peppers was pretty good. I liked the red sauce as it wasn't too heavy or overwhelming. The sausage had a pretty distinctive fennel flavor; it was fine, but I've had some better. The shrimp risotto was nice and hearty and believe me, they did not skimp on the shrimp. The zucchini and sun dried tomatoes complemented the shrimp but didn't distract from it, so the dish was well-balanced. Also, the Tucan kale salad may hvae been the best surprise of the meal. Organic cherry tomatoes, cucumber, onion, and plenty of pecorino cheese made  this the best kale dish I've ever had. this is a must-get. The rigatoni wasn't too good though. It had burrata cheese and a lamb ragu, so it was a darker red sauce. I enjoyed the addition of the lamb, but the combination of flavors was a little too heavy and the dish just had a salty flavor to it. For dessert, we did zeppole. They were incredibly light and airy.

It was an awesome experience getting to try different dishes with my partner!<br><br>We called a few minutes before getting there, around 8 and asked them of availability. They are super popular so they told us the inside area was full for the night but we could try and grab a seat at the patio/bar. We decided to try our luck and behold, the moment we got there we found a perfect spot open! Overall, I'd suggest reservations or getting there earlier, or being lucky like us haha!<br><br>environment: cute! We sat outside near the inside dining area which was perfect. It was far enough from the street but at the same time we had the city outdoor vibe. The inside decor was a bit eccentric but in a good way! like a proud Italian restaurant. <br><br>food: great overall! tbh i'm not a HUGE Italian fan (i know everyones shuddering) but my partner is and I wanted to make her happy. But actually the food was really good! I enjoyed all the little dishes we ordered with my favorite being the veal skirt steak & the clam linguine! Again, the experience to try a bunch of little plates is awesome! They let you do half order on almost everything so we ordered close to 8 dishes!<br><br>service: we had a very nice & sweet server, Kat, and another guy Joe G who was just so friendly, that he also was our server haha! It was clearly a long day for Kat, but despite this she was so positive, helpful, and sweet! she was very patient in showing us the menu and checked up on us the perfect amount. Joe G ended up serving our wine since Kat was a bit swamped and he was so friendly that we ended up talking a bit. He had a positive attitude and was giving us suggestions on what to do/sights to see in Chicago. He checked up on us and also gave us great recommendations on the menu.<br><br>After eating here, we met some Chicagians who asked us where we went for dinner. After telling them we went to Quartino they called us true Chicagoians. Although we are not true Chicagoains, we definitely felt like we ate at a landmark of Chicago. Our Chicago experience would not have been the same if we didn't come to this restaurant and the combination of great service and food means we will definitely come again when we're in the Windy City. :)", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "great food and amazing service.

Baked eggplant parmesan layers with tomato sauce topped with melted mozzarella cheese. Just wish they gave us a little more! Extremely flavorful and the cheese stretched across the table!<br><br>--Mushroom Risotto ($11.50)--<br>Personally I'm not a fan of risotto. This risotto was nothing special.. it was bland, mushy, and a bit heavy. All of us salted each bite!<br><br>--Brodetto Ai Frutti Di Mare ($15)--<br>A hearty seafood soup containing shrimp, clams, octopus, calamari, and white fish. It was a very fishy tomato based soup - which I personally love! The garlic bread went perfectly with all the hearty seafood! <br><br>--Quattro Stagioni Pizza ($12)--<br>The pizza are fairly big - 8 slices! The Quattro pizza was a thin pizza topped with artichokes, roasted peppers, grilled zucchini, and portobello mushrooms. Delicious!!!<br><br>We had a great night!

All the pastas and desserts we've tried receive top marks. Our reservation that day was to celebrate a birthday (mine) but we had just lost a pet, and in no mood to celebrate.

I hadn't meant to mention anything else but the verbal vomit came out and it was too late to delete the message. The service here is always outstanding but that day, they went above and beyond. It was a busy day but they reserved a quiet corner for us, helpful when I went teary-eyed, and had the semi-privacy to wipe them away in peace.

It's not the new kid on the block but it warrants being my lucky review number double 5 as it's worth 5 gems times 2! I've been here many times but it's one of my very fave, go-to places in Chicago, especially when I'm feelin' bad & carby! You cannot go to Quartino & not overindulge in some serious carb-overload, ain't happenin'! Don't even try to resist, work it off tomorrow!<br><br>I've never had a bad meal or tried anything I didn't like at Quartino. Whoa! I know, a rare statement comin' from this biznitch! You can customize anything on the menu at Quartino & no one bats an eye! Sub it, swap it, add it, hold it, halfzies, whole-size...you ask, they're game! Everything on the menu is designed to share & can be ordered as half or whole-order, including bottles o'wine! So you can & tote should sample a lil o'everything! First, you must get the polenta fries with red bell pepper salsa dippin' sauce. They come in a 3-teaser or an 8-ball amount. They're OMG, fried indescribable stix o'crack, my fave lil app here! Also, erbody gets a loaf o'hot, crusty, Italian bread!<br><br>Any of the salads at Quartino are friggin' awesome. If you like kale, you'll luv the Tuscan Kale Salad. It's got roasted butternut squash, sweet-n-sour onion, borlotti beans & of course lotsa, gemmy kale, duh! I had this salad on my last visit & it was supa fresh, tangy & a kale of a way to start your meal! The Shaved Spring salad is another gem fave!<br><br>For veggie side dishes, I heart the brussel sprouts that are roasted with EVOO & are crispy & insanely good! I also luv the roasted peppers, a mix o'multi-colored bell peppas roasted in EVVO. <br><br>I'm not a big fan o'meatballs but you should get some o'these guys. My fave are the Polpette al sugo di pomodoro: veal meatballs in organic tomato sauce w/fresh basil & house-made ricotta. Um, these balls are amazeballz! <br><br>You can't go wrong with any of the pasta dishes here either. Stracchi di Grano Arso is a gemmy, vegetarian pasta dish: Broccoli rabe, tomato, onion, garlic, red chili, EVOO & bursting with friggin' flava! If you're feelin' clammy, you can't beat Linguine w/clams: EVOO, red chili, Pinot Grigio & red sauce. The noodles are perfectly al dente with robust sauce & nice lil clammies!<br><br>For dessert, I like a scoop o'gelato. The gelato is creamy, smooth & the flavors are all gemliciously on point! I usually get lemon gelato cuz it's refreshin' after a big carby meal! If you wanna super, spesh dessert get Panino al Gelato Limone: lemon cream gelato sandwich w/lemon curd, whipped cream, & lemon chips. It's big enough to share & it's like eatin' a light, fluffy, OMG lemon cloud sent from above!<br><br>Ok, I saved the best for last & the reason I always come back to Quartino for more! My weakness & fave kinda pizza is traditional, \"Neapolitan-style pizze\". I don't eat 'em that often, but when I do I wanna make it count! I eat & try 'em all over, but I still like Quartino's Neapolitan-style 'zas da best! Quartino has a variety o'yummy pizze options to choose from or ya can customize one to your liking! My fave is the Vegetarina Pizze: asparagus, cauliflower, zucchini, eggplant, wild arugula & add mushrooms. My other fave is the Quattro Staggiano. The pies are about 12\" & are big enough to feed 1-2 people. The crust in the middle is super thin & soft but the outer crust is an uneven, bubbly ring that has a perfect, chewy-crunch to it. It has just the right amount of tangy/garlicky, tomato sauce & isn't overpowered by a ton o'cheese but is packed with uber, fresh veggies on top, just the way I heart mia pizza pies! Seriously, you're gonna luv any o'the pizzes here if ya like this kinda 'za! <br><br>Quartino is upbeat, lively & always packed. You can make a rez on Yelp or Open Table or just walk-in & grab a seat at the bar. Quartino is huge with dining rooms & a bar on both floors & also has an outside patio. It's casual-trendy & the ambience is rustic-sheik. The service here is accomodating, quick & to the point. I'm happy to yelp all the servers I've had at Quartino have all been informative of the menu & helpful with recs if needed. (Gem Rule#1: Know the Menu or at least fake it! Idk is NOT an acceptable answer! I hate it when I go to places that break this rule!) <br><br>So if you're visitin' Chicago or it's been awhile, I highly recommend goin' to Quartino to try a lil or a lotta different, gemazin' Italian bites & ya must get one o'my fave Neapolitan pies & an order o'polenta fries! I do like tryin' other places for Neapolitan 'zas & other Italian fare, but when all other dinner plans go South, get 86'd, are a no-go or nothin' else sounds good, Quartino is my fall back cuz he's da best, knows how to treat me & knows just what I like! He's always waitin' on State Street to take me back in & show me a good time & feed me a fuggin' molto bene meal...

We started with the sundried tomato soup ($3.75) which came in a very small dish but tasted tolerable. I ordered the porcini mushroom risotto ($14.75) and BF ordered the gnocchi ($10.75). The risotto came out first--a nasty mess of mushy gray slop which I finished out of extreme hunger alone--that's not much to boast of, however, because all in all, there were about nine spoonfuls--I'll liken eating them to going through each of Dante's circles of hell.<br><br>Next came the gnocchi--a true nightmare of incompatible tastes. A tiny platter with gnocchi absolutely drowning in oil, pesto, and (apparently) arugula and potato, this dish tasted off immediately and also smelled foul. The bartender came by and asked if everything was alright. I explained that the gnocchi tasted awful--and tried to articulate exactly what was \"off\" about it, but I was so overwhelmed by the competing options that I just gave up and left it at \"honestly, it tastes bad.\" In response, he told us to \"keep eating because there is some good garlicky stuff in there\"...I mean, I don't even know where to go with that. We picked at it some more out of sheer politeness, and we really shouldn't have but my boyfriend, bless his little heart, is too damn nice. I couldn't go through with it. He came by again and asked if we wanted to get something else. After tasting those two dishes, though, I wasn't sure we could survive another go around. We politely declined and asked for the check. <br><br>When he dropped it off, he told us that he'd taken the gnocchi off of the tab. Right move, but too little, too late. When someone complains about the food, you don't give them a hard time and tell them to keep eating; you apologize and offer them something else. At that point, we were visibly upset and still hungry (we ate maybe 50% of the food that came out). We paid, tipped for the bad service (out of principle alone) and left. <br><br>And as a final note: there's a bit of humor to every bad situation because the whole time in my head, while this was playing out, I kept imagining Gordon Ramsey just absolutely freaking out. <br><br>Gordon, on the off chance you're reading this, you may want to give this place a shot.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QFwrEJc52n2PPK5B-yGi0A/348s.jpg", "caption": "Goop.

And we all salted them. <br>* polenta fries - rather flavorless. All of us reached for the salt, and half of them went back to the kitchen<br>* gnocchi - really, really bad. The flavor was off, the texture was chewy... We sent more than half of it back to the kitchen.

It's perfect for multiple occasions, a nice date with someone, a casual get-together, or a group outting.

When we sat down, plates of Roasted Beet & Walnut Salad, Assorted Bruschette and Polenta Fries were already waiting for us. The beet salad was earthy, not overly sweet, and sprinkled with walnuts and fresh ricotta salata. A trio of bruschette were topped with peppery arugula, warm Sicilian eggplant and portobello mushrooms (each separate) and, of course, cheese. These warm, crisp toasts served as a much better start to the meal than a basket of bread. By themselves, the polenta fries were a little under-salted and under-seasoned; but use them to mop up heaps of red sauce, and all is forgiven.<br><br>Paste was next, and the dishes in this course were especially comforting: Gnocchi with Arugula Pesto and Spaghetti con Pomodoro. The gnocchi were soft, pillowy and just a tad chewy (as they should be) sitting in a shallow pool of pesto alongside green beans and potatoes. Spaghetti con Pomodoro isn't a complicated dish, but Quartino's Pomodoro is a light, lovely fusion of tomato and basil. The Pesce e Specialita - for us, Salmon and Chicken - fell a little flat. The fish was dry and chewy, which I've never had before in salmon. Dolci, though, made up for it.<br><br>Dessert was Tiramisu - a layered, soaked cake treat that's not for the faint of appetite. An amalgamation of flavors, including coffee, cocoa and mascarpone, Quartino's Tiramisu is almost too much, but then you share with a friend (or two), and it's suddenly just the right amount of rum, ladyfingers and cocoa to cap off a meal.

I looked into getting a private room for us (through private events section of website), but due to keeping costs down, ended up with reserving a table in the dining area.

Actually, that same night, I think we saw about three or four other tables with bachelorette party people. <br><br>+ Even though portions are small (think tapas style), I always leave like I ate one big meal. My parents were in town for Thanksgiving. My dad liked the idea of small dishes because he thinks he's gaining a belly. Whatever, dad. He liked it so much we came back...three freakin' times in a week. In our defense, we didn't order the same dishes each time. The favorites though were the shrimp risotto, polenta fries (my personal fave), the not so spicy salami (name escapes me), and fried calamari.<br><br>If you don't like loud places or sit somewhat too close to the next table, this might not be for you.

The scoops of lemon cream gelato were very generous and lemony and delicious, but the sandwiches were made of sponge cake (a little firmer, I think) and they were SO GOOD. They were soaked in lemon curd and topped with whipped cream... we talked about this dessert for the whole way back to campus. This is definitely a must-order dish.<br><br>PRETTY GOOD (would probably order again): The pappardelle with braised beef. The beef wasn't a standout for me, but I loved the toothiness of the pappardelle strips, which were cooked perfectly. The veal meatballs in tomato/raisiny sauce were also really good because the sauce was a touch sweet and the meatballs were very tender and well-seasoned.<br><br>AVERAGELY GOOD (probably would skip next time): The calamari was a little too oily and heavy and salty for our taste, but I can see why so many people on Yelp love it.

Unfortunately, the salad was drowning in salad dressing so that you could barely taste any of the other ingredients. We needed the orange to almost combat the overpowering  dressing.

There were a lot of orange seeds that made them hard to pick out when mixed among the small grain rice and hazelnuts and made for an unpleasant bite of bitterness. The tagliatelle again would have been good if they had cooked the pasta properly because the bolognese sauce was nice. There were lumps of noodles that didn't separate during the cooking process. Tigah hates clumpy pasta! The beef filets were ordered medium which means pink in center but came out well-done. The shrimp did not taste fresh and were overdone giving them an unpleasant rubbery texture.  Overall, it felt like a meal that had all the components to be good but was prepared by an amateur - Overdressed salad, clumpy noodles and overcooked proteins.

Bravo.<br><br>Our team arrives here at 6 PM on a Thursday and we were still missing two folks. They told us that they would seat us once our party arrived which I did not mind and felt was fair. Finally the last two members joined the party and we were brought into the main dining room of the bustling restaurant. It is quite packed in here and there is not a whole lot of wiggle room as a warning to folks. Since it is in fact pretty packed, the noise level is on the loud side as well. The décor of the joint was inviting and casual which was reinforced by the tables placed closely together. It made it seem like one large family at a dinner table ready to consume a delicious meal. I was a fan of the ambiance.<br><br>The service was also super friendly. The waiter was very knowledgeable over all of the food including what vino to order based on what type of vino we were looking for. They were attentive throughout the meal even though each waiter seemed to be waiting on multiple tables. <br><br>We ordered a ton of plates to share which included the veal meatballs, the Bolognese, penne ala vodka, the margherita pizza, and the parpadelle. Everything was delicious honestly. A solid joint and definitely hearty enough to share with folks. The penne alla vodka was one of my more favorites and the meatballs were great as well. I was worried that they would be a bit bland but they were flavorful so definitely a plus. Everyone loved the small plate experience as we were all able to try multiple different things without getting full quickly.<br><br>This is definitely a great place to bring a group of folks to spend some time bonding with folks.

Another main course dish I had was the beef short rib.  It was cooked and seasoned well and had some type of pesto sauce draped over the top that was excellent.  The beginning of the meal had plenty of bread, and lots of olive oil/Parmesan mix, and balsamic and crushed red.  <br><br>Service- Waiter was exceptionally informative and recommended the blood orange Italian soda (yum) and the beef short rib (yum yum)", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Food - OK, tasty <br>Service - Friendly, but a little slow<br>Ambiance - Horrible <br>Noise level - Horrible -so loud you have to shout<br><br>Since we have never been able to book a reservation on a Friday night we decided to just walk in and were actually seated immediately and escorted upstairs.  We were  initially going to be seated in a large room but there were so many large parties in it we couldn't hear anything.  We then were seated in a small room and noticed a huge table set for about 20 people directly next to us and asked to be moved downstairs but the host said the party would not arrive for 30 minutes yet and there were no other tables available. <br><br>We went ahead and ordered an appetizer pizza and it was lukewarm.  A hostess stopped by a little later on and asked how everything was and she was appalled when we told her that the food was lukewarm and quickly whisked the partially eaten pizza  away even though we told her to just leave it.  We thought she might return with another one but not the case.  We placed our entree order only to be inundated by a very large and LOUD party celebrating a birthday.  <br><br>There was no room for my seat as the large party was getting seated and I had to move right right against my husband.  It was still so noisy we literally could not even converse.  We finally flagged a manager who was very apologetic and found us a table downstairs where we could finish our meal.  We noticed that other diners in the room did not care for the noise either but it was super noisy everywhere upstairs.  The ambiance was horrible especially for smaller groups.  The location downstairs was packed with large tables too but at least one party was leaving so it helped cut down on the noise.  We noticed another small party being seated and their space was so tight we knew what they were in for.  <br><br>The service was courteous and the manager really wanted to smooth things over.  The remaining entrees were actually very tasty but the whole incident upstairs really ruined our evening.  <br><br>Quartino's is obviously a very popular place but it seems more interested in packing people in like sardines vs creating a nice dining atmosphere where you don't have to shout to be heard.  We were told that they serve 700 people a day so it gives you an idea of the insanity.  Dinner time is definitely not the time to go if you want to enjoy a normal meal where you can converse.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Quartino was a nice local choice in the Near North River neighborhood near our hotel.

I will not even be able to tell you everything I tried but I will give a nice outline. The pizzas were my favorite part and the more toppings, the better. I like the spinach salad and the organic tomatoes. The pastas were ok and the charcuterie was not too bad. Overall, there was a lot more good than not so good.

The staff are all wearing soccer jerseys and the decorations enhance the Italian atmosphere - you can even read different Italian newspapers while you wait!<br><br>We started off with a complimentary serving of bread. The bread was not appetizing at all. It was cold and seemed somewhat stale, and it actually reduced my appetite. Not the best start to a meal.<br><br>Our first dish was the baby spinach salad with pears, walnuts, and ricotta. The salad was nothing impressive at all. Super easy to replicate, and here you are spending $8 on it. Get another salad instead.<br><br>Next was the duck prosciutto pizza. It's fairly well sized for the price, but you could hardly taste the duck that I eventually forgot I was eating duck pizza. What was more prominent was the generous topping of fresh arugula on top that added a unique peppery twist to each bite. The inside of the pizza was great, but the crust was way too hard.<br><br>The last item to come out was the pappardelle (broad flat pasta) with braised beef tomato sauce. The pasta was tougher than what I'm used to, but apparently this is intentional. The beef and tomato sauce was excellent though. This is a sweet and savory dish that's easily enjoyable.<br><br>On a humorous note, the bathroom utterly surprised me. I saw a gentleman who obviously worked there chatting it up with a customer while music was jamming in the background through a stereo set.

The quattro stagioni was very tasty and has a nice thin crust. It was perfect when it was hot but it was a little salty when I ate some of the leftovers cold later. The beef short ribs were okay.

To say this place is 'packed' every evening, would be an understatement. The 9 - 5 local crowd begins to filter in right after work, and dining goes late into the evening. Being a regular on TA and Yelp, I had done my homework and learned that Quartino is a popular place with both Chicago visitors AND locals (always a good sign). <br><br>The atmosphere is friendly, comfortable, and very loud. (Think: gregarious dinner party with 50 of your closest friends and alcohol flowing - in a cavernous room.)  Yes, THAT kind of loud. <br><br>The wait staff is friendly, efficient, knowledgeable, and extremely accommodating. We were lucky enough to meet Lanny, Alicia, and Jose on our Sunday evening visit. They were exceptional, to say the least!  Professionalism that matched a 5-star restaurant, but with the ease of a carefully-planned family function. My husband, a former Disney employee, and I noted the outstanding service.  <br><br>This is a tapas restaurant, so the menu is pretty overwhelming with so many dishes from which to choose, if you're new to tapas. That's where your wait staff can help, offering suggestions - about pairings, how much food to expect, etc... Speaking of pairings, the red sangria was wonderful! And....  you can order just the size you want. I highly recommend a liter.... it's sublime.  The Husband chose martinis and wasn't disappointed. An excellent bottle of wine rounded out our over-the-top meal in this amazing restaurant. (We splurged a tad.)  <br><br>Attire: dressy casual for evening - not too fancy, not too casual - 'city chic' or dressier resort wear would be appropriate: dark jeans, slacks for the guys, or a nice summer dress.   <br><br>You'll find seating indoors and limited outdoors, though our HOT July visit kept us indoors. <br><br>It's a great restaurant for couples or groups... like an Italian family meal, the chairs are pulled up to accommodate all who arrive!  I don't think I'd recommend this restaurant for families with small children/babies after 5 PM... not because they wouldn't be welcomed, but because of how loud it is.  We saw a few families with small children, (looked like locals), and they were leaving shortly after we arrived around 6:15 PM. We did notice a few teenagers with parents, and even they kind of looked a little overwhelmed at the noise and pace.  During the day, probably an entirely different story. It IS, after all, a very comfortable place.   <br><br>Saved the best for last - the food:  WOW!!!  We tried a few dishes:  white bean and garlic spread with crusty bread, calamari with a house red sauce, beef tips, beef ribs, and gnocchi. All were outstanding, but the gnocchi and beef tips stood out as 'exceptional' - with rich flavors, perfectly cooked, and paired beautifully with red wine. Well into my 40's, I never truly appreciated the red wine/white wine pairing concept - and I'm a wine drinker who's visited Napa Valley a few times - until our visit to Quartino. The beef tips deserve a dry red wine.... mouth-watering!!   <br>OUTSTANDING.  <br><br>Be sure to visit the upstairs restrooms and check out the entryway as you go through their doors. Take a dollar or two for the lovely attendants in the RR.  <br><br>To close, I'd like to send a BIG thank you to Adam and his entire team.

We didn't make a reservation for a restaurant in downtown Chicago on a Saturday night, on a long weekend. So obviously, we were going to have to wait.

We got in line to put our names down for a table, while our friend tried to scope out the bar area, where they do serve dinner and seating is first come first serve. The host said there would be a 45 minute wait. We put our names down and a couple of minutes later, scratched our name off because of a call we got from our friend, who had found a table in the bar area.  <br><br>We settled in and ordered a pitcher of Sangria, which was very nice. After a lot of too and fro, we managed to decide on dinner. We ordered the Dates wrapped in Pancetta, the Braised Pork Shank, Duck Prosciutto, and the Spaghetti All' Arrabbiata ( spaghetti in spicy tomato sauce). <br><br>I think the dates wrapped in pancetta and the braised pork shank, tied for Best Dish of the Evening; however, my husband says the braised pork shank was the out-and-out winner. The Pork shank was fall-of-the-bone tender and beautifully flavored, an absolute piece of perfection. The Dates were stuffed with Gorgonzola Dolce, wrapped in a nice salty pancetta and then drizzled with honey. They tasted like little bites of heaven. The Duck Prosciutto was accompanied by some Giardiniera (pickled vegetables) which were very tasty on their own, but completely over powered the prosciutto, in my opinion. The prosciutto was also, extremely tiny pieces, and definitely my least favorite dish of them all.  The Spaghetti was the last to come out, and a pretty big portion. It was flavored very nicely, with the perfect amount of zing to it, and the Parmesan they had on the table, complimented it well. <br><br>For dessert we ordered the Zeppole, described on the menu as 'Hot Italian Doughnuts with Honey or Dark Chocolate'. When we ordered, I asked our waitress which would be better, the honey or the Dark chocolate, and she told us that she'd just bring out both. Boy! Am I glad she did. The dark chocolate was without doubt the table favorite, and got over before the last doughnut did, however, I really liked the hot doughnut with the honey as well. That said, if I had to choose, I'd go with the dark chocolate. <br><br>My only complaint about Quartino was the announcements over the speakers. The hostess was using a mic to call out the names of people waiting for a table, but the announcements were so loud, that we could not hear anything else, and had to pause in our conversations every time she would announce a name and since this is a huge restaurant, with a fast turn over, the announcements were beings made every minute or so. I think Quartino should turn down the volume just a little bit, so that the announcements aren't jarring.

Clearly this is because they didn't drain or otherwise dry the toppings adequately (my guess is it was the artichokes that flooded the crust), and water leached out all over the crust and other toppings. Absolutely inexcusable in a place that promotes its pizza as much as they do. The only way I could eat it was to smash it all together on my plate and scoop it up with my fork.<br><br>The next wave of food was a decidedly better: decent fried calamari with rather bland marinara sauce, some excellent pork dish and very good gnocchi with a cheesy spinach sauce. <br><br>After working our way through our \"second round\" and a few more beers, we moved onto the dessert. The dessert seemed to be more of an individual thing. One of our party ordered a raspberry sorbet and enjoyed it; another tried some sort of banana coppa thing and he said it was delicious; I ordered a plate of zeppole with chocolate sauce, and they were divine. Perfectly fried and the sauce had just the right amount of sweetness, bitterness and chocolate flavor. <br><br>Now, as for the noise. It was horrendously loud once the whole dinner crowd arrived. I gave up trying to hold a conversation with anyone not seated directly next to me and couldn't hear a single thing the waitress said after taking our initial drink order. Sure the place was crowded, and yes the tables are close together, but my ears were literally ringing when I stepped outside, and didn't stop ringing until I arrived home after a 10 minute Red Line subway ride. I think part of the issue is the hard floors and tin ceilings provide no sound absorption at all. I dunno - but I do know this almost ruined the evening for me. I don't know if it would be any better outside, but I can't imagine it being worse, even with the street noise, cars and subways rumbling past. <br><br>So, all in all, not a bad place. I'll may go back; will likely try to sit outside; and I may even try the pizza again, but absolutely no pizza with any topping that needs draining or drying or that contains a lot of water.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The noisiest restaurant i have ever been in.<br>decent food, relatively quick for a very busy and large place", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Still a great value.

Tagliatelle bolognese was wonderful.  We also had the mixed olives red, green and black- very tasty.  We will probably go pack for the pizza and the shrimp and garlic dish.  I highly recommend Quartino!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qo8X2OChWPQZ9IRHR4TOlA/348s.jpg", "caption": "Quartino"}]}}]}
