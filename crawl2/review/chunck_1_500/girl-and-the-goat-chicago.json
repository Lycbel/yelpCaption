Tourists and locals alike continually flock here to indulge in her innovative menu with bold flavors, intricate platings, and wonderful combinations of flavors and textures. Dishes are tapas style designed to be shared by the table. Your server will tailor the progression of the dishes you order to build on flavors throughout the meal, ultimately reaching a crescendo with the final dish.<br><br>I love the hamachi crudo. It's got a chili-soy vinaigrette, finger hots, gooseberries, puffed black rice, and garnished with some microgreens. The hamachi is fresh, tender, and has a bit of a kick from the vinaigrette. The black rice adds a crunch to the dish.<br><br>The seared scallops are cooked perfectly. Each order only has 3 scallops, so plan accordingly based on your party size. There's also wild maitake and wood ear mushrooms, oyster sauce brodo, and a squash brandade. <br><br>The wood oven roasted pig face is perhaps the signature dish on the menu. There's a sunny side egg placed on top, with crispy potato sticks on the bottom. The pig face is crispy, fatty, and tender. It blends well with the potato sticks and egg.<br><br>The confit goat belly is absolutely unreal. It's got bourbon butter slathered over the entire dish, which is fantastic. There's also lump crab and lobster chunks. The goat is melt in your mouth tender, and the seafood is perfection.<br><br>The crisp braised pork shank is usually the finishing salvo of your menu, if you order it, and it's a must order. The pork is crispy on the outside and fall off the bone tender inside. It requires very minimal effort to extract meat off the bone, and the meat is so juicy, flavorful and tender.<br><br>Everything on the menu is executed flawlessly and there isn't such a thing as a bad dish. The above are just some personal favorites I get each time I visit. Even the roasted cauliflower is a must order. Other dishes that I recommend are the goat carpaccio, goat empanadas, and wood fired octopus. For dessert, get the semifreddo and toffee yummy cake. Both are so good you won't be able to pick which one's your favorite.<br><br>The service is wonderful and very helpful. Be advised that the reservations have a set time limit before they have to turn around the table, which is totally understandable given how in demand a seat here is.

We were lucky to get a reservation only a week in advance on Sunday at 5:30 PM. The place was already crowded when we got there. We sat in the corner where there's the huge picture of a girl and a goat in gothic style. It looks like a very cool place. We quickly ordered a few items from the menu which we have already chosen from looking at pictures and reviews on Yelp. We went for the goat liver mousse, scallops, goat ribs, wood fire octopus and duck tartare. <br><br>Everything was delicious! It's very unique and has interesting combinations incorporating Asian fusion and influence. These are dishes that you wouldn't typically see at other restaurants so I was very excited to try, and of course they didn't disappoint. The goat liver mousse was so smooth and the bread was warm and yummy. We had to ask for more bread since we finished it so quickly. They saw that we had 3 people so they asked if we want 3 scallops instead of 2. They just charged for the extra scallops. They were cooked perfectly. The goat ribs were very soft and felt off the bones. The octopus was pretty good but that didn't seem too creative compared to the other ones. I also had duck tartare for the first time and the duck didn't taste too strong or anything. <br><br>We were very happy with the food itself overall but quite disappointed at the service. The server seems inattentive and sometimes when we asked for something, he doesn't seem too enthusiastic to get it for us. I understand maybe because the place was crowded but still it makes our experience a bit less satisfying, hence the 4 stars. <br><br>We ended order one more dish, the roasted pig face since there was so much hype about it. When it was brought out, we were told to mix everything up, the uglier the better. So we did just that! It was creamy and very rich and heavy. I think it tasted good but a bit too much and not too balanced. They probably need more veggies stuff in there.

Interesting choice of presentation and Im sure during the day it'll look much better. I did though absolutely adore that cute little Goat motif in the center of the dining room wall.<br><br>Service : Considering it was a Friday night dinner, suffice to say the place was packed to the brim! We did have reservations though so got a neat little corner within 20 mins (I shudder at the thought of coming here as Walk Ins!!). Once seated though, the service was prompt and pleasant. <br><br>Food : We got ourselves a portion each of Goat Empanadas, Confit Goat Belly, Wood Fired Lamb Ribs and Wood Fired Oysters.<br><br>The Goat Empanadas were fried to perfection, the shell not too thick and the meat succulent although lacking a punch in flavor. <br><br>The Goat Belly was an interesting setup as I've never paired goat with seafood, let alone Lobster and Crab for that matter! The belly itself was cooked just right and as all Belly dishes go (Pork or Goat), it needs something to counter or balance that fattiness. Sadly with milder protein like crab and lobster, it just got lost and up being a one tangent dish. The bourbon butter though was exquisite!<br><br>The oysters were smoked to perfection. For a second, they almost looked raw :). The spice was well done and overall it was a decent dish<br><br>The lamb ribs were one of our favorite dishes of the night! Fall of the bone and the thick sauce coating is how you typically expect a well made ribs to be. <br><br>We ended our evening with a portion of their Aw Honey Honey dessert.

The short ribs were similar to when you get kalbi at a Korean restaurant, but the pairing of the apple salad was a good contrast. As for the lamb ribs, they were incredibly tender. It fell off the bone so easily that you had to lift the piece of meat onto your plate. The glaze on this was smooth and truly wrapped flavor all over the meat with no dry parts.

The style seemed to be a modern twist on comfort food, which is something we enjoy. We ordered a couple of vegetable dishes including the sauteed green beans ($13) and the roasted cauliflower ($13). For something so simple like greenbeans and cauliflower, our tastebuds were blown away from the get-go. The green beans had a great fish sauce vinaigrette and the cashews gave it an Asian-inspired flavor. The cauliflower with pickled peppers, pine nuts and mints all blended well together.

We loved the flavor of the goat in the empanadas as it wasn't too gamey or heavy. The miso bleu aioli, grilled pickled beech mushrooms, and queso fresco, brightened up the dish. The confit goat belly was probably my least favorite dish because it was so heavy with the bourbon butter, which coated all of the goat belly, lobster, crab, and fennel.<br><br>A couple pork dishes stood out with the wood oven roasted pig face ($19) as well as the must-order crisp braised pork shank ($26).

All I knew was, if I were to go to Chicago, I must go to The Girl & The Goat. That's what everyone said. And they were right. I didn't regret it one bit.<br><br>But note: if you want to eat goat leg or goat shoulder, you must call and pre-order one day in advance. The goat shoulder is $25/lb with a 7lb minimum purchase. The goat leg was even larger.... We didn't pre-order because 7lb for 5 people was way too much food!<br><br>However, there are other goat dishes that you can still order!!!<br><br>rory mcilroy. broker's​ gin . lychee . pink peppercorn . black tea . lemon. This cocktail was one of the most refreshing, light and caffeinated cocktails I have ever had. I love the contrast of the tea and lychee and lemon yet the butter and sweet and sour flavors blended together so nicely.<br><br>goat liver mousse. berry lamb jam . cranberry mostarda . bread & butter pickles. I really love this dish even though I feel like I might already be biased because I love pate and this is similar to pate in concept. The mousse was very light and soft yet rich in goat liver flavor. I enjoyed spreading the mousse on the bread. The contrast with the pickled sauces was a palate cleanser.<br><br>hamachi crudo. chili-soy vinaigrette . finger hots . gooseberries . puffed black rice. This was everyone's favorite dish all around. I actually have never had good hamachi crudo before. The fish would always be so tough to chew. But these were as tender and soft and smooth as can be<br><br>wood oven roasted pig face. sunny side egg . tamarind . cilantro . red wine-maple . potato stix. Hmm, I think this was my favorite!!! I just enjoyed eating the meat so much!! There was such good flavor in this dish. I think it's also the tamarind.<br><br>crisp braised pork shank. buttermilk dressing . butternut squash kimchi . naan. Wait!! I think this was my favorite too!!!! The pork shank was HUGE. The meat flakes off from the bones so easy. Ugh. So. Delicious.<br><br>bucatini. milk braised pork shoulder . tomato. Hmm, I think this was also my favorite!!!! The pasta was very soft and chewy. The light tomato sauce was milky and creamy from the milk braised. The pork was soooo tender!<br><br>caramel corn & malt balls. vanilla malt ice cream . popcorn caramel . chocolate magic shell.

The food isn't going to blow your mind, the wait can be super long, and the value isn't quite there - but it is a fun place to visit. Especially if you're into Stephanie's work!<br><br>So the main dish that stands out is the wood roasted pig face. Now, don't let the name put you off - it's more of the tender meat of the cheek and the dish doesn't resemble a pig. For butchers and chefs, the cheek is actually a fought-over delicacy because it is very tender and flavorful (and also scarce in quantity). Get this dish every time - it will not disappoint you. <br><br>(Honestly, if you can't come back to Girl & and the Goat often, I'd consider getting one order per two people that want to eat this.)<br><br>The other stand-out dish was the pork roast - which is much bigger than the pig face but also not nearly as flavorful. It's still very good and crispy and can help fill the carnivores of the party, so I'd recommend getting this if you have at least one big eater in your party.<br><br>The rest of the dishes are all solid choices - though nothing mind-blowing at all. Because of the limited amazing dishes here, Girl and the Goat isn't our first must-go places in our foodie world but since you're probably already here, here's a quick rundown.<br><br>- Wood Roasted Pig Face: just in case you skimmed the review and missed it above. GET THIS<br>- Bread and Butters: there's usually 3 per season, with the mushroom butter usually being there. 4/5, cool imagination put into this, helps fill you, no need to get more than one.<br>- Happy Juice: it's nostalgic to me to get this. Off-menu, and they've changed the formula since. I think it's now some kind of ginger beer and other juice. Kinda small, but a tasty drink!<br>- Cauliflower: I keep ordering this despite all my previous reviews saying it's not worth it. We got it again because our waitress really enjoyed it, but we agreed it's not worth it.<br>- Goat Loin: The meat itself was very tough for some reason. But the olives and \"Mediterrean\" flavors around it were awesome. So 4/5 for the flavors, 3/5 for the meat.<br>- Scallops: perfectly cooked. Solid 4/5<br><br>Overall, I'm not sure if Girl and the Goat feels the need to innovate since they have so much demand through popularity. It's been 6 years since my last visit, and it felt even more commercialized than before. But if the formula works, then why fix what's not broken. I would probably only come here if someone really liked Stephanie's work or the lines elsewhere are too long, and it happened to be short at G&tG.

I liked that they had many fresh seafood choices on the menu. I will post photos of some of our dishes. There were about a dozen chefs in the back making each dish that came out not only tasting fabulous but were works of art. <br>Our waiter was very attentive to our needs and an empty plate or water glass never stayed that way longer then 5 min if at all. <br>Tip: plan ahead and make a reservation weeks in advance. We were able to walk right in.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Just like the other Goat restaurants, this place is great for vegans and vegetarians because they crafted a menu just for you! and that menu includes items from the regular menu if your dinner companion(s) want to try something from there and share with you.

I was slated for a 10:30pm reservation on a Wednesday (odd time but I was flying in from the West Coast, so the time difference worked in my favor, plus you take what you can get at a place that is somehow still one of the hottest tickets in town years later). Slow baggage and some O'Hare Uber shenanigans meant any chance of checking into the hotel to change was a lost cause which left me rushing in a cab straight from the airport to the restaurant bags in tow. The host was incredibly understanding and kindly stowed our many bags away for the length of dinner and gave no mind to the fact that I looked like I had been traveling for the past 9 hours. <br><br>We were seated in high seats right by the kitchen, which I think is great for smaller parties as I love getting to interact with chefs and witness the frenetic energy that a busy kitchen emits. <br><br>Now on to the good stuff...<br><br>As far as drinks, I started with the \"Ring of Fire\" as slightly spicy tequila based drink balanced out with some pomegranate sweetness, followed with a nice hoppy IPA with good citra hops, juicy and hazy, and finished with the \"All Nighter\" the perfect rye based boozy after dinner cocktail to cut through some of the dessert sweetness. <br><br>The food at the Girl and the Goat is meant to be shared and my only regret is that there weren't at least two more of us to help take down some other items of the menu. <br><br>Here's a rundown of the food ordered:<br>Roasted Cauliflower with pickled peppers, pine nuts, and mint. <br>Spiced Shrimp with delicata squash, brown-butter miso aioli, and furikake<br>Seared Scallops with wild maitake and wood ears, oyster sauce brodo, and squash brandade<br>Wood-Fired Lamb Ribs with cranberry-tamarind glaze<br>Goat Empanadas with miso bleu aioli, grilled pickled beech mushrooms, and queso fresco<br>Confit Goat Belly with bourbon butter, lobster and crab, and fennel<br><br>Nearly every dish outmatched the one before it, with my personal favorites being the spiced shrimp (the pairing with the crispy squash really made this a complete dish) and the confit goat belly which was so decadent I can barely even begin to describe it. <br><br>For dessert we went for the caramel corn and malt balls which had vanilla malt ice cream, caramel popcorn and a chocolate magic shell. The piece de resistance was when one of the kindly chefs we had been interacting with throughout dinner tossed another dessert our way because \"you look like you've had a day,\" and that's how I discovered the joy of a sweet potato toffee cake and sour cream ice cream, two things I never would've imagined ordering on my own. <br><br>All in all, a fantastic experience and great to see that a restaurant with this much hype can exceed those expectations.

I could eat this bread everyday. What an interesting way to use yuzu. <br><br>Next, we tried the goat empanadas. Again, the sauces on the empanadas were so flavorful. I loved the crunch of the onions over the warm, crisp empanadas. The goat meat was soft and tender. <br><br>We tried the bucatini and pork shank from the meats section of the menu. The bucatini noodles tasted freshly made and had a creamy sauce on it. We really liked this dish. The pork shank is MASSIVE. The meat falls right off the bone. It's so tender and the two sauces that come with it are perfection. I love the pickled radishes and naan that come with it as well. <br><br>We didn't save room for desserts.

Wait times exceed 2-3 hours, as this restaurant is situated on Randolph Street in the insanely popular \"West Loop\" neighborhood in Chicago, which is quickly becoming one of the culinary capitals of the country. They're neighbors with the notorious \"Au Cheval\" amongst others. From what I understand, the bar is first come, first serve, and you can order from the full menu here if you're willing to hawk seats.<br><br>Stephanie Izard has been getting a lot of press recently, and in my opinion, she deserves even more.

Dress is very casual as well, which is an added bonus.<br><br>After about a 15-minute wait, we were seated and ordered a bottle of white wine, which was reasonably priced. They also comped us some focaccia for not having our table ready when we were seated.

Seriously do not skip the cauliflower... even if you don't like vegetables. I could eat this all day. The salmon and beef tongue were pretty average in my opinion, though my friends RAVED about the salmon. The only dish I didn't care much for was the ribs, but these came second-to-last, and I was pretty full at this point. They are a bit fatty, so it really depends how you like your meat. My friend said this was his favorite dish. This was MORE than enough food for the 4 of us, and we all had arrived extremely hungry.<br><br>I know that the goat empanadas, scallops, squash blossom rangoon and crab cakes are also really popular. Gives good reason to return.<br><br>As if this place wasn't already spectacular, the service was stellar (we left well over 20%+ for tip), as they were really diligent all night. Our waiter also \"sequenced\" our food out, as we ordered all at once, which demonstrated the expertise / knowledgeability of the waitstaff here. There was 4 of us dining, and all said, even with the wine and dessert, this meal came out to under $70 / person, which is incredible for a meal of this caliber.<br><br>A+, would give 6 stars if I could, and you're almost certain to love, regardless of your demographic.

I was a little hesitant but glad I tried.Juicy with a great salad on top to complement.<br><br>Skuna bay salmon. Served chilled, extremely tender. The mix of strawberry, avocado, and asparagus actually made this my wife's favorite dish.<br><br>Sauteed green beans had a great fish sauce vinaigrette that was a perfect complement to the heavier meat dishes. Our waitress gave this to us on the house as a recommendation of her own! Excellent recommendation.<br><br>Pig face. Another item that I was a little skeptical about but loved the porky taste and was essentially like a great sausage/egg dish you might have for breakfast, just a lot fancier!<br><br>Pork Shank was a ton of meat and very tender. I literally could slide the bone out as the meat was prepared so well. The naan and dipping sauce were excellent as well. We barely were able to finish this dish due to the amount!<br><br>Complimentary cake for my birthday at the end was very sweet of our waitress as well. The service, explanation of the menu was excellent. We loved our location on the bar stools in front of the kitchen. We saw our food being made and the kitchen hummed in harmony.

We started with the goat empanadas; I don't usually eat goat but these were great. After that, the green garlic pierogies, and the chickpea fritters. The fritters were probably my least favorite but their side was great: quinoa and pomegranate seeds, which I never would have thought to put together. We also had beef short ribs, which were the most tender short ribs I've ever had, and we ended with the chicken dish, which was actually large and could be eaten as a meal.<br><br>My friend also got the fried oysters and a half order of the scallops (literally ONE scallop, haha) and enjoyed both.<br><br>The 4.5 stars vs 5 comes from the fact that although our water glasses were always refilled, our waiter didn't check on us that much.

So you can only imagine how excited I was to come here... Unfortunately, I think this restaurant falls in the latter, largely due to Chef Izard's Top Chef acclaim. I found the dishes to be very heavy and the flavor contrast was too strong and callous .. It lacked the cohesion I typically seek in an award winning restaurant.<br><br>We came in on a Monday evening and waited a little over an hour for a table. I genuinely felt they would've seated us earlier if we stuck around (we went to a nearby bar to kill time), as we were seated minutes upon returning, despite the hostess informing us that there may be an additional 30 min wait. Anyhow.. we ordered the beet salad, escargot ravioli, beef tongue, pork face, and goat confit. <br><br>--The beet salad was delivered with arugula and ?radicchio, bathed in a vinaigrette. For me, I was unsure if the beets were fresh or canned.. it was slivered finely, and when you ate it with the green bitters, the contrast was so potent that it made it difficult to enjoy the subtle sweetness of the beets. For reference, my fav beet salad ever is Jean Georges' Public Kitchen and/or from ABC Kitchen .. This just missed the mark IMO.<br><br>-- Escargot ravioli was delicious by itself but it sat on a salty beef broth that was far too strong and overwhelmed the ravioli. I would recommend this dish if you knew how to construct your bite: would suggest plating the crunchy onion on top of the ravioli, and allow it to sit on the SMALLEST amount of broth in your spoon .. only then did it become more palatable for me.<br><br>-- Beef tongue: very much like a warm salad but no grain. Probably one of the more solid dish but the vinaigrette was too heavy to allow the savoriness of the tongue to stand out. There is a lot of texture in this dish but it was hard to construct a bite as the crisp (I think it might've been fried wonton/dumpling skin?) was oversized, so the different ingredient ratio was problematic.<br><br>-- Pork face is legit a rip of a Filipino sig sig. I wish they would give credit where it is due .. Deep notes of tamarind and vinegar, with great crispiness of the pig cheek/ears. Prob another one of my fav dishes largely because it reminds me of classic Filipino food in Queens, but very disappointed that it failed to credit a culture that mastered this dish for ages. And for $16-18 (don't remember exact cost), it was def overpriced compared to the aunties in Woodside that make it for $8-10 (and, trust me, they make it way better).<br><br>-- Goat confit was perhaps the most confusing thing I consumed all night. The goat didn't taste like confit cooking .. more like abbreviated braising. Meat was musky and muscular. It was accompanied by lobster which was deliciously sweet and drizzled with a cream reduction. The lobster by itself was great, but to add it as a complimentary note to the goat was very confusing and, personally, didn't mingle well. This dish was just unharmonious IMO. <br><br>Overall: it just wasn't my cup of tea. The different flavors within one dish contrasted too sharply for me to enjoy. It felt like the dishes were generated whimsically without much thought to its cohesion .. or maybe that's the intention? Moreover, I actually found the dishes to be heavy (ie overwhelmed with vinaigrette or the roux? coated the respective meat too much) that I felt absurdly gluttonous after eating here. And, for the record, portions are huge by NYC standard. If I had to do it again, I prob would've ordered no more than 4 dishes. <br><br>Would I recommend? I guess if you're into sharp contrasting flavors and rich cuisines, but, maybe for the more scrupulous tongue, it might be best to skip.

With green beans, white anchovy, bread crumbs, and an avocado creme fraiche I thought this was a unique spin on beets compared to the classic beets/greens/feta dish that you get at most restaurants lately. <br><br>The seared diver scallops with toasted miso brown butter aioli, blood orange, smoked beet and pistacho were easily the best scallops I have ever had. <br><br>The waitress recommended the sauteed green beans.

The sauce was a little too heavy for my taste but the crisp texture of the beans was a nice touch.<br>-Bucatini - nothing too impressive about this pasta dish. The pork shoulder in this dish was a little too salty. <br>-Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face - one of the restaurant's signature dishes.

There was a multi-cultural approach to the composition in my opinion. The breading was delicately soft, yet still sturdy enough the hold the filling. The inside was actually quite liquidy, which isn't a bad thing but took me off guard. The crab flavor is fresh and is not buried by the other ingredients.  <br><br>Their Sourdough bread is actually worth ordering. Plenty of blueberry sweetness, along with that tang that sourdough has. The sauces and schmear gave it a further dimension that  offers depth and comfort.   <br><br>The Goat Empanadas are solid, but I thought they would be amazing. The braised goat on the inside reminded me of peppered steak, with that distinct goat taste. The breading was a little starchier than I would like, as the flavor itself wasn't memorable. But they are still worth getting if you have a big appetite. I like that you can order them in any sized quantity.  <br><br>Grilled Broccoli - Not as good as I hoped, but it primarily relies on the smoked bleu cheese sauce from underneath. Not as refined in composition as I would like, but there's something base satisfying from the sauce itself. The broccoli was OK, but since the sauce was the main attraction, they didn't do much to the broccoli. <br><br>Goat Belly Confit - This was not meant for any mere mortal, but for the gods! The fatty, gamy goat belly blended harmoniously with the lobster, while the bourbon butter intertwined an unholy marriage of flavor that destroys the stratosphere. If you ordered bread, sop up some of the bourbon butter once you're done with the meat. Honestly, this dish is worth Michelin star status. I absolutely recommend everyone order this, even if you are stuffed to the gills.  <br><br>Lamb Ribs - With the wet rub they use, these bad boys are basically meat candy! Fall off the bone, plenty of candied char, with the lovely gamy taste to reign it all in. This is definitely still tapas size, but don't be afraid to order these.  <br><br>Pork belly - Asian inspiration is strong with this one! The sour cherries and bok choy are a great combo to the slices of pork. Although I had envisioned a block of pork belly, they shave it down to thin slices and sear it to resemble pork chop pieces. This was the favorite dish at the table, so even the pickiest of people can appreciate this one.  <br><br>Green Beans - Our server actually brought us out a decent size sample of the green beans, as he recommended we try them. I generally dont like green beans, but I figured I would give them a shot. They definitely tasted like fresh, boiled green beans, with a bunch of sauce drizzled on top. This was probably my least favorite part of the meal. There wasn't anything special about it IMO. I dont see how this could be the dish that created the restaurant. Im glad my server let me try it for free, but its not something I ever care to have again. <br><br>Chicken - Our waiter wrote this down by accident, so they gave it to us for free once they understood their error. I usually don't order chicken from places because its usually the most conservative dish on the menu. Surprisingly, they did a great job giving this tired old bird some new life. The chicken itself was moist, and they focused on just dark meat (makes sense from the gamy-centric focus). The  plating was a work of art with all the colors and shaved vegetables they used. The honey ramp glaze was the real show stopper of this meal. The sweet yet earthy taste brought me back for more with each bite.  <br><br>Popcorn Dessert - What a lovely dessert! Salty from the popcorn, creamy from the chocolate malt ball ice cream, and lightly sweet all around. It truly felt like having movie theater popcorn (light at the butter) with milk duds. They gave a good portion where two dainty people can share, or one hungry person.  <br><br>Overall I was quite pleased.

We got:<br>- pork face - creamy and crispy<br>- cauliflower - loved it, cooked so well!<br>- goat belly - very interesting flavours, generous amount of lobster and crab on top as well<br>- green bean - very flavourful! Chef in front of us just cooked it and handed to us :) love the experience!<br>- pork shank- omg at this point we are both full already and this is giant. Flavour is good but unfortunately we can't finish it. <br><br>Great night overall and will definitely recommend this to anyone who is coming to Chicago for a visit.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/c70i9nVLwYvzq4vh11lc7g/168s.jpg", "caption": "Chefs"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "I've always wanted to try this place out and was able to make last minute Reservations.  This place did not disappoint.  The food was delicious and everything came out one at at time piping hot and ready to eat.  It's all tapas style and definitely nice to share with 2, even 3 ppl at the table.  We had the ponzu oysters, very sweet and tasty.  The shishito peppers are yummy but nothing too fancy about.  The duck tartar is amazing must try !! The rye bread is delicious, the apple spread is really addicting.  The scallop is sooo good ... they are a good size.  In all I really enjoyed my meal here!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Girl and the Goat was amazing. We had a reservation and came early. They seated us on time. The server was friendly and recommended that two people usually get 4-6 dishes to share. We got 11 dishes (lol!). The kitchen decides what order they come out in from lightest to heaviest. <br><br>We ordered: <br>Sweet Onion Brioche bread - 10/10 This was by far my favorite. I felt stupid ordering bread at such a nice restaurant but omg, I would have felt stupid if I HADNT ordered this. I loved it so much i actually ordered another one in the middle of my meal. The bread is soft with a slightly sweet onion smell to it and it came with a pepper relish and the yummiest cream cheese (with a hint of smoked salmon) I've ever had. It was such a perfect combination of warm bread with creamy and cool cream cheese. THIS DISH IS TO-DIE-FOR. <br><br>Raw Oysters - 9/10 Fresh and tangy, loved it! Only downside is that it came with 4 :( <br><br>Green garlic pierogies - 8/10 Soft and creamy on the outside and crunchy and delicious on the outside. The corn and mushroom relish underneath was amaaaazing. <br><br>Escargot ravioli - 6/10 This is the first time I've had snail and it wasn't bad! The broth was a little salty though. <br><br>Goat empanadas - 9/10 I loved the mushroom and aioli that came with the empanadas. The meat was tender and juicy and very flavorful. <br><br>Goat belly confit - 4/10 I found that the crab meat didn't really belong but this dish is usually a huge hit with everyone. <br><br>Sauteed green beans - 7/10 Really enjoyed these green beans. They were blanched well so they still had a bit of crunch to them. The vinagrette on them is delicious and the peanuts were a nice surprise. However, there was SO MANY green beans that this was where I started to fill up. Beware, this is a huge dish (in comparison to the others). I sort of wish this came out more in the middle of the meal and not towards the end. <br><br>Crispy pork shank - 10/10 A huge crispy pork shank came out with a ranch and buffalo dressing and a piece of naan bread on the side. Wow!!  The pork was so crispy on the outside and so juicy on the inside that I was able to just pull the bone clean off of the meat. I actually found that the meat itself was so flavorful that I did need or use any of the sauces it came with. All I needed was the naan bread. This is also a huge dish by itself too.<br><br>Caramel corn and malt balls - 10/10 What a fun dessert!! The scoops of vanilla had a crunchy chocolate coating and the light and airy but sweet popcorn was an interesting play on textures to contrast the cool and creamy vanilla. Sounds simple but it was a delight to eat. <br><br>Note: we really wanted to try the calamari bruschetta but it wasn't available that day. Apparently, not every dish on the menu is available every day. Every morning, each dish on the menu is made by the chefs to assess the quailty of the ingredients. If they are not up to par, that dish is not served that day. <br><br>Chef Stephanie Izard is a culinary genius. All of the food was unique, playful and interesting and I am excited to try her other restaurants. The only downside of that evening is that I didn't get to see/meet the chef herself.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aJx1UAnzd9TXqBGiTV9VYQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "Sweet Onion Brioche"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bh-621Sm_UQsHnljPJ1pMQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Crisp Braised Pork Shank"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uQJjbfK-4RC81VwjaDIjEw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Goat Empanadas"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "I think this review will probably be repetitive about how amazing the experience was. I noted in the reservation that It was for a birthday dinner, and they gave us the best seats in the house at the chef's table. We were able to oversee all the dishes being made, which made our decision about what to order that much easier and fun! We started out with the goat empanadas, cause we felt It was our duty to order a goat dish at a goat restaurant, and they were highly recommended. They were absolutely delicious--fried to perfection and topped with some cheese, mushrooms, sprouts, and onions atop an orange sauce. The meet inside was super flavorful and It was a perfect portion for two. We also ordered the octopus, which was so good. It came over a pepita mole sauce and pickled banana squash. It was bursting with flavor, not fishy at all, and a great texture. We also ordered the wood grilled broccoli, which were charred to a wonderful crisp. The blue cheese sauce that accompanied It added a nice flavor as well as an addition of what seemed to be Rice Krispies for some texture. We got a complimentary kohlrabi salad that was super yummy. It was filled with so many different greens, adding so much flavor, such as fennel, beemster, roasted shitake, pear, etc. It was also dressed very nicely! Next, we had the wood fired lamb ribs, our favorite dish by far. They were so extremely tender and filled with so much flavor. They were absolutely delicious. Lastly, they gave us a complimentary birthday dessert of caramel corn and malt balls. The Caramel corn was crunchy and reminded me of an upscale Cracker Jack. The ice cream was so yummy and the chocolate shell was delicious. It was a perfect way to finish off all the goat restaurants!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Absolutely wonderful.

I moved the table about two inches away from another table, and a server assistant came by and pushed it back and told me not to do that.  So you can imagine when they then proceeded to sit a woman next to me that smelled like she bathed in perfume, I was not pleased. I hate the smell of perfume, especially when I'm eating.  So since I knew I wasn't allowed to move over, we had to move.  We got moved to the area closer to the bar, and we were happy because the table was shorter, so we were sitting closer to each other.  We were in the hosts' butts, but we didn't mind.<br><br>Service was hit or miss, we waited a long time for repeat drink orders, and had to flag someone down.  Food was good but nothing that stood out as being the best anything I've ever had - the pig face was quite good, and so was the goat liver mousse.  I come from a huge city as well, though, so this kind of food is not inaccessible to me.  <br><br>Overall, we had a good meal, but I wouldn't go back next time I'm in Chicago.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Nothing beats the flavors, service and food here.

But because I asked some colleagues again for recommendations and Girl & the Goat was mentioned I decided to give it a try....score! Dinner for 2 @ 7. <br><br>We got to the restaurant just in time for our reservation and checked in. The host informed us that it would be a little while because several tables had paid, but they were taking their time. No problem. We decided to sit in the bar area and have a couple of drinks. I ordered The Best of Three--it was awesome! Ketel One Vodka, pimms #1, cucumber and lime. So refreshing and not too sweet. My dinner companion had a White Russian. <br><br>We sat enjoying our cocktails for a few minutes, taking in the decor and buzz of the place--it was packed!

We closed out our tab and made our way to the dining area.  <br><br>If you want an intimate place, this isn't for you. If you don't mind basically sitting with the neighboring table, then you're all set. We luckily were sat by 3 folks on our left who were nice and chatted with us a bit. On the other side was a couple who were either arguing or just didn't feel like talking to each other. You know the couple that sits at dinner not talking to each other...that was them. <br><br>The waiter stopped by to greet us and apologized for the wait. 'No need to apologize,' we said. 'It wasn't long.'  He explained that everything is served family style and he recommended sharing 6 things since it was two of us. <br><br>The menu is pretty diverse and totally interesting. They had a nice selection of vegetables, seafood, chicken, pork, beef and of course, goat. We studied the menu while he was gone and were ready to order when he showed up with complementary bread with smoke salmon mousse and pickled peppers because we had to wait beyond our reservation time. Wow! That was impressive that they take service that seriously. We ordered the rest of our meal and he would determine how to bring our and order the courses. <br><br>We were ready for refills on our cocktails so I got a martini and my dinner partner ordered Best of Three. We tucked into the bread and dip, and it was super. I haven't been eating a lot of bread because I've been watching carbs but it was so worth it. <br><br>Our first course showed up, which was the hamachi crudo. The crudo has a puffed black rice, which gave it a cool crunch. It also had pickled kumquats and a soy-chili vinaigrette, which added the right amount of kick. It was great. <br><br>Next up was roasted cauliflower and roasted shishito peppers that had Parmesan and miso...so yummy! The cauliflower was interesting too with mint and pickled peppers. I was already super full but we had two more things coming, so I had to muscle through. <br><br>Then came the goat empanadas. I have never had goat but felt compelled to try it since this place is known for it. The empanadas seemed like a good entry-level option. They were so good! The meat filling reminded me of pulled pork. <br><br>The final thing delivered was the crispy beef short rib. I was so full I could only try one bite.

The OLIVE FOCACCIA ($7) was indeed hearty and was on the artisan bread level with the asiago crusted exterior and pull-apart soft interior. The harissa butter was interesting but to me tasted too much like regular whipped butter, so I opted for the olive oil dip instead.<br><br>(+++) Though simple sounding, the SAUTEED GREEN BEANS ($12) lives up to its reputation. The beans themselves are fresh and sauteed to the perfect al dente texture, given a twist with the fish sauce vinaigrette, a crunch with the cashews, and a creaminess with the aioli. It's the homemade staple perfected to Chicago bucket list status.<br><br>(+++) The CONFIT GOAT BELLY ($16) was the most refined dish of the night, a delicate balance of melt-in-your-mouth goat belly (yes, it is similar to pork belly but more gamey), lobster and crab, and fennel, then glazed with bourbon butter. There is a lot going on and it takes awhile for it to all sink in. I suggest eating this dish in small bites in the true spirit of fine dining so that you can pick up on the complexities.<br><br>(+++) The CRISP BRAISED PORK SHANK ($26)... is huuuuggggee! I think the most amazing part is its texture, which was something of a gradient from a crispy roasty exterior to a buttery fall-off-the-bone interior. Although there was so much meat, it never got boring because of the heterogeneity of the meat and the DIY flavor options with the buttermilk dressing and curry sauce. The squash-shiitake kimchi kept things interesting as well with its provocative fermented tones, and the naan had a very thin texture with a puffy, doughy composition that reminded me of Taiwanese green onion pancakes. The touches of fusion seem a bit sporadic, but the creativity made it a memorable dining experience.<br><br>We were so stuffed (thanks to the bread and the giant pork shank) that unfortunately left had no room for dessert. Being the crazy Yelpy foodie that I am, I made sure we returned before leaving Chicago in order to try Girl &  the Goat's famous goat cheese dessert.<br><br>(+) The YAY FOR GJETOST ($11) featured the gjetost (goat cheese ice cream), which had a delicious full-bodied flavor. You could taste the cheese, though it wasn't pungent per se and it was heavily incorporated into a lusciously creamy ice cream. In my opinion, the focus shifted somewhat too much to the accompanying apple cake, and it was too sweet for my tastes with the candied almonds and ample caramel sauce.<br><br>(++) I preferred the STICKY TASTY CRUNCHY YUMMY TOFFEE CAKE ($11) (it's not as much of a hodgepodge as it sounds). The sweet potato based cake was unique and earthy, pairing well with tart gooseberries. Again, I think it was made too sweet with the toffee sauce, toffee crunch, and brown butterscotch ice cream (though deliciously indulgent). <br><br>Overall, we really enjoyed our visits to Girl & the Goat. The price is very reasonable, considering the quantity of quality food. The style is casual-trendy with stellar high-caliber cooking and a backdrop of a chic rustic ambiance--perfect for trying Stephanie Izard's genius cooking without the stuffiness of fine dining.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rCNf_5kSWtOzntZNTuAsqg/348s.jpg", "caption": "Local 75 and Morning Ritual"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SySDBZYzSraBIzcDmon9tA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Olive focaccia ($7)"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Z0N2f2AJNnOhfIgICEeDag/168s.jpg", "caption": "Close-up of the delicious pork shank"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "A MUST in Chicago!!

I booked like a month before my visit and I ended up with a 4:45pm dinner on a Monday night, which seems crazy early for dinner but it was better than not having a reservation at all. <br><br>We ordered the following:<br>-Potato bread: A moderate sized bread round served with a red pepper sauce and a yogurt chive one. The yogurt chive one was my fave but if you mixed the two, you also get an amazing new sauce that the bread works really well with. The bread itself is pretty much a french with herbs and bits of potatoes in it. It was nice, soft and fluffy in the inside and crispy on the outside. We couldn't stop ourselves and ended up eating the whole loaf before our other dishes came. <br>5/5<br><br>-Branzino: Whole branzino fish bathed in a red fresno chile sauce, topped with a green papaya salad. The green papaya topping reminded me of the typical ginger slivers you find on a whole fish dish at your typical Chinese restaurant. The skin on the fish was nice and crispy. The sauce had a kick to it but it was not insanely spicy, worked really well with the fish. Loved that the fish was deboned but we did find some occasional bones towards the front of the head and the tail (our server had already warned us and we are no strangers to eating non-deboned whole fish)<br>5/5<br><br>-Crispy Pork Shank: This dish was amazing, the pork was so crispy on the outside, yet so tender on the inside. I was blown away when our server dropped off the dish and stabbed a fork into the middle of the shank, the fork literally melted into the meat as if it was butter on a warm loaf of bread... We snapped a couple of pictures and went straight to digging into it. The shank was served bone in. I lightly picked up the bone and the meat around the bone just fell off effortlessly. The dish is paired off with a kimchi sauce, a white light garlic sauce, a naan looking bread that tastes like a peking duck bun and some slivers of kimchied radish? This dish basically reminded me of a play on peking duck but with Korean fusion and with pork instead of duck. <br>5/5<br><br>-Bucatini: I wanted pasta so I got me some. The pasta itself was a little salty for my liking but all the flavors were there. The bucatini was cooked al dente and topped with tender pork shoulder and heirloom tomatoes. Super yummy, my husband killed most of it because he liked it so much. <br>5/5<br><br>-Toffee cake: Dessert cake made with sweet potatoes, topped with toffee, served with a butterscotch ice cream and some tart fruits. This dish was our least favorite. The savory dishes here definitely overshadows the sweet dishes here. We could've gone with it but we came so far and we had to at least try their desserts. <br>3/5<br><br>We had 5 dishes and our bill came out to be under $100!

I will say I am typically never a fan of expensive small plates but Girl and the Goat was an exception. We were a group of 7 (definitely get reservations ahead of time) and ordered 17 dishes (waitress recommended 2-3 dishes per person but we like to eat). I'm not a big goat/lamb/meat in general fan so I'll give my take on my favorites but pretty much everything we ate was raves about. <br><br>From the breads section, get the sweet onion brioche. That relish is bomb and the salmon cream cheese was a subtle touch. I hate olives so the olive bread was not for me but if you like a strong olive flavor, check it out. <br><br>From the vegetarian section, I recommend the green beans, cauliflower, and pierogis. I absolutely hate it when restaurants make vegetables bland but this was not the case here. Everything was packed with flavor and had multiple components that somehow all worked beautifully together. Roasted cauliflower was the best from this section. Beet salad could be skipped. <br><br>I love seafood so I liked everything we tried from the fish section - calamari (be warned it's not fried), crab Rangoon, and halibut. The halibut has a nice sear to it and worked well with the mushrooms. The creamy squash in the rangoon was a creative and delicious twist. The bruschetta underneath the calamari was bomb. <br><br>From the meat section, the winner from everyone else at the table was the lamb ribs. The pork shank was tender and the naan was great if it came fresh from the oven. The pig face was like a breakfast dish and was ok, and the grilled chicken had a nice rub to it.<br><br>From the goats section, the goat empanadas were deemed alright. Apparently the meat was ok but the empanada shell was tasty. The goat belly was pretty meh and also took a while to come out of the kitchen so we were all pretty stuffed by the end. <br><br>What sets Girl and the Goat apart from the other expensive tapas style restaurants I typically hate is the service. Maybe it's because we were such a large and expensive party, but we got the olive bread on the house. When the goat belly took too long to get to our table, the waitress gave it to us free of charge. Then we had some issues with how hot the restaurant was (heat wave in Chicago today) and had asked the waitress if there was a way to cool it down (there wasn't but she brought lots of ice to us), she politely explained the situation and then gave us two free desserts on the house to make up for the heat.

The egg was overcooked though and they dont put enough of the sauces it needs a lot of tje maple syrup and a lot of the aioli to make the dish work i would ask for extra maple syrup and aioli on the side <br><br>Goat neck $27 was good not great idk if it was the yogurt or the beans but that was the only thing with flavor the goat is tender but not flavorful just was expecting more<br><br>Chocolate pavlova $11: tasty its not to sweet the black sessame makes it taste like popcorn the meringue was crispy.

We ordered a bunch of smaller plates for sharing.<br><br>We started out with the olive focaccia bread served with a yuzu-harissa butter and lime olive oil.  The olive pieces soaked up the lime olive oil flavors and the yuzu-harissa butter was unique and delightful.  I absolutely loved every second of this dish being an olive lover.  I don't see harissa on many \"New American\" menus so I appreciated the uniqueness of it.  <br><br>The second plate consisted of raw oysters served with a lemon mignonette.  The oysters were so fresh and some of the best tasting oysters I have ever had in Chicago.  The mignonette was a wonderful complement to the more intense oyster flavors.  The oysters were just the beginning of our adventures with seafood that night.<br><br>The grilled cuttlefish was also a unique assortment of flavors.  It was good but I wasn't taken by anything really.  I did really like the hot mustard and pistachio lemon relish.  The fingerling potatoes were a nice texture addition to the different texture of the cuttlefish pieces.  The cuttlefish had a really nice texture and was grilled, but had more of a subtle flavor.<br><br>My favorite dish of the night were the potato blue cheese pierogies.  If you knew me, you'd be surprised that this was my favorite dish because compared to the other dishes, the flavors weren't super unique, but it just all blended really well together and tasted delicious.  The blue cheese was a zesty, exciting flavor paired with the more mild potato flavor.  I really loved the maitake mushrooms served on top of the apple relish.  I am not super into apples but I really enjoyed the relish because it wasn't dominated by the apples.<br><br>We ordered the sautéed green beans as a side because the server had raved about them.  But I was kind of underwhelmed by them.  They were not super flavorful and were a bit bland for my tastes.  They weren't extremely bland but just not that great.  I did like the cashews but the fish sauce could have been stronger.<br><br>We ended our meal with the Calamari Bruschetta, which was also another highlight.  The calamari was sautéed perfectly and was served on top of the goat milk ricotta and apples.  It was not your typical bruschetta and I appreciated how creative of an approach this was.  I am not crazy about apples but the goat milk ricotta was heavenly.  <br>Unfortunately, we were too full for dessert because we had too many small plates.<br><br>I did really enjoy this experience but probably hyped it up too much in my head.  I think there are other restaurants in this echelon that have more options for me and have more exciting flavors.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PlQjxXWSUGLk8OLBipo4bA/348s.jpg", "caption": "Olive Yuzu Focaccia"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/p-dWSoCk-AUexxVPFmJWvA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Raw oysters"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fL0Z9-f6OiIcFU85BOgz7w/168s.jpg", "caption": "Grilled Cuttlefish"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Heard a lot about this restaurant, wanted to see the hype and here for a birthday celebration.<br><br>Service: 3.5/5 stars, <br>reservations @10p.

We started with the hamachi crudo, light and refreshing and perfect for the hot sunny afternoon. Next was the goat empanadas, because why would you come here and not order goat?! I could tell the difference in taste from your typical beef or chicken, but it wasn't bad in any way, just unique. The blueberry salsa was probably my favorite part. Then we had the escargot ravioli. I would've never ordered this on my own but I'm glad that my boyfriend did! It's served in this bacon tamarind broth but it really reminded me of minestrone from its smell and color. I think the crispy onions were the perfect touch. Last but certainly the best item of the night, wood oven roasted pig face!

For the other plates, we did the hamachi crudo, pan-fried shishito peppers, braised beef tongue, and goat empanadas. Everything was very good. I liked the empanadas the best, with the shishito peppers a close second. For the price, the hamachi seemed a little on the skimpy side, but it was delicious... I don't think I'd order it again, though.<br><br>I felt myself getting full halfway through the goat empanadas (our last plate), so the server was spot-on with her ordering quantity suggestion. <br><br>All in all, I would say that Girl & the Goat came pretty close to living up to the hype.

This is heavier than the term bruschetta may lead you to believe. The squid had a dark sweet flavor. While the squid was well cooked and made a good compliment on top of the bread, this dish was almost too heavy. <br><br>Pig Face: Again I'm not sure if expectation was the enemy here. The pieces of pork were crispy with a sunny side up egg on top. It was reminiscent of a hash.

There were some tiny missteps with food, but the service, atmosphere and overall quality did not go unnoticed. <br><br>First and foremost, this was some of the best, non-fussy service I've ever experienced. We had a very knowledgeable, friendly server; she kept our water and wine glasses filled. (We ordered a bottle of white, which was kept on ice throughout the meal--nice touch!) <br><br>The cadence of the meal was perfection! Usually with small plates, you get a hodgepodge of whatever comes out of the kitchen first. This felt like we got a staged, 5-course meal of small plates, one right after another, with courses cleared in between. Small details, but they certainly enhance the experience of the meal. <br><br>The food! Our first \"course\" was the sweet onion bread, which came with a salmon cream cheese and pickle relish. The bread was excellent--you could taste the onion in the bread. The salmon cream cheese was really really subtle; my friend is a huge smoked salmon fan, and she couldn't really taste it. I personally loved the subtlety; it was like putting lobster butter on bread. The pickle relish was great, too! It added a nice tang and spice to the dish. <br><br>The goat empanadas are really yummy! The empanada itself is good, but not exceptional...but I did like what came with it; the addition of pineapple and blueberry was surprising, but it worked SOOO well! Very tasty! <br><br>Then came the pan-fried shishito peppers. A good dish! I wouldn't have ever thought to combine parmesan cheese and miso, but it worked! There was a bit too much of the cheese for our liking, but the peppers were nicely cooked and it was unique combination of flavors! <br><br>Then we had the escargot ravioli, which was one of our least favorite dishes. The broth was rich, but the bacon made it too salty; it tasted like it had been over-reduced. It also had an unpleasant sour flavor. Pasta of the ravioli was nicely-cooked! <br><br>The highlight was the pig face--it was like breakfast for dinner on a plate. The egg was a tad overcooked, but the crispy pig face was really good, and the subtle taste of maple was really yummy. And the potato stix gave it a nice salty crunch. Highly highly recommend!<br><br>We also got dessert. We tried the caramel corn and malt balls, and as a thank you from the kitchen, they gave us a small tasting portion of the lemon pound cake. (Very nice touch!) <br><br>The caramel corn and malt ball dish is suuuuuuuper sweet and very rich. I only had a couple bites. The caramel corn is very good, but the malt cream was a bit too rich. It also came with some sort of salty, chewy, taffy-like candies(?) which made it a few ingredients too many. Decent dessert, but a bit decadent. <br><br>I devoured the lemon pound cake! It was super light and tasty; the ice cream it came with was perfection! We thought it was avocado, but apparently it's a sorrel ice cream! It gave it a really nice fresh kick to the dish--highly highly recommend! <br><br>Overall, top notch service, great food, and for the amount of food we got plus a bottle of wine, for the quality, the price tag was not as bad as we expected! <br><br>Still a special occasion place, but worth the visit and the hype!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "My husband and I arrived early before they opened hoping to get a seat at the bar because we didn't have reservations.

Stephanie Izard, top chef winner and Chicago native, has outdone herself with an innovative menu of family style small plates/tapas with bold flavors and Mediterranean influence. Whether you are an adventurous eater, ready to indulge in duck toungues, roasted pig face, and goat empanadas or you love more traditional fare such as succulent ramp marinated chicken, tender baby short ribs, and sautéed green beans, Girl and the Goat has something delicious for everyone. A dining experience at Girl and the Goat, located in the trendy west loop, is highly coveted, so make sure to make a reservation well in advance. We made our reservation a few months in advance on OpenTable. Initially there were only reservations available at 10:45 pm on Thursday, however we checked back and reservations opened up. We ended up making a reservation at 7:30 pm on Thursday. They were very busy but we were seated quickly. There are plenty of tables throughout the restaurant and also communal style seating on a long booth in the center of the restaurant, which is where we were seated. <br>The server explained the menu, that a group of two diners typically orders four to six dishes to be shared and that the dishes would be served starting with the lightest and ending with heaviest. Some dishes can also be served as half orders which was advantageous for myself since my dining companion has an aversion to seafood while I love it and wanted to try a little bit of everything. Most dishes range from $12-$28 a piece. <br><br>The goat empanadas, piqued our interest and we were so glad we ordered these as they were one of our favorite items that we tried here. The goat empanadas were served as two, with miso-blue alioli, chanterelle mushrooms and apple giardiniera. The sauce was so flavorful and the goat meat was tender and delicious. If you have never consumed goat meat before, it's almost reminiscent of pulled pork, very tender, flavorful, and delicious. <br><br>Next up were the chickpea fritters, served with quinoa tabbouleh, chickpeas, pomegranate seeds, feta, and a tahini vinaigrette. The combination of flavors was amazing. The fritter had a polenta or tofu like texture. The sauce was delicious. Next we had the green garli pierogies, served with a scallion sour cream, and tomato rhubarb relish, very tasty. <br><br>Service has the illusion of being attentive as there were certain employees throughout the restaurant who's only responsibility was keeping everyone's water glass filled and plate-ware and utensils fresh and clean. However, our main waiter never came back and checked on us throughout the entire meal after the first initial order taking, even though he checked on the family next to us several times. I had to wave him down to add a couple seafood dishes to the order and a cocktail. <br><br>I ordered the fried oysters. They were delicious! If you've never had fried oysters, I'd equate them to the flavor and texture of a fried mushroom. I also had a half order of scallops, which was one scallop, since my friend doesn't like seafood. The scallop was garnished with brown butter alioli, blood orange, smoked beet, and pistachios. The flavors and garnishing was great but I actually thought the scallop was slightly undercooked. <br><br>Next up were the crispy beef short ribs, my other favorite menu item, served with avocado and grapefruit. The meat was melt in your mouth tender...so delicious. Finally we were served the ramp marinated grilled chicken, a very generous portion, large enough to be a meal of its own, served with shaved carrots, red peppers, and spicy peanut crunch. Bone-in chicken was fall off the bone tender and the combination of flavors was unique and delicious. I also really enjoyed the cocktail that I ordered, It's Always Sunny in Oaxaca, mezcal, mango, turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, and cayenne...subtly spicy and very tasty. I would definitely order this again. A couple next to us ordered the pork shank, a very large generous portion, served with pita bread and various dipping sauces which looked and smelled amazing. I will definitely be ordering the pork shank upon my next visit. <br>The family next to us, was offered a complimentary dessert by our same waiter, even though they said they were too full. However, we were not offered a complimentary dessert. It seemed like when I had inquired about half orders, in regards to seafood, that our waiter toned down the service which doesn't seem right since we spent $136 on our total bill between the two of us. If we had been checked on at least once throughout our entire visit, my review would have been 5 stars. Despite the service, the food was innovative, unique, and delicious and I would still return.

Everything is amazing. Their flavor combinations are next level good. Perfect balance of acid and sweet and savory. We started with the chickpea fritter. Such an explosion of flavors. The yogurt and chutney and pomegranate gave a splashy counterpoint to the smooth, creamy chickpea. We could have had that a few times over, but we wanted to explore the menu. Next was the smoked apple pierogi. Much more subtle. The smoky, cheesy pierogi balanced by the fruit relish. The goat empanadas are a must. Sweet meat with the perfect cheese and a little acid from the sauce. Next was the bucatini. Our server (Lauren - so friendly and helpful) advertised it as comfort food and it did not disappoint. Hearty, rich and filled with flavor. Last entree was the wood oven roasted pig face. Set aside the image that conjures and order it. It's designed to evoke a breakfast hash and it's the best you've had. Just a perfect combination of flavor and texture, and the egg ties it all together. For dessert, the aw honey honey was ethereal, airy and crunchy and not-too-sweet. We also tried the sticky tasty yummy toffee thing ... So good. Richer than the honey honey, but not too sweet or overwhelming. You'll see in the pictures that we usually dug in before I remembered to take a picture. The visual appeal Lisa consistently strong. So, go. Trust your server and order anything that has a single ingredient you like.

It's kind of hard to mess up bread. The feta was a nice touch, I preferred it to butter. It's just so foreign to me that we pay for bread? I don't know. <br><br>Next, came the duck tongues. Can I just the idea of duck tongues is morbidly hilarious? All these ducks with no tongues. Anyway, they tasted like French fries that had been cooked in duck oil. To be honest, that might have been a better way to make this dish, rather than what was served. It captured my interest at first, but was no longer fun after the first couple tongues. I was more interested in the tuna chunks. I would hardly call it \"poke\" though. That's rude.<br><br>We got the crispy beef short ribs next. Honestly, the star of the whole dinner. I highly recommend this. I really enjoy how they made the meat crispy without overtly frying it. What magic. The relish of avocado and the ruby red grapefruit chermoula really completed the taste of it. This was the peak of the dinner.<br><br>After that, we received the scallops. They were okay. I couldn't really taste the aioli or blood orange. Just you're usual ole scallops. <br><br>The pan-roasted bass was decent. I'm Chinese-Filipino, so I really appreciated the pork belly adobo. The sticky rice-coconut jus did not have enough coconut to it. Starfruit was interesting but tasty. The bass, however, left much to be desired. Unmemorable. Like, as I write this review, I literally cannot remember what it tasted like. <br><br>The dishes are tiny as heck, especially for the price. Maybe the experience was dampened not only by the wait, but earlier in the day, we had the best dim sum I've ever had in my life, and for six of us, it came out to $21 each. It was more than enough food. Here, for three, it came out to around $39 each for three people, and we were just barely full. The portions are TINY. Three scallops?<br><br>The restaurant boasts \"global influence,\" and it's really sad because a lot of these dishes should not cost as much as they do. Butter chicken? Adobo? Come on now. My mom makes better adobo than this and for a lot cheaper. I wouldn't come here again unless someone else paid for me. It's a shame because there are so many good looking dishes on the menu, but it's another case of expectations vs. reality. Maybe we were just unlucky or something because I'm desperately trying to like it as all the previous reviewers did.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "One of the best restaurants I've ever been too.

Once we booked our trip to Chicago, I knew I had to get a reservation at this restaurant so we got booked our reservation several months in advance. Below are a few dishes we enjoyed:<br><br>Calamari Bruschetta - When I was reading reviews of this restaurant, I instantly knew we had to try this dish. I was so glad I did because it was amazing! The flavors melt in your mouth and the bread was perfectly toasted. Definitely order this dish! <br><br>Pan Roasted Halibut - The fish was perfectly pan roasted and the flavors of the vegetables worked really well with the dish. <br><br>Wood Grilled Broccoli - This vegetable dish was recommended by the staff and I can see why. It sounds simple - just broccoli, right? But, when you mix the broccoli with some cheese and crispies, it's a game changer! This is the perfect dish to complement the heavier flavors of the other dishes.<br><br>Woodfire Glazed Lamb Ribs - Another amazing dish! The ribs were perfectly marinated and cooked to perfection. It wasn't too gamey in flavor. Highly recommend this if you like lamb! <br><br>Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face - Several reviews mention this dish as their favorite dish. If you've ever had a fried egg with pork belly, the flavors are pretty similar to this dish. Overall, this dish was good but not amazing in my opinion. It may also be because it was our last dish of the night and we were pretty impressed with their other dishes.  <br><br>Goat Empanadas - When they have an entire menu on the side dedicated to goat dishes, we knew we had to at least order one to try it out. The empanada was perfectly crispy on the outside and the filling inside was amazing. It's a bit pricey considering it only comes with 2 but the it was pretty good. The pineapple-blueberry salsa was really refreshing and was a nice spin to the dish. <br><br>I would recommend making reservations beforehand because this restaurant was completely packed on a weekday night. Prices are pretty reasonable for the quality of their dishes.

You had to go to the website, click, hover, wait and wait for a good reservation to open up on Open Table. The first reservation that I got was 10:00pm, then 9:00pm, the best one that I kept was 8pm. <br><br>We arrived half an hour early and thanks to the table that left before us, our table was ready in 5 minutes.

The menu is farm-friendly and vegetarian friendly. The food was rich, unctuous and very novel.<br><br>We ordered: <br>1) The escargot ravioli, which had a surprisingly palate cleansing seafood taste compared the savory rich bacon-y pig-bone broth that the escargot was bathing in. I was so enamored with the sauce that I tried to drink it. DON'T. Its very salty.<br><br>2) Duck tongues- I loved this! The duck tongues were fried bits of protein with a spicy piri piri sauce and mixed with tuna and black bean. It was very appetizing, spicy and refreshing and so unique! Something that I've never had before.<br><br>3) Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face. I thought this would arrive on the pig's head. Surprise! Instead, the pig's face is boiled down, flattened like a hamburger and has a sunny side egg on top. This tasted like simmered savory bacon and that runny egg mixed so well with the pig face. <br><br>4) Beef tongue. This was a like a deconstructed beef tongue tortilla/taco. Beef tongue with crispy tortillas, beef vinaigrette and salsa verde. This was an excellent way to eat savory tender beefy tongue. We put the tongue slices on the tortilla with salad and salsa verde. I wanted a whole bowl of this for myself.<br><br>5) Crisp braised pork shank. This was the best version of pork shank that I've ever had. The pork shank was tender, fall off the bone and the outer parts crisped in jus and butter. The fresh piece of buttery soft naan was perfect to roll up bits of the pork and stone fruit kimchee.

So difficult to even find a seat at the bar. Definitely make reservations for this place more than a day in advance, because they seem to be consistently booked several days in advance. <br><br>String beans (4.5/5) - String beans are simple, but this dish packs a punch! Definitely a lot of flavor going on here with the fish sauce vinaigrette. The cashews also add a nice crunchy texture to the dish but I don't feel like that was needed for texture as the beans were already crunchy, which is a good thing for beans! Crunchy beans are the best and indicates the beans were cooked properly. Just a little too saucy for me, but I still highly recommend this dish as a starter<br><br>Escargo Ravioli (2.5/5) - I was unfortunately not impressed with this dish. You get 6 ravioli which were super thin and I could barely tell there was any escargot in here. The bacon tamarind sauce, crispy onions, and celery also just added too much  'diced/firm' texture to the dish, so I felt it was unneeded and there were just too many elements going on. This also contributed to the plating that was not very refined because they were trying to incorporate too many elements and ended up putting it together kinda sloppily. My biggest cripe though, is that this dish was too salty. Some dishes are on the salty side, but this was too much.<br><br>Pork Shank (4/5) - This is a large shank that comes with butternut squash kimchi (it's not really kimchi but rather pickled without the spiciness/acidic flavor). The pork is deep fried very quickly, so the outside is crispy. I like this unique manner in which this pork is prepared, however, I feel like it falls short just a bit. Reason being if you happen to take a piece of the pork tha tis all on the outside, you're just gonna get the skin and it tastes very very dry and grindy. You really have to cut the pork in a manner in which you get the inner soft parts, but also outer crispy parts. I would like to see the chefs cut it for you, but in a deeper 'score' like manner such that the presentation of the entire shank is still maintained, but it's cut in a way you'll fully enjoy the taste. Either way, the flavors of this dish is really solid<br><br>Goat belly (5/5) - By far my favorite dish of the night. It's a very small portion, but executed with so much thought and finesse. This goat belly is served with lobster, crab, and fennel. It's almost like a surf and turf, with a lot more thought behind it (Rather than just throwing meat and seafood on a dish). The goat belly was rich, but the addition of the crab and lobster provides a refreshing lightness that tones down and complements the richness of the goatbelly. The fennel added a really nice texture and rounded out the profile of the dish overall.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fBh_EalqX3uWx6yXpAkogA/348s.jpg", "caption": "string beans. highly recommend!"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8xh6OaSyO6NV_HAcD2htpg/168s.jpg", "caption": "lamb shank. flash deep fried. not bad."}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CabzLb0BNIICG4sv0IRnyA/168s.jpg", "caption": "goat belly. highly recommend, but don't expect a good portion. just for taste"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "I'll start things off with a quick warning, reservations fill up 2-3 weeks before the day.

The signs are super confusing anyway with arrows pointing in both directions, guaranteeing some sort of major mess-up for you and a nice ticket from the government. I suggest you take public transportation, Uber, or take advantage of the curbside valet parking.<br><br>AMBIANCE/SERVICE:<br>----------------------<br>The decor is simple and cozy. The girl and goat painting near the front is super cool, deviant art-like. All the staff are wearing shirts that display goats doing cute/funny things. Clever!<br><br>Service is absolutely on point. I had to bring this up before the food section, because flawless service is key to the dining experience here and we were not disappointed. There are so many items it can be intimidating to navigate the menu, especially since two of us have food allergies, but our server easily guided us along with recommendations and items that could not be eaten. He even organized our dishes to be sent out in optimal succession. Also as each dish was placed before us, it was announced as safe/not safe for my friend who has an allergy to certain forms of fish. Super critical and effortlessly delivered. Thank you!<br><br>FOOD/DRINK:<br>--------------<br>And the best way to kick off said dinner? How about *The Very Old Fashioned* featuring J. Henry \"Blind Goat\" bourbon (crafted specifically for this restaurant)? Yes, we'll take a round. Very smooth and complemented the dishes very nicely.<br><br>Now let's get to the food.<br><br>*Duck Tartare* with gooseberries, pickled mushrooms, gochujang mayo, cracklins, duck dad lavish - Great start to the meal. Not overwhelming in flavor, good texture.<br><br>* Hamachi Crudo* with crisp Pork belly, chili aioli, caperberries - Sliced perfectly thin and I enjoyed the contrast in texture of the other elements in the dish. <br><br>*Duck Tongues* with tuna and black bean poke and piri piri chili powder - Crispy and flavorful, but not my favorite dish. The tongues were a bit chewier than I would have liked.<br><br>*Roasted Beets* with green beans, white anchovy (on the side for us), avocado creme fraiche, bread crumbs - LOVE! I'm a huge fan of beets, and these were prepared perfectly.<br><br>*Goat Liver Mousse* with pickled rhubarb, giardiniera, bread & butter, pickles - Super buttery, creamy, and everything you're missing in your life if you like liver. That mousse is bomb! And don't forget the super buttery popovers too. Nommm.<br><br>*Wood Grilled Broccoli* with rogue smokey bleu, spiced crispies - Why are all the veggies here so darn good? Another great dish that goes well with everything. Spiced crispies on point.<br><br>*Calamari Bruschetta* with clam baguette, goat milk ricotta, goat bacon, green tomatoes - This dish is heavier in flavor than the others, or maybe this is because I'm starting to feel STUFFED around this point in the meal.<br><br>*Pan Roasted Halibut* with marcona almond butter, white asparagus, blueberry nuoc clam - Bursting with flavor! Although I'm super full already by now, I'm still going because this dish is so tasty. If you like Halibut, get this.<br><br>*Roasted Cauliflower* with pickled peppers, pine nuts, mint - I said it before and I'll say it again. They nailed all the veggies! <br><br>*Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face* with sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine-maple, potato stix - Pig Face is life. Even though I feel like I have no room left in my tummy, somehow I'm able to keep eating this. Super delicious and savory in all the right ways!<br><br>*Crisp Braised Pork Shank* with buttermilk dressing, grilled spring onion and radish kimchi, naan - Extremely crispy skin and quite the chunk of meat. We could barely finish this dish, it pretty much owned us. I think I prefer the Pig Face to this dish, but many of the others liked this one more.<br><br>SUMMARY: 11 dishes, 6 people, $57 each including tax and tip.

Delicious fish dish. <br><br>But honestly you have to get the pig face. It sounds scary but it's so approachable. It's like breakfast.

The roe popping in your mouth added the brine that broke through the sour sauce. Pretty decent but not something you need to order.<br><br>Shishito Peppers: Tons of shishito peppers even for a half order with some bread crumbs and sauce. The shishito peppers were tender and a great side dish for any dish. The sauce had some depth to it that matched the bread crumbs heaviness, which I felt made the dish so great.<br><br>Roasted Beets: Beets are so appealing to me now and I loved the avocado sauce in it. The beets and the green beans just worked with the avocado sauce.<br><br>Lamb Ribs: Didn't feel lamb-y at all. It tasted like any fall-off-the-bone ribs with a sweet sauce with some sliced green onions. The 4 ribs were a bit fatty but nothing I didn't expect.

I mean, it's the most reviewed restaurant in Chicago. When a place is THAT popular, I tend to like it less. It's like with the super popular kids in high school. When they already have so many fans, how does my fandom make a difference? I'm merely just another number on the growing list. <br><br>I'm from LA. I had heard about girl and the goat before moving to Chicago. It was at the top of my list of restaurants to try like everyone else. My very first time dining here was in 2013. My fiancé's cousin made a reservation for us. That dinner was exquisite. We loved it. Since then, the number of times I've been here is in the double digits. When you have a homogenous group of friends back in LA, everybody who visits Chicago wants to try the place. At one point, I was scared to come back and would tell my friends I'd meet up for drinks after their dinner . After all, it's not a cheap place either. My feelings for girl and the goat have not been consistent over the years. There have been times when I didn't care for the dishes. Don't get me wrong, nothing was bad, I just wasn't impressed. Sure, my standards are higher for a restaurant that's as hyped as this. However, service was always top notch even though the place was non-stop bustling. <br><br>I often review restaurants after trying it once. That one time could've been really good, or it might've been an off night, and it was terrible. Maybe they're consistently good. Or consistently bad. But for most of the time, I don't have that information to fully assess the place b/c I don't dine there enough. However across the many dining experiences I've had here, I can confidently say that girl and the goat truly lives up to its hype! My favorites are their desserts and cocktails. That butterscotch crumble is phenomenal. Every cocktail I've tried is tasty. And I've tried a lot of drinks here. I've also sampled different dishes since their menu rotates. I'd say the standouts are probably what everyone else loves - wood oven roasted pig face, grilled octopus, roasted beets, roasted cauliflower with pickled peppers. I'm not a fan of lamb but my fiancé is crazy about it. He's tried everything from the goat carpaccio to liver mousse, confit goat belly and empanadas and has nothing but great things to say. <br><br>Needless to say, I'm a huge fan. Make your reservation months in advance so you don't miss out on the most reviewed restaurant in Chicago. It's most reviewed for a very good reason.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Okay, so where do I start? I came here with my bf to celebrate his graduation.

Miraculously a reservation came up for 9:45 on the day of and it would be perfect timing based on her flight. With all my good luck of being able to score a reservation literally hours before I should've gone to the casino. <br><br>Anyways, first comment is going to be about the ambiance. The atmosphere is GREAT. I loved it here. It was lively. Although we didn't have the best seat in the house, I still felt like there was never a dull moment of silence due to the great ambiance. <br><br>Service was phenomenal too. Waiter was very attentive even to the tiniest of details with much wit as well. Water was constantly poured. Although service could've been a bit quicker, I am not going to complain due to the restaurants business. <br><br>For drinks I got my go to drink, the Old Fashion. I really enjoyed. Just wish there weren't so many ice cubes in my drink....drives me insane when that happens...especially at a nice place like Girl and the Goat.<br><br>Now on to what matters, the food! <br><br>First we got the Chickpea Fritters. When I think of Chickpeas I think of those circle things in middle eastern food. But this dish came out in tofu like squares. And it was extremely delicious! With the fruit it had the perfect balance! 5 out of 5 stars!<br><br>Second we got the Hamachi Crudo. This was a dish out of left field. The waiter recommended it to us. After we had it I questioned to my friend if waiters/waitresses get commission based on what doesn't sell well. Lol. This dish just didn't mesh at all with the rest of the dishes that were on the menu. It was like eating sashimi at a steak place. It was just weird. Wasn't a fan. 3 out of 5 stars. <br><br>Third we got the Goat Empanadas. I have no idea what goat tastes like but this dish was great. Extremely tasty balance of everything on it was GREAT. 5 out of 5 stars. <br><br>4th Dish. Wood roasted pig face. Did I tell you I love pork? I love pork. This dish was great. Crispy melt in your mouth pork. Sooooo good. I don't even know what pig face would taste like but after having pig face here, I'm getting pig face everywhere. 5 out of 5 stars. <br><br>5th Dish. Crisp Braised Pork Shank. This was a really good dish. The naan was surprisingly incredible that came with it. I really liked the buttermilk dressing with the Naan but the buffalo kimchi sauce...did not taste anything like kimchi. It was weird. 4.5 out of 5 stars. I think the execution could be better but I ain't no master chef so don't take this too seriously. <br><br>Dessert we got Blueberry Bourbon baba again recommended by our waiter. Again, I think he takes a commission for what doesn't sell. This dish was not good. It tasted weird. The bourbon made the dish extremely sour. It just didn't mesh in my mouth. Blah. 2.5 out of 5 stars. <br><br>All in all I had a great experience. I wish we ordered more variety because the 2 pork dishes we ordered at the end seemed a bit too much. Something was missing from the 5 dishes we ordered. Maybe take out the Hamachi and go with a veggie dish or a seafood/pasta dish. All in all a solid experience.

I was lucky enough to book 3 seats but took me a month in advance.<br><br>This restaurant is great in all aspects. Their service is on point with everything. They bring out their dishes one after another and present each one along with it's ingredients. This restaurant is family-style so most dishes are shared and are at a small portion. Me and my friends decided to order two each from their unique menu.<br><br>We started with goat empanadas which the meat was tender and full of flavor. It had the texture of pulled pork. Next, came the thick scallop cubes which were meaty and sautéed to perfection. Third, came the escargot ravioli which had this nice garlic sauce and along came pig hearts which were tiny and slightly meaty. The hearts were grilled but wasn't worth it to me (Too pricey for something tiny..literally). The pig face came next which was one of my favorites. The egg yolk on top breaks within the meat and provides this nice texture. The meat is full of flavor and has this fatty taste which is delicious. Finally the last part but my favorite, the pork shank which is a deep fried whole pork shank similar to Filipino style crispy pata. The meat is tender inside but crispy from the outside. The naan could be a lot better; it was a bit bland and too soft which to me, didn't pair well. <br><br>Overall, this place is definitely worth it and a must eat in Chi-town. Don't leave this city without eating here. The menu is unique and their bartenders do an excellent job with cocktails. I suggest ordering some drinks and sipping it at the bar before getting seated.

Read on for details.<br><br>When I knew I was going to visit Chicago, it was a requirement to visit G&TG. Stephanie Izard has been my favorite Top Chef since her first appearance and just to dine in one of her restaurants has been a dream of mine. I showed up, sans reservations, and was able to find a place at the bar extension. My waiter gave me a menu and put a dot next to which items could be ordered in half-sizes. He suggested that I order four things, so I ordered:<br>- sauteed green beans (half order)<br>- wood grilled broccoli (half order)<br>- springy focaccia<br>- goat empanada (half order)<br><br>The man next to me had also ordered the green beans and I realized once his were delivered that a half order would be way too much for me. I jokingly said that we should have shared one order, and he agreed. A few minutes later, another man sat down across from us, also on his own and sitting at the bar. After my next course was delivered, a woman sat to my right and the four of us started chatting. I shared my broccoli and focaccia with our group and we all tasted sips of each others drinks. Slowly but surely, we added to our ragtag group of Misfit Toys until there were 9 of us passing our apps and drinks, insisting that everyone get a bite of this or that. Not counting the drinks, by the end of the night I had also tasted:<br>- shishito peppers<br>- escargot ravioli<br>- seared diver scallops<br>- duck tartare<br>- blueberry bourbon baba<br>....and so many others that I forgot to write down. <br><br>It got to the point where even our fearless bartender started throwing extra servings our way to accommodate the growing crowd of strangers. <br><br>This was, by far, the most expensive meal I've ever eaten solo. Granted, I did spend $20 on spices to bring home and another $30 on drinks, so I guess it actually wasn't that expensive.<br><br>I know firsthand now why Stephanie is both a Top Chef and Iron Chef victor. These bites were delectable and my only regret is that it will be a while before I can try them again.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/z1sP1Tq0t9nyMZCJy2wqNQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "Escargot ravioli (again from Alli, compliments of the bartender)"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Y7qEh4qe4TKPhsaPisKjgQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Duck tartar (from Alli)"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yW9khQOBZr_ZFzVuSyg8pg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Blueberry bourbon baba"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Wow!   Everything exceeded our expectations beyond anything we could have hoped.  Service.  Food.  Experience.

It's the most yelped restaurant in all of Chicago and the co-owner/chef -<br>Stephanie Izard, just took the Iron Chef Gauntlet crown 4 days ago. Is this enough to convince you to try this place out?<br><br>We knew it was going to be hard to score a table without any reservations so we moved around our schedule and made sure to arrive here by 4:30pm (right when they open). We were 10 mins early and there were already a few parties inside waiting. Already a crowd waiting before opening? I already knew I was in for a sweet deal. When they were ready to seat people, we checked in and they had a communal table open for us. This was a pretty cool concept as they sat parties of 2 at a long table that could seat 8 in total. This gives the opportunity to mingle and talk with those around you and also gives you a sneak peak of the action in the kitchen.<br><br>Our server was great - gave us some recommendations and every dish that was brought out was quickly briefed to us on what was in it/how to eat it. If you're coming with a friend, the suggestion is to order 4 total dishes to share. Everything is family style here and is meant for sharing. Apparently, the most popular dish here is the Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face, but the Crisp Braised Pork Shank is also up there and since our server couldn't help us decide between the two, we decided to get both! Along with these two, we ordered the Pan Roasted Halibut and the Escargot Ravioli. <br><br>The first dish to come out was the Escargot Ravioli. The ravioli is paired with a very rich, salty broth, as well as some fried onions sprinkled on top. The broth though salty, had an interesting flavor, one that we've never had before. It was also our first time trying escargot and it had a unique taste to it. I think the broth was the main component to this dish - it really tied all the flavors together. Was the escargot amazing? Good, but not amazing, in my opinion. The Pan Roasted Halibut was second, and this had a mix of mushrooms and asparagus all paired with an Asian fusion peanut sauce. It was a nice juicy piece of halibut which I appreciated!<br><br>Now, the dishes that stole our hearts: Pig Face and Pork Shank.... The Roasted Pig Face was so unique and flavorful that we were too scared to finish the plate. Every bite was more delicious than the last. The Pig Face gets its name from the patty that is made by the meat from a pigs head. It's meant to eat like a hash, so you mix together the patty with a sunny side up egg as well as the crunchy potato strings. They really hit it out of the park with this one, if you're having a hard time deciding what to order, do yourself a favor and order this. Truly phenomenal. The Pork Shank was no laughing matter either. It came with a side of naan and the pork was fall off the bone, with a crispy skin all around. Every piece was juicy and tender. It was paired with two dipping sauces, but we felt the pork was better by itself. <br><br>Overall, this restaurant definitely lives up to it's fame. My only complaints would be small portions and high prices. However, given the setting and the quality of the food, that's expected. We can see why you would need to reserve months in advance to get a table here. Will be back for some pig face!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AlHP4mRFXGRZzGfU64iMyQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "Sweet and Spicy Brioche Bread"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ejASYRMSLQU0lpFTwgp4XA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Escargot Ravioli"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vcwJeulfsvgiLGEKIckpCQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Pan Roasted Halibut"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Had an absolutely amazing experience here. The ambience is warm, the service friendly and the food bountiful and savoury. I can't remember the last time I had such a wonderful experience accompanied by great food. We made reservations approx 3 weeks in advance. If you are dining with 1 other person, ask for the \"chef's table\". Essentially, this is a front row seat by the open kitchen and grants you and your guest the opportunity to watch the kitchen staff of about 10 chefs (5 men, 5 women) put together some of the most wonderful food creations known to mankind. The great thing? We did not ask for the chef's table but were graciously afforded this opportunity...just because. Since we had to wait (all of 10 mins) to be seated our waiter said that we would get a dish \"on the house.\" Well, that could not have been further from the truth. We ordered 5 share dishes off the menu...and got 10. Outstanding. The 5 extra menu items were called \"minis\" which meant the dishes were not full courses. Could have fooled me. Although we were 2, we were unable to finish any of our dishes. So, be prepared to deal with first world issues of the inability to eat everything on your plate. Since this was one meal in a lifetime, I was not guilted into thinking about world hunger and enjoyed the sumptuous spread. Everything from the broccoli to the cauliflower to the sweet onion bread was amazing.  There are many choices for the vegetarian, considering my guest and I do not eat chicken, beef or goat.  You are bound to find something you like on their electic menu.  Wish this experience could be gotten in Toronto... Well, on the off chance Girl and The Goat (GATG) was thinking to expand its borders, I did invite its owner to consider opening up shop in Toronto.

We came in, gave my name that the reso was under, and were seated almost immediately. The vibe was super chill and casual, and they even had a couch area for people who wanted to lounge around. <br><br>The drink menu was pretty diverse, with a bunch of IPAs and hipster beers, along with your usual wine menu and some pretty unique cocktails. <br><br>Now to the food... the star of the show! Here's the thing, coming into a Top Chef (and now Iron Chef) restaurant, you've got some pretty high expectations. I would say most dishes will definitely blow your tastebuds<br><br>sautéed green beans with fish sauce vinaigrette. cashews: This was simply delicious. Such a simple dish with a few ingredients, but executed so flawlessly. The beans were perfectly cooked, and the fish sauce vinaigrette was not too salty, nor too sweet and went very well with the beans. Cashews added a very nice crunch. Very good portion size for 2. 5/5<br><br>roasted cauliflower with pickled peppers. pine nuts. mint: This was sooo delicious. Who would have thought you could cook vegetables, let alone cauliflower, so flavourful!!! The mint added an amazing punch of flavour, with a nice zing of acidity from the pickled peppers. What a play on textures and flavours! 5/5<br><br>duck tartare gooseberries . pickled mushrooms . gochujang mayo . cracklins . duck fat lavish: Another homerun dish!! The duck tartare was prepared perfectly and garnished with the mayo, mushrooms, gooseberries, etc. on the side so you can mix as much or as little as you wanted to. It came with 3 or 4 big crispy crackers (i.e. cracklins) that you topped with the tartare. It wasn't as gamey as I would have expected and the texture was amazing with so much going on. 5/5<br><br>confit goat belly bourbon butter . lobster and crab . fennel: This was a special of the day at the time, but looks like they may have made it a regular menu item. the goat belly was similar to pork belly, except with a little bit of gaminess. Completely melt in your mouth, and the lobster and crab were also perfectly cooked. Everything in this dish came so well together including the fennel that gave the dish a good crunch and liquorice flavour. Only thing that could have made this better was reducing the amount of butter in the dish... it was literally a pool of butter at the bottom. 5/5 <br><br>wood oven roasted pig face with sunny side egg. tamarind. cilantro . red wine-maple . potato stix: OK. Everyone said this was amazing on the reviews, BUT I would say this was actually the dish we least enjoyed. It was good nonetheless, but maybe it was because we already had so much great food! You mix the egg in with bunch of crispy roasted pig chunks and potato sticks, and sort of becomes a crispy mush. I think it could have used a lot more cilantro to freshen up the overall dish as it was quite rich. 4/5<br><br>chocolatey - chocolate cake shiitake gelato: By dessert, we were insanely stuffed. But we knew we just had to order the most-raved about dessert. Luckily we ordered this cake because it was such an amazing finish to an already great meal. The cake was similar to a chocolate lava cake, with oozy chocolate filling inside. The shiitake gelato tasted EXACTLY like the mushrooms, and it was all topped with a crispy chocolate crunch topping and vanilla cream sauce. I wish I had some of this right now! 5/5<br><br>Overall, the flavours were amazing and the portion sizes were surprisingly large. I think Izard would completely kill it (in a good way) if she were to open a fine-dining establishment. She's got a very unique take on mixing flavours and it seems to be working incredibly well. She's taking risks on flavour and I think that's what makes her a killer chef.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/evjvWwSmKJyTVuAEBxZ_HQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "chocolatey - chocolate cake shiitake gelato"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oexQ-uuEXYnBoU1UodwW2w/168s.jpg", "caption": "confit goat belly bourbon butter . lobster and crab . fennel"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ji5KPPULnVHl3H1xgGQF3w/168s.jpg", "caption": "wood oven roasted pig face with sunny side egg. tamarind. cilantro . red wine-maple . potato stix"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "This place was amazing.

The duck tongue was also another unique concept that we really enjoyed.  All the raw dishes were uniquely prepared and extremely flavorful.  I would really love to try more of the goat themed plates.  <br><br>As for the dessert the malt balls were the extremely unexpected favorite.  The combo of the caramel corn and ice cream was a great surprise.  The tiramisu was served very creatively in a coffee cup, but the flavors were just ok.  I think the milk stout took away from the sweet liquor taste of standard tiramisu.  <br><br>All in all our dining experience at Girl & the Goat was great.  Their menu is extremely creative, and the food was well prepared.  Service is also top notch.  It is a great restaurant, but I wish reservations were more easily accessible.  There are also other restaurants in the city that dish out creative tapas as well as Girl & the Goat, which is why I think it is overhyped a bit!  Everyone who enjoys creative small plates should visit the Goat just once!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NHq3DyqftVKVMJ3ziH3UrQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "Vitelo Tonnato (veal tartare)"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HYeye83i8H_PNDzSQglpHw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Beet Salad"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/188c6RXYNb2POMx7B21bTQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Pig Face"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Visiting from LA I was so excited to find out my friend scored a reservation for the group of us.

We arrived around 8 for a reservation for 8:15, it took us over a half hour to get seated because of the table we were supposed to be seated at was taking their sweet time to leave! So we grabbed a drink at the bar and the hostess came by and explained the menu so we could order once we were seated. Our waiter and host were both very helpful and were trying their best to get the other party moving. Since all items on the menu are shareable items, our host recommended about 5-7 dishes for our party of 4. The menu is divided by Veggies, Fish and Meat entrees which is helpful in ensuring you're able to experience a variety of dishes. Our party of 4 tried 4 entrees (we ordered 2 of the same dishes for a total of 5 entrees).  <br><br>We started with the Goat Empanadas, which were AMAZING. The goat is flavorful and the empanada is just the perfectly crispy, it will literally melt in your mouth. The sea bass was brought out next, it was flaky and flavorful but the aftertaste was a bit off, so out of the 4 dishes, I would say it was my least favorite. Lastly, the calamari bruschetta and the crisp braised pork shank came out together. Both of these were PHENOMENAL. The braised pork shank is cooked to perfection. The pork literally falls off the bone and its paired perfectly with the crispy naan and buttermilk ranch. We ordered two thinking since the dishes are on the smaller side we would need the extra order but boy were we wrong, this has to be one of the largest dishes on the menu and it's easily shareable by a large party (just order extra naan). The calamari bruschetta is also another must try. The calamari is grilled and not fried which is a plus and it is paired with apple, ricotta cheese and goat bacon on top of perfectly toasted bread. It's an amazing combination of flavors and totally unexpected.<br><br>Overall, I would say the food, service and ambience are all a 5/5.

The food here is creative, the ordering system is tapas-esque, and service rivals that of a high Michelin-starred establishment. <br><br>Our table of 7 broke up into groups of 4 and 3. The ordering system threw our groups into disarray, as we weren't sure how much food we would have to order to leave full. However, our waiter was extremely helpful and friendly with us, recommending the popular dishes and greatly calming the chaos. The service stayed consistently excellent throughout our meal.<br><br>My group of 3 ordered the Pan Fried Shishito peppers, Calamari Bruschetta, Escargot Ravioli, Pig Face, Goat Belly, and some Citrus Brioche for some extra carbs. <br><br>Our dishes came out one by one, so we were able to sample everything by itself before polluting our tongues with another flavor. Our favorites were the Pig Face, Calamari Bruschetta, and the Goat Belly. The pan fried peppers had a nice char, roasted flavor to them, and they worked well as a vegetable counterpart to all the meat we ordered. The Escargot Ravioli was disappointing, both in terms of size and flavor. The ravioli were extremely small, and because of this, the escargot wasn't very noticeable. With escargot being such a niche and interesting ingredient, I felt like it could have been highlighted better. The broth that came with the ravioli was arguably the best part of the dish. <br><br>The Pig Face was special. The wonderful egg, the crispy potato, and the pig itself were all extremely memorable. It was our unanimous favorite. The presentation is also stunning in its own right. <br><br>The group of 4 ordered similar dishes, with the addition of the Green Beans and Pork Shank. Both these dishes were delicious as well, and I felt like they were great representations of the quality of Girl and the Goat. <br><br>Is the food pretentious? I suppose it can be to some eyes. The fine line between creativity and pretentiousness is something that Chef Izard handles gracefully, as the food pushes boundaries without seemingly destroying them. <br><br>Our meal wasn't cheap. The per person breakdown was over $30, but I left satisfied knowing I had sampled the amazing variety that Girl and the Goat had to offer. <br><br>In the days afterward, my friend wouldn't stop shouting out \"Pig Face\" whenever I asked him what he wanted to eat.

Next came the calamari bruschetta which was so visually appealing, no less than three people asked what it was. The calamari was some of the freshest I've ever had and paired perfectly with the lightly toasted bread and other toppings. Finally the signature pig's face - not to worry hear, no actual resemblance to the face of a pig - simply some of the best pork anything I have ever had.

I really wanted to try a few other cocktails but we had things to do after our meal. <br><br>Trevor took us through the menu and gave us recommendations and assisted in suggestions and possibilities for my girlfriend's dairy allergy.  He was extremely helpful. This place has small plates that are meant to share with one another, such an awesome concept.  <br><br>We started with the Sourdough Blueberry bread with a homemade Berry lamb jam and Spring onion cream cheese.  She loves bread and we loved this bread, in fact she's going to try and make it at home, good luck babe.  The berry lamb jam was like nothing I've ever had before, I wish they sold jars of it.

My mouth is literally still watering from this dish two weeks later, I was so happy I ordered this.  It was on my radar before arriving to the restaurant after looking at the menu online. I want another one!!  <br>Because this dish was made with butter and my girlfriend couldn't share, our server Trevor dropped off a small portion of the Kohlrabi Salad for her to enjoy.  It was made with Fennel, Evalon, Toasted almonds, Roasted shiitake and Blueberries.  It was such a nice gesture and she really loved the salad while I indulged on my Halibut. She let me try her salad, it was very very good.<br><br>Finally, we ordered the Crisp Braised Pork Shank, with Buttermilk dressing, Grilled spring onion & radish kimchi with Naan.  This was so damn good because of the crispiness on the outside was perfection, very very impressed.  The Naan bread was so fluffy and delicious we almost ordered another piece.  Best Naan we've ever ate, hands down!<br><br>As we were approaching the possibility of dessert, we realized we had to get going to get on our Architectural Boat Tour of the city that was boarding in 20 minutes.  We asked for the check because we didn't have much time, and right before the check arrived, Trevor came by to drop off a side of the blackberry sorbet (I think) because my girlfriend was intrigued by this item.  He really made our dining experience extremely memorable and created this amazing experience for the two of us.  I've been in the industry since 1995 and it's really hard to find great people like him, thank you very much sir we greatly appreciate your whole-hearted customer service! <br><br>Overall:<br>An absolute must try if you're in the city of Chicago!!!  The food was absolutely delicious, flavorful and creative.  Everything was cooked to perfection, the ambiance was very warming and soothing.  The staff was incredible, you can tell how well the staff works together and it really sets the tone for the restaurant.  Kudos to the owner and management for this well oiled machine, you guys are a blessing to society.

Cashews - The server told us this was the only dish on their menu that has been on there since the restaurant opened years ago, so we definitely had to try it especially cause I love green beans and string beans (if you can't tell from all my posts).  The green beans were cooked perfectly.  The fish sauce vinaigrette was so unique as were the addition of cashews.  It wasn't a flavor I've ever tasted before and we loved it.<br>* Escargot Ravioli - Bacon tamarind sauce. Escarole and celery. Crispy onions - I love love love escargots so when I saw this on the menu, I wanted to have it.  I was slightly disappointed cause the bacon tamarind sauce was a bit too salty and you can't taste the escargot (or the typical garlic butter escargots you learn to expect).  I didn't love this dish and the filling was too small for the pasta size.  <br>* Crisp Braised Pork Shank - Buttermilk dressing. Grilled spring onion and radish kimchi. Naan - I love the their take on this.  The pork was crispy on the outside, as if you were eating chicharron.  You can tell it was brasied and then deep fried cause of the perfect soft fall off the bone meat and the crispiness of the skin.  You wrap the meat in naan, though it was more like a pita than a naan, and then you add the radish kimchi sauce, grilled spring onion and you have sorta a \"bao\".  This dished reminded me of the white bao and peking duck AND it tasted like it too.  I liked it.  It was different and a unique combination but the flavors were not anything I haven't experienced before combined.<br><br>I do like the place and the food was good, some dishes better than others.  I would love to come back here and try other dishes they have to offer cause there was so much more to choose from!  The waitress was also tentative, but not overly so, and very friendly.  She didn't force you to order more and was perfectly helpful and courteous.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KRbq1bepUmX5Qu8-PaQdBA/348s.jpg", "caption": "Pork Shank"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xIMeDyke7jeT5rYzvcusdQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Escargot Ravioli"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/E2qgMsQfvzfj9eojrK6JtA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Green beans"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Overstated, overly salted food but always delicious and satisfying.  Great service and good atmosphere!  Great desserts too!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "We are about half way through the year and this had to easily be the best meal I've had in 2018.

Made a reservation 3 months beforehand and our options were already very limited. Basically we chose between a 5pm or 9pm meal so we opted for the latter. The service during our visit was average. Waitress was polite but not particularly friendly.<br><br>For dishes my friend and I semi-shared the following:<br>-Brioche w/ Sambal butter & lamb jam: This place seems to be known for their elevated breads and they did not disappoint. The sambal butter was very light and had the slightest kick to it. It was just the right flavor to balance out the bread's sweetness or to go with the lamb jam. Personally I would have liked it a bit stronger though. The brioche itself is full of butter. The texture is amazing and at the end of your bite, your mouth still has a coat of butteriness enveloping your taste buds. And if that's not enough fatty goodness for you, the lamb jam will give you another dose of fatty sweet flavor. (4/5)<br><br>-Duck Tartare: My absolute favorite dish of the night. I love duck in all it's forms but I've never had it raw and I wish I had tried this sooner. The duck has a bit more bite to it compared to raw beef or fish but it's still not tough. The pickled gooseberries and fried brussels sprouts add a variety of textures and flavors to the dish too. Despite everything that this dish has going on, it's still a very clean tasting dish. Also the duck fat lavash is out of this world. The duck fat in it doesn't make it heavy but it certainly makes them addictive. If I could I would purchase a giant box of these to take home with me and use it on every spread I have (5/5)<br><br>-Goat Liver Mousse: If you don't like goat, can't deal with liver, or all the above, this dish is not for you. However if you love a good pate and can take your gamey meats, this dish will delight your tastebuds. The mousse portion was small because that's all you need but texturally it was so fluffy and creamy. It didn't have any of the grittiness that comes with bad liver. The pickles also added a nice sweet, crunch, sour component to the dish. The mousse was served with the duck fat lavash that I made clear about how obsessed I am with them. They were also served with the warmest, moistest, most delicious crumpets I could ever imagine. (4.5/5)<br><br>-Pig Face: By far my least favorite dish. I didn't hate it but it was just so average. I guess for the price it's not bad and it is filling but I wouldn't waste my 3 month reservation on this dish. (3.5/5)<br><br>-Rhubarb and Goat Cheesecake: Technically my friend's dessert but I took a few bites. It's not quite what I expected but it works. The main thing I noticed is that it's quite a savory cheesecake. It's not very sweet and the various herbal elements remind me more of savory dishes so it didn't quite satisfy my end-of-the-meal sweet tooth. It's still quite tasty but not something I would get again.

The idea behind this restaurant is interesting: it's tapas style, which my husband and I had already experienced at another restaurant called The Purple Pig.<br><br>The menu is simple and broken up into three categorie: meat, fish, and vegan, I believe. We went with the server's recommendations since it was our first time here. We had the appetizer of goat empanadas, and wow, those were delicious!<br><br>We then ordered a vegetable dish that was comprised of green beans and almonds; that was yummy as well.<br><br>I ordered the halibut, and my husband ordered the the goat ribs. The ribs were incredible and fell right off the bone. The halibut was probably my favorite dish of the evening, and it tasted wonderful! Our server informed me that the chef there has the halibut out as a special spring dish. So if you happen to go there during the spring, I highly recommend you order the halibut!<br><br>We tried a different type of dessert. I forget the name of it, but it's the first one on the list. It was definitely interesting and unique, and I'm glad we tried it, but I'm not sure if I would order it again. I am definitely more of a traditional desserts, like cheesecakes, regular cakes, ice cream, things like that.

Due to an event going on downtown that blocked off several streets, my friend was unable to join me for our dinner reservation. My boyfriend was able to come in her place and got there about 30 minutes after my original reservation.  Despite how increasingly busy they were getting, the restaurant was still able to get us a table immediately after he arrived. I appreciated how accommodating the Girl and Goat employees were under these circumstances. <br><br>Cocktails: Pyramid Scheme and Morning Ritual. The Pyramid Scheme is a scotch based cocktail that was more on the fruity side. The smokiness from the scotch was present, but not overwhelming. The Morning Ritual was a great spicy cocktail. <br><br>Chickpea Fritter (10/10): Great Mediterranean style dish with delicious toppings on top of the fritters<br><br>Pan fried shishito peppers (10/10): I never really imagined parmesan, sesame, and miso working well with shishito peppers, but it tasted great. The portion was also generous. <br><br>Grilled Octopus (9/10): The octopus was extremely fresh tasting and cooked perfectly. <br><br>Goat Empanadas (8/10): The empanadas were good, but they wouldn't be on my list to get next time. The meat inside the empanadas didn't have the most impressive flavor. <br><br>Price Point/Value: This restaurant encourages shared plates and a majority of the dishes are about $15-$20 each. Some of the bigger meat dishes are around $25. Cocktails are $14. Breads are $5.

I'm slightly confused though, the description on the menu said tuna and black bean poke. Is it duck or is it tuna??? Cos it tasted just like tuna.

It comes with a nice egg on top, which of course means yolk porn. Very rich dish, and I wish it came earlier in the dinner. I would've had more room to eat it!

It came with two different spreads, a buyer and lime olive oil. Both great but liked the yuzu butter the best. Our first round we ordered the goat empanadas, the duck tongue, and the dear drives scallopsWe all agreed that the best was the goat empanadas. The goat was very tender and had so much flavor. The duck tongue was a close second. It definitely was different than I expected, but the flavors were still delicious. Our second round we got the sautéed green beans, the calamari, and the steamed mussels. The green beans were delicious with the fish sauce that they included. We went for two different desserts, the caramel corn and malt balls and the toffee cake with gooseberries. Everyone talks about the malt ball dessert but my table was a fan of the toffee cake.

Chef Stephanie Izard has really put together an amazing restaurant with such an eclectic menu full of bold flavors. It is highly recommended that you get a reservation way in advance or you'll be stuck with a reservation at 10:45pm...if you're lucky. Of course, you can always test your luck by just showing up without a reservation and get seated at the bar or outdoors with a bunch of strangers.

Also, the breads and desserts menus seem to change frequently. <br><br>The dishes here are meant to be shared so bring a few friends so you can order multiple things off the menu. The sweet 'n spicy brioche came with a delicious honey sambal butter and refreshing spring lamby jam. I wish I could have a jar of both the butter and jam to take home. The confit goat belly at $19 was pretty much the definition of small, pretentious food though. While tasty, it came with a small piece of goat belly with bourbon butter, lobster, crab, and fennel. I am not a huge fan of vegetables but the roasted cauliflower was a rockstar. I never knew cauliflower could be so good. The pickled peppers, pine nuts, and mint really added nice flavors to the roasted cauliflower dish. The wood oven roasted pig face was so succulent with the perfect amount of fat. It's a beautiful dish with gorgeous colors. My favorite dish of the night had to be the crisp braised pork shank. The pork was so flavorful and tender. I loved the crispy exterior because it added a lovely crunch. The made-from-scratch naan bread that it came with was the best! So warm. So soft. I could have munched on it all night.<br><br>For dessert, I opted for the donettes. Not the best choice on my part. It came with two donettes and a small scoop of ice cream. I wish it came with an extra scoop because it really balanced out the warm donette well. The entire dessert was topped off with a bleu cheese caramel that was a bit too strong for my taste. Regular caramel would have sufficed but it wouldn't have been a creative dish if it didn't have that cheesy caramel, right?<br><br>Service was amazing. Our waitress was a gem. We came around 9:00pm and got seated at a large outdoor picnic-esque table with multiple strangers so she had to deal with all of us PLUS having to deal with us moving indoors due to the unexpected rain.

My favorite were the Shishito Peppers and the Olive bowl (idk what they marinate those in but it's incredible) - The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the lack of vegetarian/vegan options and the price. Especially when you're dealing with small plates I feel like it would be so easy to add another option or two that a vegan/vegetarian could opt for. In addition, these small plates were priceyyyy.

It was very grapefruity and went down smooth.<br><br>Girl and the Goat is a restaurant that has small plates. Wait staff recommended that we get 4 or 5 plates to share to start, so that's what we did. The first one to come out was the duck tongues, which were served with piri piri on top of an ahi blackbean poke with crispy wontons on top. This was easily my favorite plate of the night. The tongues are fried and crispy, with a nice salt. They're something that I could eat all day long (never thought I'd say that about tongues but here we are!). The poke underneath it was beautiful. Everything was clean and fresh, and the spice from the sauce balanced the ahi, and with the crisp of the wontons and tongues? Perfection. <br><br>After that, we moved on to escargot ravioli, served with a bacon tamarind sauce, escarole, celery, and topped with crispy onions. The plating was gorgeous. The sauce was pretty thin, and there was a lot of it, to the point it seemed more like a broth. It was good though, with thick cubes of bacon. The ravioli was perfectly cooked, but the escargot fell a bit flat. I wouldn't have been able to tell you that's what's in there, if I didn't already know. But, it was a tasty dish nonetheless, and I ate all of them.<br><br>Then we got the sautéed green beans, my sister's favorite dish. They're prepared in a fish sauce vinaigrette with onion and cashews. I thought my sister was weird for insisting we get these, because, all this food to pick from and you pick green beans? But, I get it. They were perfectly cooked, with the right amount of snap. They were salty and seasoned and the cashews gave nice crunch. Also, you get a LOT of them, it's a very generous portion for small plates. We took the rest home.<br><br>Moving on, we then received the one, the only famous Girl and the Goat wood oven roasted pig face. (Cue the Homer Simpson drooling). It was outstanding. It's served with a sunny side up egg, red wine-maple, and crispy potatoes strings. Oh man, it's like breakfast but grown up for foodies. The sauce had just the right amount of sweetness, the rich yolk from the egg covered everything in a dose of extra-deliciousness. The pig face itself was well seasoned and rich, something similar to pork belly but dare I say better.<br><br>Then we got to the actual goat, confit goat belly to be exact. It's served with a vanilla butter with lobster and crab (Note: menu online says bourbon, but we were told vanilla). I actually didn't care for this at all, and I'm disappointed that our last dish was the least enjoyed, and that the goat (for which the place is name) was the one to disappoint. The goat belly itself was nice, but the vanilla butter sauce that was covering it was not. Vanilla and pork is weird. Vanilla and goat is weird. Vanilla and goat and fish is a mistake. The sauce on its own was fine. The crab was really good. The lobster was overcooked, and on top of that I crunched down on a rather nasty piece of shell. <br><br>But, we ordered dessert, so that makes it better. We shared the caramel corn & malt balls, which consists of vanilla malt gelato, popcorn caramel,  chocolate magic shell, and caramel corn. I thought this was a pretty good way to nod to Chicago (Garrett's and all). The caramel corn was well coated and delicious. The gelato was creamy and rich, as it should be. The caramels were super soft and addicting, and my favorite part of the plate. And then the ice cream was topped with magic shell chocolate topping. I love Iron Chef Izard even more now for using shell (if it ain't broke....). <br><br>Our total was something to the tune of 130$, reasonable for the location and quality.<br><br>Though some things were a bit disappointing here (like the goat belly), the overwhelming positives of everything else about the night outweigh it, and so I give it five stars. I would come back in a heartbeat. Make sure to get a reservation a month out, and don't skip the tongues and face.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Had a spectacular experience here.  Everything from the service to the food was perfect.  Very cool atmosphere!

Honestly, none of the descriptions of the dishes sound all that tasty, but take my word for it, order anything, chances are really high that it will blow your mind.

I could eat several plates of the broccoli on my own. It's got great grilled, smoky flavor, fantastic crispiness from the rice crispy on top, and creaminess from the bleu cheese sauce. Highly recommended!<br><br>Overall, the ambiance is nice, casual, unpretentious, and cosy. The prices are appropriate for the quality of food, and you leave feeling full and exceptional satisfied.

When I was a kid, broccolis used to remind me of trees. On this plate, they really taste like the trees that were used to smoke the broccolis. 24 hours later, the smokey flavour still sits faint on my breath, and strong on my sweet green memories.<br><br>Pork Shank: Yet another staple at Casa Izard. Just know that when the server informs you at the beginning that they will bring out the food from light to heavy, expect this to be the curtain call. Served with flame grilled Indian bread and some kind of chinese hoisin BBQ sauce, and Japanese tasting relish. Shout out to Izard for representing the Asian palette so much. <br><br>Chocolatey chocolate cake: 10/10 for the dessert, 3/10 for taking all the anticipation and guess work out with a name like that. Exactly as described, it's a moister and more intense brownie topped with more chocolate crumbs and shiiiiiitake ice cream (yeah what are we not making ice cream out of these days). <br><br>Caramel malt bombs: Think Garrett's caramelcorn, getting freaky with some vanilla ice cream, while fooling around with some malt fudge.

It is obvious that Stephanie Izard loves to incorporate Asian and Latin American flavors into her dishes. Most of the time I don't like it when dishes at restaurants are 'Asian fusion' or 'Asian inspired.' I often find that these restaurants incorporate Asian flavors in the most superficial way (e.g. teriyaki-flavored something). However, Stephanie does a wonderful job of weaving both of these cultures into her dishes to create something new and delicious. <br><br>The menu features tapas-style dishes that are meant to be shared with the table. It's best to come here with a group so you can try a little bit of everything, because trust me -- you'll want to try everything! Doing this also lowers your bill. I came here with 4 people, got 5 dishes and ended up paying around $30, which is wonderful given the dishes and popularity of this place!<br><br>I liked all the dishes I tried, but here they are listed from super delicious to delicious  -- <br><br>1. Duck Tongue - This dish is a perfect example of Stephanie doing a great job of using both Latin American and Asian flavors. The dish has raw tuna diced into cubes along with beans and tortilla chips. The duck tongue is cut into small pieces then fried and goes oh so well with everything. Overall, the dish does a great job of playing around with different flavors and textures.<br>2. Goat Liver Mousse - The mousse is so smooth and decadent. The bread (or crumpet) that goes with it super addicting. The bread is slightly sweet, chewy and soft. <br>3. Roasted Beets - Super refreshing and a good dish to clean your palate. <br>4. Pig Face - This dish is topped with an egg. The meat is super tender and juicy - can be a little fatty and heavy. <br>5. Goat Confit - The goat meat is super tender here as well; however, it is a little gamey for me.

FYI...we were a group of three. Here's what we ordered and the rating:<br><br>**Mahalo Cocktail- Be warned that cocktails here are strong, but very good. This was the most like a tropical drink and it was very good, but had a spicy kick, so you've been warned...<br><br>My friends are wine and beer drinkers and they were very impressed with both selections. One friend ordered a Blood Orange IPA and she loved it, and the other a cocktail.<br><br>**Sweet & Spicy Brioche- This was the only item that I felt like was okay. I thought the honey butter & jelly would be better.<br><br>**Chickpea Fritters- Very yummy and crispy on the outside and oh so soft and creamy on the inside. I'm not a Vegan, however, this would be a great alternative to anything cheesy.<br><br>**Spring Onion Potato Pierogies- Has a great smoky flavor and my friend who makes homemade pierogies was impressed.<br><br>**Goat Empanadas- These are excellent. One of the favorites of the night. Be aware that the order only comes with 2, but our waiter let us order 3 since we were a group of three. I ordered these last time I went and they were even better than I remembered...<br><br>**Woodfire Glazed Lamb Ribs- Very good, but I thought it would be better. I prefer Greek-style lamb<br><br>**Pork Shank- This is the best thing ever. It's delicious and as long as you eat pork, this is a must have!<br><br>We were still hungry so we each ordered a dessert and shared them evenly.

Originally had a reservation for 11:30 but checked in earlier and they texted us at around 10:40. We walked back and got seated within minutes. They split their menus into vegetables, fish, and meat. On a smaller menu they had their goat dishes. We ordered the raw Kusshi oysters, goat empanadas, pork shank, and pig face (received in this order). <br><br>The raw Kusshi were the only raw oysters. These specific oysters were sweet and come with 4 in an order.  I would definitely order again. The empanadas came next, even more delicious than the oysters. They were very crispy on the outside but didn't have that oily feel to it that I expected. They were topped with blueberries and avocados, which added a light sweet touch to it. The meat with tender and has a blast of flavor. Next, came the pork shank. This was the best of the meal. The shank had been cooked for over 12 hours, which allowed the meat to melt off the bone. It came with some naan and two sauces, buttermilk and kimchi buffalo. Personally I liked the kimchi buffalo sauce more, tangy with a tiny kick. The whole combination was without a doubt perfect. Last, we got the wood oven roasted pig face, which came with a sunny side up egg and some potato stix. Personally, I wasn't a huge fan of this dish but I'm glad I got to try it. The face pieces mainly just felt really fatty, but super soft and flavorful. The potato stix were super crispy and complemented the pig face nicely. <br><br>Service was on point. Our server made excellent suggestions, empanadas and shank, and he even came to tell us that the kitchen was closing in 15 minutes and for us to get any other orders in! I came with just one friend and we weren't able to finish everything, and the bill was a bit high.  I'd say come with a group of friends so you can order and try a bit of everything, and not drop too much.<br><br>***<br>Came back again and had new experience. My friend called in to make a reservation for 9:30, but we got to the area and checked in early and the hostess actually told us her name wasn't on the list. We ended up just putting our name down and waited for maybe about 1.5 hours, which wasn't terrible. The wait gave us time to show our visitor to a couple more spot around the area. Once we checked back in, the hostess told us, she wanted to thank us for waiting so long, and for the possible confusion with the original reservation, by sitting us at the chef's table, which was perfect for three of us. <br><br>Rodrigo was our server and he gave excellent suggestions and explained why he liked them. I told my friends we had to order the shank. We also ordered the broccoli, duck tartare, and the confit goat belly. While all were delicious, I probably wouldn't order the broccoli again. The duck tartare was delcious and was a nice combination with the mushroom and vegetables that it came with. One of my friends absolutely hates raw meat, but says she enjoyed this! The best dish of the night was the confit goat belly. This dish was pretty small but it was an explosion of flavor once you got a bite of it. I'm not a huge fan of lobster or crab, but something about them together made it work. Lastly, we got the caramel corn and malt balls dessert. To be honest, I don't think any of us wanted dessert but Rodrigo suggested it and we have no regrets! The combination of the textures was fascinating. The gelato was so smooth but the popcorn caramel and chocolate brought a slight crunchiness. <br><br>While sitting at the chef's table we were able to talk with a couple of the chefs and hear their suggestions. We talked mostly to Alberto who convinced us to get the confit goat belly. He was very patient answering our questions and enthusiastic about explaining the dishes.. He also told us about the most popular dishes and ones we might want to try the next time we go! LAMB RIBS, I'M COMING FOR YOU NEXT!!!<br><br>Yes to Confit Goat Belly.

Came with 4 for a birthday dinner and we really went all out; ordered 9 dishes and sat with bated breath for it all to come out. The menu is small but focused; there are essentially 5 sections with a few offerings in each one; Breads, Goat, Vegetables, Seafood, Meat. We ordered 2 of everything except 1 vegetable. Every dish had a baseline level of quality that was high; presentation and service were attentive as to be expected. That said if you were to ask me which ones I think were worth it to get on repeat visits I would say much of it was hit or miss. <br><br>Breads: A must if you want to fill up at an affordable price. Each is $5, and they come with very different breads. We had incredibly fluffy biscuits with a delicious whipped butter and savory jam, along with a crispy toasted brioche with salmon cream cheese and a giardinera that paired perfectly together.<br><br>Goat: Had the Goat belly confit and the Goat pate. The goat pate was...interesting. It came with essentially a large cracker and a bunch of incredibly butter and fluffy rillettes. The actual pate itself was very distinctly flavored with goat, and I think required the accompanying pickled ingredients to balance out its fattiness. On it's own I think the pate was an overwhelming flavor. I'm not sure if I would be able to handle it again. As for the goat belly confit, I had mixed opinions. It was topped with lobster and crab in this light and delicate sauce, and all the components individually where great. I'm just didn't really get the combination together; especially since for a dish that was supposed to highlight the goat belly I didn't really get a big feeling that It was the star.<br><br>Veggies: Got the seared broccoli over blue cheese. Actually quite liked this, would be happy eating this again or trying the green beans(which were also recommended and looked good as well)<br><br>Meats: We got the pig face and the Duck Tongue. Both were great; despite having fried components they still maintained much of the juiciness and fullness of fatty components melded together with delicious sauces and softer textures. Some of our favorites for the night<br><br>Seafood: Soft-shell crab and halibut. To preface, both had pretty small portions; the soft shell crab was essentially one crab partitioned into 4-5 parts; the halibut was a small slice which was cooked perfectly, and served on top of a mixed blueberry and fish sauce base. I think the soft-shell crab was phenomenal actually; crispy as expected but the interior was juicier than any I've ever had. It was a small portion but each bite was worth every dollar. The halibut I felt was a bit more ordinary. The blueberry and fish sauce combination tasted alright, but ultimately wsn't a flavor combo that wowed me. And as for the fish itself, it was moist and flaky, though I was looking for some crispy component(I'm looking for skin here), which was absent.<br><br>All in all, I think Girl and Goat is very good, but also a bit overrated. While all the dishes are good, whether or not you will be amazed by certain ones are subject to variability. On the other hand, I was more full than I expected to be. $30 per person got me stuffed, and for high-class tapas, you are not doing bad if you come here for fine dining.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I was visiting Chicago and this was the first time I had a shot at a Michelin Star dining experience near where I was.  You probably need to make a reservation well in advance for a table, but you can walk in and get full service at the bar or lounge.<br><br>The hostess was curt, but friendly enough considering they were busy and I didn't have a reservation at 5:30 on a Thursday.

Leaving with a full belly of disappointment, I really think this place was overrated. The pricing and portion can definitely be improved.<br><br>I rushed here at 5pm as a walk-in, and got seated immediately. Inside the restaurant was pretty noisy, so we chose to sit at the patio. We quickly checked Yelp to make sure we don't miss out on signature dishes, and orderd the followings:<br>+ kohlrabi salad: the only thing that was outstanding. The dressing was on the heavy side, but the subtle hint of blue cheese worked wonder with thinly sliced kohlrabi.<br>+ sweet brioche: it started to go down hill from here.  It came with some green butter which had no taste, and caramelized onion.  The bread had a disappointing texture, and the slightly sweet taste just didn't go well with the really savory menu. <br>+ goat empanadas: a good dish, but not like, mind-blowingly good, for a place that literally has the word 'goat' in its name. I think it's tough to make good empanadas because the fried corn taste can easily overpower the filling, and they didn't deliver a good empanada here.  The mushroom plated on the side was actually the star of the dish, and helped balance the heavy corn taste and dry goat meat.<br>+ roasted pig face: ordered this one because it was the most mentioned dish on Yelp review.  Imagine bacon wrap in fat, deep fried and then roasted. It tasted like that.  It's so fat, and there was nothing to balance it. It should have been served with some acidic salad/pickle on the side.<br>+ goat shank: last dish and the heaviest dish.  I now have serious complaint about how G&TG does pricing and portion. It's supposed to be a tapas type of place, so why would you serve that much meat by itself, and priced it at $26? Also, the dishes here are served one by one, going from the lightest to the heaviest, so even if you order a salad to go with the goat shank, they would not be served together (if you didn't know and didn't ask). The portion and price was for an entry, not a small dish to share. Now the the dish itself, have you had roasted pork from chinatown? This dish probably used the same technique that resulted in extremely crispy skin. However, the meat lacked most, and was a pain to eat with Naan bread (which was actually really good).  There was some nice sauce that came with it, but the dish itself was, again, just out of balance.<br><br>I may come back here just for the vegetable dishes.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Wil5Rl1jHNiqLadsxOhPRg/348s.jpg", "caption": "Kohlrabi salad"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BGuE5DL9W6WjiMC820xkIA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Sweet brioche - terrible!"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_vVTPV8FHx23b_UTKMnQYA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Pork shank"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "I was so excited to this place when I was planning for a trip to Chicago.

We ordered goat empanadas, and corn bread as appetizers. The wood oven roasted pig face, crisp braised pork shank, pan roasted halibut, oven roasted sepia, and galbi as main dishes; and wood grilled broccoli, and roasted cauliflower as veggie sides. We also ordered Best of Three, Local <br>75, Ring of Fire and Daiquiri for drinks.<br><br>The goat empanadas:<br>eh, it was okay. I couldn't really taste the goat meat in the empanada.

Nothing special.<br><br>Wood oven roasted pig face: <br>I really like the two eggs on top of the meat. When you smash the eggs onto the meat, the creamy yolk mixed with the tender meat is very tasteful. <br><br>Crisp braised pork shank: <br>the pita bread that came with the dish was sooo good. Grab a chunk of meat, wrap it in a pita bread, put some sauces and kimchi on it and you are ready for some deliciousness.<br><br>Pan Roasted Halibut: <br>Yum!! This was my favorite dish! The halibut was served on a almond butter and covered with mushrooms and white asparagus, served on a bowl. The flavors of all ingredients complemented each other very well. <br><br>Oven Roasted Sepia:<br>This was my second fav! The sepia was chewy yet smooth to bite. The tomato and avocado was added to enhance the chewiness and intensified the flavor.<br><br>Galbi: <br>It was served on top of 4 corns. As a Korean, I approve this galbi.

The crispy empanadas were served on avocado puree and covered in chopped strawberries, feta and mint, served on a wooden paddle. The flavours were absolutely delicious and complex.

The goat meat on the inside was rich and flavourful paired wonderfully with the vinaigrette-coated strawberries, which balanced the flavours with its tartness.<br><br>Following the goat empanadas, the goat liver mousse was next. The goat liver mousse was served with fresh bread soft and crispy bread with assortment of condiments such as fruit relish, pickled watermelon rinds, and pickles. The bread was so tasty, I would just eat it by itself but paired with the goat liver mousse was super decadent.

The dish was really rich and heavy, personally speaking I felt like the overeasy egg served on top did nothing for the dish other than presentation.

Our server, Jurson, was awesome. He gave us recommendations and checked up on us periodically, and told us to get ~2 dishes per person.

It comes with tomato jam and avocado butter. <br><br>Sweet corn pierogies -  came with a grape melon relish that went well with the pierogi, which was pan-fried, sweet, and crumbly. <br><br>Wood-fired oysters - tasty, but not the freshest oysters<br><br>Crab Rangoons - one of the best dishes. Perfectly fried and flaky exterior with delicious crab inside <br><br>Braised beef tongue - Beef tongue was cooked just right, tossed in a salad of sorts. <br><br>Wood oven roasted pig face - looked great, tasted a bit too fatty for me, but still good<br><br>Goat confit - also too heavy for my palate. Comes with lobster and crab and A LOT of melted butter. <br><br>TLDR: For the price and quality, this place is definitely worth it (bill came out to around $140 for 4 people). Food was great.

Everything sounded so wonderful that we did have a hard time picking just a few. <br><br>Warm marinated olives - a wonderful mix of many varieties of thick, meaty olives with sliced garlic and mustard seeds. Just the right starter.<br><br>Chickpea Fritters - what a little bit of heaven! I am not exaggerating when I say that I will think of this dish often for the rest of my life. It was perfectly balanced with the whipped feta, crunchy chickpeas, nectarine slices and heirloom tomatoes on the side. A treat for vegetarians and carnivores alike!<br><br>Wood grilled broccoli - this was very different but I couldn't stop eating it! The smell was incredible! The crispies were my least favorite part of the dish - they appeared to be Rice Krispy cereal and didn't add much to the dish. <br><br>Pan fried shishito peppers - this was my least favorite of the dishes we ordered, but it was also probably because the first two peppers I picked were the hot ones. I didn't notice the miso taste at all, though the Parmesan and sesame seeds were caked on the outsides of the peppers.<br><br>Sweet potato pierogis - these were a little treat! Fluffy filling in a light dough with avocado creme and tasty accompaniments. Solid dish.<br><br>Peanut Butter and Jellywich - well, this was very interesting! We'd planned to stop somewhere else for dessert but after the dessert menu was dropped at the table, we were so intrigued that we gave it a whirl. Wow, was it zippy! The sponge cake and Concord grape sauce (that had almost a spicy, tingly aftertaste!) with crunchy peanut brittle, brown butter bread ice cream and torched peanut butter marshmallow. Yum!<br><br>Service by Owen was top-notch! As we'd both traveled in that day, we were exhausted and opted not to order alcohol. He never made us feel bad or cheap for choosing just to drink water. He also had a lot of enthusiasm, steered us in the right direction with some of the dishes and made small talk in between.

It's all about going hard for the meat, with these 2 standouts in particular:<br><br>WOOD OVEN ROASTED PIG FACE - there are 2 ways to show how much you're truly enjoying food: by taking your time, slowly cherishing each bite like you never want it to end, or by devouring it. Ok, I've heard that moaning is a 3rd way, but that's not something I'll ever do. In this case, we mixed the egg yolk in with the potato six, cilantro, tamarind, and red-wine maple like the server suggested, then finished it off almost as quickly as I change the radio station when a Meghan Trainor song comes on. It had really excellent flavors all around, included a healthy dose of fat (which may not be so healthy), and packed a nice crunch, but I wouldn't have minded if it had more pig in it.<br><br>CRISP BRAISED PORK SHANK - it may not look huge in the pics, but this is a force to be reckoned with. This is so filling that I don't know if you could down it quickly even if you tried, so we meticulously carved it up, despite the fact it easily falls right off the bone if you want it to.

Layer on honey sambal butter, and the richness coats your whole mouth. Add in the acidic kick of the relish, for a perfectly balanced, rich bite. Buttery, flakey, heaven.<br><br>Dish 2: escargot ravioli - bacon . tamarind-miso sauce<br>The escargot is tender, fork tender. You cut through the rotund middle of the ravioli easily, and ingest the savory pasta. Not a hint of rubber.<br><br>Dish 3: roasted cauliflower - pickled peppers . pine nuts . mint<br>This tasted like pad kee mao. The smartest application of Thai flavors I've ever seen. The cauliflower at the perfect doneness, sliced flat and fried with amazing mint and spice.<br><br>Dish 4: goat empanadas - huacatay . grilled mushroom giardiniera . queso fresco<br>The pickles were a bit overpowering, but perfect when combined with the flaky empanada shell. The goat meat - shredded inside, is moist and flavorful.<br><br>Dish 5: sautéed green beans - fish sauce vinaigrette . cashews<br>Addicting, said the waiter. Crisp tender green beans in a salty, creamy fish sauce.<br><br>Dish 6: seared diver scallops - ginger-chili aioli . shiitake . sea beans . braised peanuts<br>Plump, tender scallops. Carrying on the Thai/Vietnamese influence of garnishes of nuts with a peanut butter based sauce.<br><br>Dish 7: roasted duck breast - silver needle noodles . rapini .shrimp-duck jus<br>This was the only one that fell a little short of the others. Definitely good - just not much duck flavor and kind of bland. Definitely an opportunity to play on peking duck flavors, though no other dish has had expected flavor profiles.<br><br>Dish 8: wood oven roasted pig face - sunny side egg. tamarind. cilantro . red wine-maple. potato stix<br>Mix it all up and get essence of pork in a soft forkful. Not even sure what i was eating - the collagen melted like fat in your mouth - but charred and delicious.<br><br>Desserts: Because everything else was amazing.<br>miso-butterscotch budino<br>bacon toffee. glazed pineapple. candied cashews<br><br>plantain cake<br>cream cheese-chocolate chip gelato . passion fruit . left hand milk stout<br><br>Best $64 (incl. tax and tip) I've spent on a meal to date.

We walked in and were immediately greeted and shown to our table. The ambiance was very nice, dimly lit and cozy. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly, also was very helpful with suggestions.<br><br>We decided to split everything, as suggested. We started with cocktails and ordered the Ring of Fire. It was a delicious combination of strength and flavor. We continued to order these throughout our meal.<br><br>First food item were Raw Oysters. We decided on the Raw Kusshi at the suggestion of our waiter and they were great. One of my friends who is only a fan of raw oysters when they are covered with sauce and on a cracker did not even mind. There was so much flavor with these that nothing else was needed.<br><br>Second was the Calamari Bruschetta. This was an amazing dish that I barely got a picture of since we went to town on it as soon as it hit the table. The calamari was cooked to perfection with a nice balance of chewy and melt-in-your-mouth. The apples added a nice touch of flavor and the bread was delicious.<br><br>Third we had the Escargot Ravioli in bacon broth. This was also a killer dish that was devoured quickly. The bacon broth really made the dish and incorporated so much flavor and the crispy onions on top were delicious.<br><br>Fourth we had the Sauteed Green Beans. These were delicious but probably my least favorite dish. Don't get me wrong this was fantastic, every other item was just amazing that this had to be picked last. The sauce and onions were great on top and definitely not too overwhelming.<br><br>Fifth we devoured the Goat Empanadas. There is not much I can say about these other than you absolutely have to try this dish. <br><br>Last for our main course was the ever popular Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face. This might sound a little weird but you do not get the actual face of a pig on your plate, it is shredded. This was the perfect way to end the main courses of a perfect meal. <br><br>Finally to round out our whole dinner we had to have dessert. We ordered the PB&J dessert, again at the suggestion of our waiter.

Our group shared the soft blue crab cake which Waze flavorful and a good basic start to the meal. The second dish was Escargot ravioli.

It was a similar to a delicate small piece of pork belly but with a little more flavor. Then came the actual pork belly which was a little tough and thin than I'm used too but that mishap was forgiven quickly when the server brought out the pigs head. Whether or not it actually was the head of a pig; it had a fantastic flavor and we were back in course. We closed our meal with wood fired lamb ribs.

Everything that was served was absolutely delicious! I came here last night for a Team dinner and we had our own private room downstairs. The exterior is lovely with an outdoor dining area and the room where we dined was lovely and rustic. Beautiful setting on a wood table with candles and a plant in the center. <br><br>We met Gary, our go to server for the evening and he was awesome... Really knew the menu well, listened and tended to our dietary needs, and was completely gracious throughout the night. <br><br>I asked if any of the amazing-sounding cocktails could be made without alcohol and so I got The Royal Rubus that way. It was citrusy soda with lemon bitters, blackberry and lime. It came in a brilliant raspberry red and was very tasty and refreshing. <br><br>Started off with an assortment of breads: One sourdough with little pieces of ham in it, which was okay. I didn't have a ton of flavor but I liked the green peas and ham that came with it. There was also muffin top bread, which was nicely moist and it came with yummy seasoned butter. <br><br>Next we had \"Fried Naked Cowboys\" which were fried oysters with egg salad on the bottom. These came in cute little spoons and one bite form. Even though I'm not a huge fan of oysters, it was quite good fried and the sauce on top worked well with it. <br><br>Then there was salad which consisted of fennel, evalon cheese, toasted almonds and blueberries. This was nice and I especially liked the cheese, which was a sweet goat cheese with fruity and nutty finish. It added an additional layer of delightful flavor to the salad. <br><br>The goat empanadas were one of my favorite dishes. It had strawberry, white asparagus with it and smashed avocado underneath. The empanadas were perfectly crispy and the goat meat was so very flavorful and melted in my mouth! <br><br>We also had green garlic pierogis which was decent, but I didn't taste a strong garlic taste. The filling was like mashed potatoes. <br><br>The vegetables we had were cauliflower, broccoli and string beans. The cauliflower dish had pickled peppers, pine nuts and parmesan cheese. It was slightly crispy and had a nice burst of flavor. The broccoli had little crisps and the green beans had yummy cashews! <br><br>The entrees were pasta, fish and pork shank. The pasta was spiral with tons of appetizing beef, which was wonderfully juicy and incredibly savory. There were also little orange tomatoes and tomatoes on top that were fresh and flavorful. We also had wild striped bass in a coconut green curry, new potatoes and artichokes. I enjoyed this dish, especially the slightly charred skin on the fish. Last, was the crisp braised pork shank with naan and the following dipping sauces: Grilled spring onion kimchi and buttermilk dressing. The pork was so wonderful and tender!  I loved the crunchiness of it. <br><br>After all that, there were 5 different types of desserts. My absolute favorite was vanilla gelato with chocolate shell, caramel sauce and caramel popcorn. This dessert was truly delectable and so decadent. I could have a whole bowl of it if I wasn't already so stuffed. My second favorite dessert was balls of coated gelato with peanut butter inside and candied peanuts. There was also a tres leches cake with strawberry and some pudding, as well as fruity sorbet. It was a nice, light and yummy treat. Then there was a pudding-like dessert with a blend of pure toffee pieces, expresso and vanilla. The last dessert was different and interesting. It consisted of gelatin, blueberries and pieces of meringue. <br><br>Each dish from appetizer, to entree, to dessert was well thought out and unique in a good way. All of the food exceeded my expectations and was mouthwateringly delicious! The service was impeccable. Everything came together seamlessly.

The servers are extremely attentive. There was never a time that my glass was empty, or that my server was gone too long. Its these kinds of details that make you want to be a regular at any restaurant.<br><br>The Goat Empanadas: While I was nervous about trying goat, my nerves were instantly diminished by the incredibly balanced and satisfying flavors that were exploding out of this empanada. This crispness of the empanada was truly beautiful. With each bite, I was left with a smoky aftertaste that was mind-blowing. And I honestly could not get enough of the light mayo dressing (i think thats what it was) that was drizzled on top. 9.4 score overall. <br><br>The Calamari Bruschetta: This was extremely disappointing. The calamari itself was cooked perfectly, but the bruschetta as a whole lacked flavor.The bruschetta was topped with a creamy cheese layer that was light and sat between the bread and the calamari. Over the calamari, were apple shavings that gave nice bursts of flavor. This dish was not bad, but compared to everything else that was unbelievable, this did not hold up. 5.5 overall score.<br><br>The Pork Shank: I actually have tears in my eyes thinking about this dish. I miss it. The meat is so creamy and cooked so perfectly, that it truly falls off of the bone. It is accompanied by 2 sauces. One, the red sauce, is a lightly spicy sauce that i practically bathed my meat it to. I would have poured the remaining sauce in my mouth honestly if I wasn't on a date. the second, a buttermilk ranch, was good but too creamy for my personal tastes. A carrot salad also is on the plate, and that too is perfectly light and balanced. I would eat that any day. 9.8 overall score. <br><br>The Pig Face: WOW! First off, don't let the name scare you. To think the my boyfriend and I hesitated ordering this offends me looking back. It was by far one of the more amazing dishes that has ever graced my mouth. The meat has a over easy egg on top, and both practically melt open with the touch of your fork. The egg was the perfect compliment, and i even licked the plate for more when it was over. ( I have no regrets about that) <br><br>Finally the Carmel desert, the restaurant (again being so amazingly attentive) knew it was an anniversary and brought us out a caramel popcorn ice-cream dessert.

That's exactly what I did. I called the restaurant at 430pm on a sunday to ask about seating and reservations. The lady told me that they were completely booked but i can still walk in and sit at the bar for dinner. The earlier i go there, the shorter the wait time. My BF and I arrived there around 545pm and were immediately seated out on their patio. They still had open seats at the bar but I picked to be outside since the weather was gorgeous. Keep in mind that the patio tables are made up of large picnic type tables so you will be sitting next to strangers and listening to their conversations.<br><br>For 2 people, they recommended ordering 4-5plates to share.<br><br>In order from most favorite to least favorite:<br><br>-Wood fired oysters-OMG, they are amazing! The slight cooking probably brings out a stronger taste in the oysters and it was soooo delicious. The oysters were fresh, succulent and creamy and one of the best things I ate that night. Definitely ties for 1st place with the pork face as most memorable dish. MUST GET THEM! <br><br>-porkface- I loved it. Don't recall trying pork face before but the meat has a nice texture and it's also fatty so it was tastyyyy....kinda like porkbelly, but slightly different. I definitely recommend trying this dish if you wanna try something different/slightly exotic yet tasty.<br><br>-bucatini- yummy! Mixed with milk braised pork shoulder and tomatoes. It tasted somewhat like penne vodka, but it's bucatini. I've never had bucatini before and found it interesting that the middle of the noodle is hollow. Everytime I slurp up the pasta I can hear it because of the air going through the bucatini. This is probably my 3rd favorite dish that night.<br><br>-Hamachi Crudo- it was good but not amazing or unforgettable. There's probably better things on the menu I could've tried.<br><br>-goat empanadas- I didn't originally want to get this but since I was at \"girl and the GOAT\", I figured I needed to try some goat, and alot of yelpers seemed to like this dish. It tasted good and had interesting flavors with the avocado and the strawberries. The goat meat in the empanadas reminded me of pulled pork but with a more gamey taste, but not as strong as lamb. If you wanna try something goat, I'd probably try a different dish. This one was good but wasn't particularly memorable to me. I wish I ordered my original first choice of the grilled octopus instead. I guess this gives me a reason to go back to chicago.<br><br>For dessert, the waiter recommended the caramel popcorn with ice cream.dont remember the official name on the menu but it was good.

We came shortly after 6PM and the wait was already over two hours, but fortunately, we were also given the option of sitting outdoors, for which there was immediate availability. We got lucky, because one of my friends had to go in for her night shift at 9PM, so we wouldn't have been able to wait two hours.<br><br>Though I didn't sit inside, I did get a peek of the interior, and it's quite a large space, with lots of tables and a lounging area with couches. I also went to use the restroom, which was downstairs. I will say that the light at the stairwell is not very bright and I had difficulty seeing the steps, so I feel like this could be improved for safety considerations. I also found it amusing that the restrooms below are individual rooms (probably at least six separate doors) with no gender designation; I've never seen that before!<br><br>Our waitress was great. She wasn't overtly friendly, but was very attentive. Our dishes were served by many different people, but each time, they always announced the name of the dish and the primary ingredients, which I think added a nice touch of class. Our waters were also regularly topped off.<br><br>Since we were a party of three, it was recommended that we order six plates for sharing, so that's exactly what we did (plus one dessert). I can't remember all the names of the dishes now, but see my photos and their corresponding captions. There is a separate menu of \"goat dishes,\" and the goat liver mousse that we opted for was fantastic! It came with lots of warm biscuits and several sauces/garnishes. All of our other dishes were amazing too. <br><br>The presentation of each dish was also very thoughtful. The quality of the ingredients was apparent when you tasted each dish, and while the portions were not large, the three of us were still full at the end of the meal.<br><br>Although pricey, our meal after splitting three-ways was only about $40 per person, which was reasonable.

The tongues were crispy and I could have eaten them without anything else. The pig face was the favorite of the table with porky goodness mixed with unctuous egg yolk. <br><br>The pierogis were ok but at $16 for the dish definitely not worth it as the fried dough tasted more like an empanada filled with cheese with not much ramp flavor. <br><br>The octopus was tender and had a lovely grilled flavor but I felt the sauce might have been a little heavy handed and masked the dish a bit. The worst dish was the ham frites which our waiter vaguely warned us about by saying they were fries basically. My husband still went ahead though. The fries themselves were very good but there was a dusting of ham salt as it was explained to us that tasted like ground up bacon bits.

The beef tongue was great. It was so tender and flavorful. The menu said it was served with a \"salsa verde,\" but I thought it was more similar to a pesto. Either way, it was still great. The cuttle fish was amazing! It had great flavor. The fish was mostly potatoes with a few pieces of cuttle fish, but I loved the combo of the pistachio and Dijon. So delicious! The goat belly was served with bits of lobster. I actually really liked the goat belly itself. It was tender, but I was pretty underwhelmed by the fish itself. Our waitress said their green beans were really popular, so we decided to give them a try. I was really not a fan. The fish sauce was overpowering and way too salty. I told the waitress I wasn't a fan, and they brought us the broccoli! It was such a nice gesture, but we were unimpressed by the dish :/. <br><br>Service: the service was outstanding!! Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and very accommodating. We also really appreciated them bringing out another veggie dish after I made a comment about not loving the green beans. <br><br>Ambience: it's a big space, but still very cozy.

It was served with a mignonette sauce, and the oysters themselves were tiny but packed with flavor!! <br><br>Goat carpaccio - got to order goat here, right? Thinly sliced raw goat served with thin fried parsnips, vinaigrette, and frise. Very nice. <br><br>Duck tongue - We ordered this last minute actually, and this actually ended up being my favorite dish of the night (over the pig face). Don't let the protein freak you out -- it was a piece of deliciously fried and well seasoned duck tongue (it just tastes like regular duck and isn't really any textual differences). Try this!! <br><br>Pig face - Overrated. A runny egg covers a compressed patty of pig face parts with some potato sticks. I didn't think this was particularly interesting. Just a standard old-fashioned egg and meaty goodness. It's basically like pork belly. <br><br>Pork shank - This was a peculiar dish. It was good but not sure what the vision was. It was a beautifully fried pork shank served with homemade naan (done really well), buttermilk ranch, hot sauce, and kimchi. It wasn't really conducive to being eaten together (naan was cut in small pita-like triangles and didn't open, so not much to stuff?) <br><br>Chili crab - I think this is supposed to be Singapore chili crab inspired, but I didn't get any heat at all. It was a fairly sour sauce, and the crab rice just tasted insanely sour and tart. When mixed with the strawberries, rice, and soft shell crab, it was okay. <br><br>All the leches - Wonderful end to the meal. Two small pieces of tres leches cake served with a rhubarb sorbet.

Between the three of us, we ordered four items: Kusshi Oysters ($12), Confit Goat ($19), Baby Octopus ($16), and finally the ever elusive Pig Face ($19).<br><br>The oysters came in four and definitely packed a punch. Be careful to not swallow too much of the tangy sauce at the bottom of the shell. I definitely enjoyed these bad boys. Afterwards, our Pig Face came in- tender pork bits laid over by a sunny side egg. The meat was impeccable, full of flavor, and absolutely delicious. Our order of baby octopus came next and was also very nice, although I prefer mine to be a bit more on the chargrilled side. Lastly, the confit goat came after we had finished the first three, and the bourbon extract made this taste like dessert!

This was the restaurant we most wanted to visit on our trip to Chicago (big Top Chef/Stephanie fans) and we definitely weren't disappointed. We enjoyed everything we ate (well, almost everything) and would come back. <br><br>But there was nothing about my meal here that had an addictive property; nothing really resonated with me deeply. There was great depth of flavor in every dish, and the flavor combinations were very tasty. I'd definitely want to come back and try other items, maybe I just didn't order the right thing for me.<br><br>What I liked:<br>+ Pretzel bread with honey mustard/thousand island. Lots of horse radish in the sauces. Very tasty and best when eaten with both sauces together.<br>+ Scallop. Perfectly cooked and seared, great notes of sweetness and tasty sauce.<br>+ Pierogi. Delicious, but had no sweet potato flavor. You could see the orange of the sweet potato, but we didn't taste it at all. Blue cheese overpowered it, I guess. Very good regardless.<br>+ Grilled octopus. This was definitely my favorite dish! My gf could taste the lemon, but I wanted even MORE acid. Octopus was cooked so nicely, with great grilled flavor. This is probably the one thing I would reorder if I came back.<br>+ Cheesecake. Great notes of flavor in this cheesecake, almost burntish. A great finish to the meal.<br><br>Average/not great:<br>- Chickpea fritter. A favorite for most, and my gf seemed to like this one a lot, but it was unmemorable/average for me.<br>- Goat liver mousse. Our least favorite dish, we could barely eat any of it. The crumpets were fluffy and moist, but \"goat\" and \"liver\" just aren't two words that go together for me. Pickled vegetables were nice but didn't lighten up that goaty flavor. This was just a bad order decision on our part.<br>- Blood orange green tea. I mean... it's just tea.<br><br>A solid meal that lived up to the hype for us.

Each bite held something new in store, whether it was the soft grilled baby octopus, crunchy pistachio bits, or smooth flava beans and bean tips.

However it works out tonight as we cleared out one by one quickly... <br><br>Please keep in mind that all 4 of us have the Asian taste buds so this could be a bit biased. Here we go:<br><br>Must have: Pig face- the famous pig face was a very good explaination of Girl and the Goat food-surprising and delicious combination of flavors and textures. The pig face was roasted to very tender mixing with running yolk, potato stick and cilantro sauce to bring the fun combination in the month with soft tasted meat (or fat) and crisp potato sticks. I love it. This dish should be very good for your skin per my mom which is a bonus<br><br>Duck tongue was fried duck tongue with Tuna Poke, crispy wontons and some (pickled or processed) black beans. Again those mixed flavors and textures gave me a different way to think how the stuff should be cooked and put in a dish together. I never thought Tuna Poke would go so well with duck tongue. I came from a city in China which is famous for salted duck and a whole variety of duck dishes. Duck tongue is also a local delicate. This dish was be praised by my folks at the table which means it was awesome.<br><br>Roasted drum fish was Spicy! Not only with the hot peppers and lots of peppercorns. It was roasted perfectly with the brownish crust on the top layer. It looked harmless with the apples slices, sesame seeds and green veggies on the top. Remember to get the yogurt on the buttom. I had a bit cough so didn't get a lot. Have to eat it again. BTW, Halibut was not available due to the season.<br><br>Nice to have : Bread is not free. For $5 per serving, we all liked Miso bread. Olive you was good too.<br>Wood fired oyster was pretty good. Others were thinking those were too fishy. I liked it. <br>Roasted cauliflower were great too with pickled peppers and pine nuts. I love the roasted and crunchy veggies so this is my dish. I guess my mom didn't like the cheese or peppers. <br><br>Might pass next time: Escargot dumplings was good. Maybe I was used to the French style buttery escargot. So when the escarole came out the wraper without any extra flavor or sauce, I was a bit disppointed. Plus I'm not a fan of onions. <br><br>We got the pinot noir with our meal which was great. I like our waitress who always appeared at the right time.

And I loved how interesting / creative all the food was - everything has a twist of some sort, and yet the food didn't feel too \"fussed over.\"<br><br>We tried:<br><br>Kohlrabi salad (fennel, evalon, toasted almonds, roasted shiitake, apples) - Simple, flavorful and yummy. Came tossed with a white dressing, which I'm usually not a fan of, but this was light and not overwhelming and really complemented the flavors of the salad.<br><br>Goat carpaccio (smoked trout roe, olive-maple vinaigrette) - Sharp acid / vinegar flavor that honestly made it impossible for me to tell that I was eating goat. Smoked trout roe was a nice touch, adding a pop of brininess to the vinegar flavors. <br><br>Roasted cauliflower (pickled peppers, pine nuts, mint) - A favorite of the night. Sounds so simple but was so yummy. The pickled peppers really added a unique flavor dimension to this dish that worked super well. <br><br>Seared diver scallops (toasted miso-brown butter aioli, blood orange, smoked beet, pistachio) - My favorite dish of the night! Perfectly seared scallops and the blood orange was a surprise pairing that I had never had with scallops before and that once again just worked. <br><br>Escargot ravioli (bacon tamarind sauce, escarole & celery, crispy onions) - Sounds very interesting in concept, but in execution, I felt like I could barely taste the escargot wrapped inside, and instead was mostly just eating the pasta wrapper. <br><br>Wood oven roasted pig face (sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine-maple, potato stix) - Don't worry this is not a whole pig's head - more like pulled pork meat mixed with egg. Was told I HAD to get this, but honestly might have been my least favorite dish of the night. It was fine, but too heavy, and not really to my tastes. <br><br>Sticky tasty crunchy toffee yummy cake (sweet potato cake . toffee sauce & crunch . brown butterscotch ice cream . gooseberry) - Even dessert was a hit! The sweet potato cake was moist and delicious and the ice scream was pretty awesome - very distinctly salted, but once again it worked, and it was quickly devoured by my dining companions (though tbh I'm not a fan of butterscotch and found the ice cream a too sweet). <br><br>Also want to give a shout out to the service - possibly some of the best service I've ever encountered.

For instance, I wanted to get a small sample of a glass and she mentioned that the bartender usually doesn't do this (which is odd bc at other restaurants, it's usually not a big deal - even at Duck Duck Goat, they asked us if we wanted to try a sample since we were debating between 2 sparkling wines) Then the waitress asked are you guys going to share 1 glass?

Do you wonder if the stories you hear about making reservations months in advance or waiting for a table for 2 hours are true or false? True story. Plan wisely and book early. <br><br>We started our trip strong by having our first meal here, though a disadvantage to that would be having a hard time finding a restaurant to trump that experience. The interior itself was casual yet glamorous, and because I like to see all the action, I love that they have an open kitchen which can be viewed from the dining room. Service was fantastic. Thanks to our server Kristen for making us feel right at home and for making the progression of our meal flawlessly on point.  <br><br>Almost everything we got was excellent. Almost. The dishes are served tapas style which is best shared like a family. Since there were a total of 4 very hungry people in our party, we pretty much ordered the entire menu. <br><br>The Must Haves:<br><br>GOAT LIVER MOUSSE ($14) served alongside pickle relish and the most amazing crumpets baked in-house. We almost ruined our appetite because of this which I would gladly do so again. <br><br>SEARED DIVER SCALLOPS ($19) cooked supremely well resulting to a perfect buttery jiggle mouth feel. And those Brussels sprouts (wow)...plus textures from the pecans and pomegranate..oh how glorious was this dish! <br><br>PIG FACE ($19) roasted in wood oven with tamarind, cilantro, and red wine maple topped with a sexy sunny side up egg that gushed out yellow after mixing everything together. Loved the bold and beautiful flavors that was reminiscent of a dish back home called \"sisig\" but entirely on a different level. The crunch from the potato stix and crispy parts of the pig face brought another touch of excitement to this plate. <br><br>ROASTED CAULIFLOWER ($12) was served in a heaping portion compared to the rest but I'm not complaining. The combination of pickled peppers, pine nuts, and mint just tied everything together into one addicting healthy phenomenon. <br><br>CRISPY BRAISED PORK SHANK ($26) was fall-off-the-bone tender that one poke of your fork can tear everything apart. This came with grilled spring onion kimchi but it was the naan dipped in the buttermilk dressing that did it for me. Excellent dish! <br><br>The A-Ok's:<br><br>GOAT EMPANADAS ($16) didn't really make the goat shine.

I can only assume that these creations are unique to this fascinating restaurant. The atmosphere was quaint and intimate. <br><br>Our first plate to arrive was the \"It's gouda\" bread with smoked lard butter and romesco. The bread was a rustic loaf that had a crusty and chewy quality with a hint of gouda baked into it. The real star of this plate was the lard butter and romesco. The smoked lard butter had a delightfully cream texture to it which melded well with the sweet and salty smokiness of the romesco. I easily could have made a meal of just this dish and wish I could buy the lard butter for everyday use.<br><br>Following the bread were the chickpea fritters, which were garnished with whipped spiced yogurt, sorrel chutney, and a mango-citrus relish. The fritters had a nice crispy golden brown crust with a velvety filling. The mago-citrus relish had a slight bite to it that added depth to the fritter which, in turn, was expanded by the whipped spiced yogurt. I can't say for sure if the yogurt had a prevalent lemon flavor or if it was the mingling of the relish with the yogurt on the plate that gave it this quality but the combination was delightful.<br><br>Accompanying the fritters were the duck tongues with tuna and black bean poke, crispy wontons, and piri piri. At first, this dish seemed slightly intimidating to our group unsure of what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised when it arrived at the table. The dish had an east Asian inspired taste to it. The texture of the duck tongues were evocative of crispy pork cracklings with a slight give to it. This ended up being one of the favorites and I recommend giving it a try.<br><br>After the duck tongues were the goat empanadas topped with miso-blue cheese aioli and squash-apple slaw. The savory roasted goat was enjoyably different and wrapped in a perfectly crispy pastry crust that wasn't at all flaky and then cooked to golden perfection giving it a wonderful aroma. The miso-blue cheese aioli gave the dish a twang which was then softened by its creaminess and balanced by the sweetness from the squash-apple slaw. I only wish I could have had more of these fantastic little treats. <br><br>Both the red fish and the catfish came to the table at the same time. The red fish was accompanied by Manilla clams in a curry apple broth topped with an herb salad. The dish was very reminiscent of a Thai curry soup. The broth had a very fragrant flavor with a coconut undertone which paired well with the fish which had only a slight flake to it reminding you that it was fish.<br><br>The blackened catfish was served on a bed of dirty rice then topped with goat xo and pickled persimmons. This was my favorite plate of the evening. The flavors were well developed to a point that they would change in waves of bold flavors: first a slight sweetness, then a hint of bitter vinegar and spice, followed by a salty savory that rounded everything off in to a pleasant luxury.<br><br>After the fish, we received the roasted cauliflower with pickled peppers, pine nuts, and mint. I am always amazed by the versatility of cauliflower, it simply seems to go with everything and can transform a dish or stand out on its own. The fact that this dish was delicious came as no surprise especially with the tartness of the pickled peppers. The texture, however, was a truly delightful addition. The cauliflower was roasted to a state of tenderness, the peppers had a slight crunch, and the pine nuts, a slightly bigger crunch, were wonderful little nuggets of treasure scattered throughout the dish.<br><br>Another dish, which was mildly intimidating was the wood oven roasted pig face topped with a sunny side up egg, drizzled with tamarind, cilantro, and red wine-maple, accompanied by potato stix. It is my understanding that this is one of their most popular dishes on the menu. A perfectly cooked egg blanketed the dish to hide the decadent prize that lie beneath a crispy nest like pile of potato stix. The pig face was juicy, fatty, with some bites having a texture that I can only compare to smooth pâté or pork mousse.<br><br>Our final plate of the evening was the confit goat belly in a bourbon butter with lobster and crab and fennel. This dish is the very epitome of decadence. Words elude me when trying to describe the transcendent nature of this dish. The savory goat belly is featured in this dish in the form of a compacted molding of shredded meat with a crispy exterior topped by just enough crab and lobster to avoid stealing the focus from the dish's namesake. The entire dish is then drizzled in the richest bourbon butter sauce possibly conceived. <br><br>The entire meal was decadent and seemingly hedonistic, appealing to all my senses in such a way that it triggered unequivocal elation noticeable to my dining companions. Our bill, consisting of 8 individual dishes, 2 drinks, and coffee and tea for each of us came to $202. With a well earned tip, it came to $65 each.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Probably the most fun I've had dining out, with exceptional food as well.

The best dishes were a goat liver mousse with some magical homemade crumpets and bits of pickled vegetables and rhubarb, and a set of pierogis filled with spring onion. These were flavorful, made excellent use of summer vegetables and pickling, and generally highly recommended. (Honorable mention goes to my tiki-ish cocktail, the \"Mahalo,\" which was not oversweet, in case you were worried about that, as I was.)<br><br>The other dishes, though a little less exciting, were still uniformly very good, sometimes interesting, always hearty and well-seasoned. This is the kind of place you could always take out of town guests and leave them very impressed with what a tasty and fun city Chicago is. (If you could get a reservation, of course, which you probably can't.)<br><br>Still and all, on the food alone, I can't rate this place five stars -- not in a city where it competes with Parachute and Topolobampo and Dove's Luncheonette, not on a *block* where it competes with Au Cheval and Lena Brava. The food at the Girl and the Goat is really good, but it is four stars when graded on the Chicago curve, because the Chicago restaurant scene is an embarrassment of riches.<br><br>And that brings us to the service. Each individual issue may seem minor, but they added up to an atmosphere of inhospitality: 1, They were more than fifteen minutes late in seating us for our reservation (ironic, given how hard the reservations are to get in the first place). 2, There's no place in the entryway to sit while you are kept waiting fifteen minutes for your table -- a minor inconvenience most of the time, a little less minor if one of the two of you is eight months pregnant. (We did eventually snag a stool-like pillow thing in the bar area, but seating was hard to find there too, because of course it is really serving as a second dining room.) 3, Once we did get to the table, we were noticeably, and unpleasantly, rushed. One set of appetizers piled out on top of the others. One entree rushed out, while we were only starting to nibble on the previous one, with an added injunction to eat the new one right away lest it get soggy. Our server then tried to stick us with a dessert menu while both these entrees were still only half-eaten. (We clocked it at less than 55 minutes into our seating that the dessert menu arrived.)<br><br>Now most of this wasn't our server's fault. When we told him to stop rushing us, he did ease off, and did so without being disgruntled or abandoning us entirely, and he twice interjected some helpful pieces of advice into our menu selection. Rather, all of these things seem more like structural issues -- cramming in too many reservations and too many diners, and thus creating pressure to both keep people waiting and flip their tables faster. Given the long-lasting hype for this place, I can understand how things got this way, but the experience lowered a four-star experience to half that.<br><br>I'm glad I can cross it off my list, but a little bit of that is because now I don't have to go back.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Tasty menu and good sized portions.

You'd think they would be more aggressive in ushering us out, but they didn't really rush us.<br><br>The food was also really good, but like some other people said their timing in when they deliver the courses is off. There was a 15 minute gap between when they delivered two of our courses (when we were ready).<br><br>We got the pork shank, pig face, cauliflower, chickpea fritter, goat liver mousse. So many people say the cauliflower is amazingggg, but we thought it was just good. Nothing really stood out from it. The chickpeas was one of my favorite. It's deep fried, and then is wrapped in some yogurt to add moisture, and to add more flavor they sprinkle some mango slices and chutney. Really good. The pig face isn't intimidating since it's not really an entire face, and probably just cheeks. It is quite fatty and crispy, pretty tasty and unique. The goat liver mousse....if you like that kind of spread, you will love this. They give you more than a fair share of spread. The bread that comes with it is amazingggg, think biscuit flavor, but puffier and not as flakey. For those that don't like the liver flavor, they provide additionally sweeter spreads to help lower that flavor. Lastly, the pork shank. Comes off the bone, really crispy skin (think almost Peking duck). The other sauces that come with it don't really compliment it well, but the meat didn't need it.<br><br>Almost forgot about dessert. We got the corn and malt ball one...and it is just ice cream and some popcorn flakes. Good, but not too special imo.

We were lucky enough to sit at the Chef's table and let me tell you, what a fantastic dining experience this was. Not only were we able to eat the delicious food, we also were able to see it being made. And as if working in a busy kitchen was not enough, the chefs still made a point to interact with us and answer any questions we had. If you ever have the opportunity to seat at the chef's table, you SHOULD DO IT!<br><br>Here is what we had (sorry for the long list, we a lot J):<br><br>-   Pan fried shishito pepper (although I am not a fan of shishito pepper, I have to say that these had great flavors and the dish was pretty big, definitely a plate to share, in my opinion).<br>-   Wood grilled broccoli (MY FAVORITE DISH! The broccoli was made to perfection and even had spiced rice crispies. At first when I read that on the menu was not really feeling it but when I tasted it, it was sooo good!)<br>-   Green garlic pierogies (MY SECOND FAVORITE DISH! The smoked tomato-rhubarb relish made the dish for me, as I am used to regular pierogies and this was a nice turn on this dish)<br>-   Escargot ravioli (although I am french, I do not mess with escargots....at all, however, I wish I did because this dish smelled SO good. My boyfriend totally loved them. If I did not know that there were escargots in them, I probably would have eaten them...I did sneak away a little crispy onion!!)<br>-   Braised beef tongue (yea, totally did not even look at that one... but, per my boyfriend, it was cooked to perfection and the salsa verde was a great pairing)<br>-   Sweet onion brioche (this was my least favorite dish, in all honesty. It was good but nothing breathtaking. I thought the smoke salmon cream cheese lacked the smoke salmon flavor and the brioche bread was a bit dry, to my taste)<br>-   Lemon make you happy dessert (this was delicious! I absolutely LOVE lemon pound cake and this was a hit! The almond crunch that came with it create the perfect flavor mixture and the cheesecake sauce was yummy too. The sorrel ice cream was okay to me. I would probably need to try it again as this was a flavor I was not expecting)<br>-   Chocolate pavlova says-a-me (I was not into this dessert at all because I do not like chocolate nor sesame mixed with sweets. My boyfriend thought it was delicious and was a big fan of the sesame whip and black sesame brittle, in particular)<br><br>In conclusion, we were really happy with our meal and our server (so sorry for not remembering her name) was a delight. She made sure to check on us semi-regularly and provided great information on the food, as well. Icing on the cake, Cassie, the sommelier, provided EXCELLENT wine recommendations for which my boyfriend was OVER THE MOON.

If you want to impress a date or have a nice meal with a friend, this is a sure winner. <br><br>-johnny applecheese (5/5): served warm and comes with chili cheddar butter (heaven!) and apple butter. You MUST order at least one of their breads and if you're really smart, order two! They're the cheapest thing on the menu ($5) and quite possibly the most memorable and addictive. <br>-kohlrabi salad (3/5): overall a nice salad with fresh apple slices, but the evalon goat cheese was too overpowering for my liking. If you like the strong taste of blue cheese, this might be right up your alley<br>-hamachi crudo (5/5): light and refreshing, I just wish the portion was larger!<br>-goat empanadas (4/5): comes with 2 smallish empanadas, not a lot of goat meat inside but a good introduction to goat meat. Did not taste gamey at all. <br>-roasted pig face (4.5/5): one of their most popular dishes, definitely must order this! The pig face meat is extremely tender and rich. You mix it with the fried egg and potato sticks. <br>-chocolate cake with shiitake gelato (5/5): this was amazing! the chocolate cake was warm and I didn't really get any strong shiitake taste with the gelato but it was delicious.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UpQ-yp18rFJAYNn5IOublA/348s.jpg", "caption": "Hamachi crudo"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uzAmE8v4NCY_YZcdtNg0dA/168s.jpg", "caption": "johnny applecheese with cheddar butter and apple butter"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PUXdOBrEjK3gipIpjxWtJQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "kohlrabi salad and johnny applecheese"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "What you, ,,zz c bcz bXx.

The most tender bite-through calamari, delicate goat cheese, and perfectly crisp bread. I'll be dreaming about this dish forever. <br>2. Roasted Cauliflower - It was full of flavor. I loved the pine nuts on top. <br>3. Pig Face - This is literally a pig's face. I had no idea what to expect, but it was served with an egg and potato shreds. It tasted a bit like a breakfast hash, but nonetheless very tasty and the meat was so tender. <br><br>I would go back every time I visit Chicago. <br><br>Pro tips:<br>- Go right before 4:30pm (opening time) - a line up will start to form out the door and around the corner before it opens, but you'll for sure get seated.

Next came the cauliflower, which was vibrant and fresh, bursting with flavor! Then came the calamari bruschetta. This was ok, but our least favorite dish of the evening. It was definitely not bad, but it was missing the wow factor that the other dishes had. Finally, we ended with the pork shank. Everything about this dish is perfect.

There was a bit of a hiccup with our reservation (made last minute by a friend who knows people in high places), so the evening started by us feeling a bit like imposters.<br><br>Our server took a while to get to our table, but when he showed up, he was really attentive and fun. We started with the fried oysters with egg salad (stingray something?), and they were freakin' phenomenal: creamy and crispy and salty and perfect. We were told that we needed to try the sautéed green beans, and we're so glad we did because they were heaven in a bowl, and tasted like an umami New Year's Eve party in your mouth. Amazingly, the green beans were our favorite dish of the night.<br><br>The next dish, the vitello tonnato was really confusing in terms of concept. They did a thick-cut tartare on the veal, but served it with the thinnest possible tuna tartare chip, so not the best food-to-mouth delivery system. Plus, the chip couldn't sop up any of the heirloom sauce on the plate, so that mostly went wasted. Maybe put the chips on top as a garnish and include some bread? The roasted cauliflower was good, but nothing special. Our final dish, the confit goat belly, which we were really excited about, was not good at all and the worst dish of the night. The goat itself was tender and delicious, but the whole thing came with the most cloying sauce of what seemed like pure honey and ruined the delicate taste of the accompanying lobster and crab. Bummer.<br><br>What else? The four cocktails we tried were great, and our two favorites were the gin rubus and the best of three with Pimm's. For dessert, we got the cherry bombe, which was perhaps a spin on tartufo. It was delicious, but the ice cream was so cold/hard-set that it was difficult to eat. <br><br>Final thoughts: extraordinary food in an extraordinary space (and worth going to for the green beans alone), but sadly not in the echelon of what we determine to be five stars because of the (above) snafus. We would, however, eagerly recommend Girl & the Goat for anyone wanting a memorable meal in Chicago.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "After many years we finally got in!

We were told that the wait is approx 1.5 hours, as expected, we went to the restroom, came up and saw two spots opened in the sidebar, lounge area. To our surprise, we can actually order food there. Since we didn't want to wait 1.5 hours, we decided to go ahead and have dinner there instead. Score. the full menu was available and we got way too lucky finding a spot there.<br><br>We decided to order four dishes to share. Lets just start by saying that dishes are on the smaller side here, so either have a snack before, or plan to have one after. We ordered the following:<br><br>Hamachi Crude: delicate pieces of hamachi, maybe six?, pork belly bits, and a chili aoili, with super thin bread croutons on top. This dish was visually stunning. Flavor wise, i think it would have been sufficient without the aioli. I felt that it was too heavy for the delicate fish, but a nice supplement to the meal.<br><br>Sauteed green beans: Fish sauce vinaigrette and cashews with green beans, this was super bomb. the flavors were so bold, tangy, sour, and bold. Surprisingly the portion was very large. this was a great dish to start with to cut through the heaviness of some of the other dishes.<br><br>Pig Face: This dish was everything and more, It's their version of steak and eggs/spam and egg whatever you want to call it. I love the complexity of this dish with the multi-facet textures and flavors with ingredients that we all recognize. This is a must order. Make sure you mix everything up to get the full range of flavors. <br><br>Goat belly: we had the goat belly that night, special for the night. It was a nice slab of tender goat belly, surrounded with bits of lobster and fish with a vanilla bourbon olive olive sauce? This was probably my least favorite dish of the night. The flavors just didn't mesh well at all. The sweetness of the sauce, did not compliment the goat belly as I wouldve liked. <br><br>Although this place is super hyped up, it's worth a try. We probably spent about $80 for two people, which isnt too bad (no drinks go).<br><br>i would suggest coming with more people just so you can try more variety of dishes and entrees.<br><br>Parking is hard to find, take the train instead.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zCoXcwJ8F4QXuKVJ50lBzw/348s.jpg", "caption": "Roast string beans with fish sauce vinaigrette"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/miPWs9lwi9tgC0buSSuiRA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Pig face.

The flavored and the tenderness and that egg! You mix it all together with that crispy pieces of potato! Oh my goodness this dish is super amazing!!! That red-wine maple gave it that subtle sweetness, and while I may not taste tamarind I'm sure it gave it that tiny kick of tangibles that balance this savory dish out. Oh man this was good! <br><br>PAN-FRIED SHISHITO PEPPERS - $11<br>Parmesan, Sesame, Miso.<br>They say only one out of a hundreds Shishito peppers is spicy, and when it's spicy, it's REALLY spicy!  In this bowl there were 2 and I got one of them! I should buy a lottery ticket! Actually maybe just. A raffle from some small school charity...heh. Anywho, some of the peppers were red but each of them was covered in the wonderful flavors of Parmesan cheese and miso! This is a pretty greasy appetizer from all the sesame oil but it's fun and full of flavor! It's like playing a roulette game!<br><br>GRILLED BABY OCTOPUS - $17<br>Guanciale, Green Beans, Brussels Leaves, Pistachios, Lemon Vinaigrette.<br>There's a strong lemon vinaigrette flavor to this but it IS seafood.  This dish is fine but not a favorite for me...it definitely tastes healthier then everything else we ordered too!  Oh and the octopus pieces were tender enough :) it wasn't rubbery or anything.<br><br>GOAT SHOULDER - $75<br>My brother-in-law decided to crazy and order this.

My friends are not very adventurous when it comes to food so I figured this would be a good in-between for us, and it was! It was tasty, and I enjoyed the blend of flavors mixed into it. It came with some picked radishes that added a cooling touch to it. <br><br>Calamari Bruschetta: Calamaris were not super chewy and just the right amount of tender. The bruschetta or as I like to call it, the bread part, seemed fried instead of toasted. The texture was just right, and you can tell they put a delicious amount of butter on it. Would recommend!<br><br>Escargot Ravioli: I do enjoy ravioli, and I do enjoy escargot. I enjoy both of these things separately, and I was very curious as how they would be together. The result was satisfying! The raviolis were tightly packed, and the crispy onions that come with it added a good amount of crunch to it. The sauce was tangy and flavored the dish well. <br><br>Roasted Broccoli: YUM. I usually do not order roasted vegetables when I am out, because well, roasted vegetables....LOL, but I was pleasantly surprised here. The broccoli tasted fresh, and it was soft. They had like a kind of rice crispy placed all over it, and there was a kind of blue cheese like sauce to flavor it. I really enjoyed this dish, and it happens to be my second favorite dish here. <br><br>Pork Shank: OKAY the star of the show is here. This was my favorite dish here. The meat slid off the bone very easily, and the meat was soft and tender, but not dry. That's very important to me. It came with a nan that seemed to be cooked with alcohol and picked butternut squash. There were also two house made sauces: buffalo kimchi and ranch. Both sauces were great, but my favorite of the two is the buffalo kimchi. I liked making a wrap with the nan, kimchi buffalo sauce and the pork. It was amazing to me that as the dish got cold, the nan did not harden, but remained soft. This dish reminded me of the peking duck, green onion and hoisin in a steamed bun. Both of these dishes, very comforting to me!<br><br>Service here was excellent. We had a very friendly server, and our water glasses were never empty. They were always filled without asking.

The overpriced food is mediocre, and the service is absolutely horrible. I am beyond disappointed in this place and am confused at how they have maintained such \"high ratings.\" Perhaps because the restaurant is located in the west loop which is an area of people trying too hard to be with up-and-coming trends so the items on the menu matches to the whole \"West Loop\" vibe, however, all I saw was disappointment. The only plus I would give this place is the music and atmosphere. <br><br>I went to this restaurant on a Saturday evening and had a reservation for three people. My friends and I come from LA,  Miami, and NYC so we understand the importance of reviews and thought that such high reviews for this place was worth us giving it a shot. We were wrong.<br><br>When we sat down, we asked the waitress if they served sangria. She responded, \"No, this isn't a Spanish restaurant.\" Her ignorant response from the get-go changed the mood for my friends and I. There are many testaurants who serve sangria and are not \"Spanish.\" It was a simple and fair question we asked. Not only that, but this place serves goat empanadas as well as many other small plates that have a huge Spanish influence on their menu...<br>In addition to the poor service, this place needs to stop promoting the whole concept of \"sharing\" the meals because they aren absurdly small. There is no-where on the menu that markets the small plates as tapas so that is misguiding for someone who is looking to actually enjoy a thorough meal without having to spend $100 plus becusee they have to get 3-4 small plates to make it one full meal. My friends and I who don't normally eat that much ended up ordering 3-4 plates each for ourselves and when we left, we went to another restaurant called Au Cheval which is right across the street to eat our actual dinner. I ordered the blue-point oysters for appetizer and they were bland for oysters that were seasoned and cooked. I ordered the goat liver with bread and that was also bland. Their sauces were not bad but the goat liver had no flavor. I ordered the salmon dinner and that was so small I had to order another plate so I got the half grilled chicken (emphasizing half a chicken) which ended up being chopped into 4 very small pieces. The grilled chicken was good but for a main course meal, the small portions should have been served as an appetizer as the size of the chopped \"half chicken\" are bite sizes. Each time our meals would be served to us, they would put it in the middle of the table and we would tell the staff, \"no this is just for me,\" the staff would still place it in the middle of the table and walk away immedtiately as if they were annoyed with us. I get it--the restaurants \"philosophy\" is \"sharing\" but how in the world can you share a plate that takes one to two bites to finish?! After all of that, my friends and I were still hungry so we asked for our check and left. <br><br>I see this restaurant being \"raved and highly spoken of\" for maybe another year or so but I have a feeling the reviews will go lower as the prices and services doesn't validate for the quality of the food. They need to make this known as a FULL TAPAS restaurant and STOP the whole \"sharing\" of the meals. Our bill for three people  ended up being $250. Unless you have eaten before heading to this place, don't care for the rude service, and are just in the mood to spend a lot of money to listen to music and people watch...otherwise, please, please, avoid this place and go somewhere else.

Working here.<br>2. Becoming a vegetarian.<br>3. Eating here for every meal. <br><br>That's how impressed I was about this place. I don't think it was mainly about the food (even though most of it was amazeballs!), but it was the experience as a whole. It was seriously one of the best dining experiences I've ever had.<br><br>Reservations: <br>I made a reservations a few weeks before my trip, but unfortunately it was Halloween weekend so the times and dates were not the best. I had to stalk OpenTable for any new changes and I still ended up with an early dinner time. Make sure you book early if you want a desired time and day because this place is ALWAYS busy! <br><br>Experience (5 stars):<br>When we got there, they immediately seated us at what they called the \"best seats in the house\". I was a little curious about that when they seated us at a counter right in front of the kitchen staff. I'm thinking to myself \"How are these the best seats?\" Well, they were right. They were and it made our night so much more fun. Special thanks to Chris, Kenny, and Micha (Mika) for being such good dining company/entertainment! They gave us the inside scoop of what to order and hooked us up with some dishes. They were hilarious and so friendly. The staff made it seem like this restaurant was the best place to work in the whole world. Squirting sauce bottles at each other, mocking managers, and just having what seemed like more fun than any patron in the restaurant. <br><br>Food (4 stars):<br>They have ruined vegetables for me and my husband. In my head, how can anybody make vegetables this delicious? To the point where my non-veggie eating husband said that he would eat this in a heartbeat again and again. He even told me that he couldn't go back to eating my vegetables anymore. We ordered the broccoli and cauliflower. Both were perfect cooked. Perfect texture, but the kicker here was the seasoning. The cauliflower had a touch of mint which I thought was genius. It gave it such a refreshing, unique flavor. I would never thought. Our favorite though was the broccoli. Think BBQ broccoli. It really did taste like they put it on a grill with a slab of hot meat. I've never had broccoli this good before. <br><br>Another not-to-miss dish is the pig face. Remember the pig face. You will not be disappointed with the pig face. Think an updated version of corn beef hash. When it comes out, you mix everything thing together (the sauces, runny egg, and pig) and then this dish is complete. Wonderful balance of sweet, savory, and crunch. I would be happy if this was my last meal on earth. <br><br>I had my first experience with escargot, brussel sprouts, and goat here. All good and made me open to more. This is my ranking of the other dishes we ate. <br><br>Escargot dumplings (dumpling dough was extremely well done and soft)<br>Goat empanadas (not out of this world, but not bad)<br>Baby octopus salad (too charred) <br>Ham frites (please don't order this when there are so many other better things on the menu. My husband loves his fries, but this was just basically fries with special dipping sauce)<br><br>When we asked for the bill and decided against dessert, our waiter still decided that we couldn't leave without eating something sweet. He brought us a complimentary chocolate cake covered with ice cream, chocolate sauce, and toffee bits. Now that's what I call service above and beyond the call of duty! Such a great way to end a meal!<br><br>Overall:<br>This is a Chicago must! Don't worry about waiting 2 hours or so. It will be worth it in the end. Stephanie Izard is a monster chef. Her food should not be missed. <br><br>Tip #1: You can order half portions on certain dishes like the vegetables so you can try more dishes. <br><br>Tip #2: It's tapas style so expect to order at least 2 dishes per person.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/q-hUvOJJNFza3-SVfUxoFQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Goat empanadas"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/W0F6V91H0COKtjWxUrj54Q/168s.jpg", "caption": "Ham frites"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "This is a restaurant you hear multiple things about when looking up best places to eat in Chicago. You'll even find that it's really difficult to get a reservation - we made ours months in advance. The service is good, though I almost felt rushed throughout the entire meal like they were trying to turn the table. Cocktails are good, and on par with other cocktail prices in Chicago ($12-$14). We started with the roasted cauliflower, and dang, they are roasted to perfection. That whole dish was very addictive, and it comes served in a small cast iron. The sauce and seasoning was perfect. We also tried the goat empanadas, because we figured we had to get goat something! They are served with a pineapple blueberry salsa, avocado smash and queso fresco. A delicious queso fresco cheese to be exact. These went quickly. The goat isn't overly gamey like I suspected it to be, but a lighter meat that went very well in the empanadas. The waiter said the halibut was one of the more popular choices on the menu, so we decided to try that as well. It is very light, and served with a delicious almond butter sauce. Lastly, we tried the oven roasted pig face, which is another popular item. It comes served with a fried egg on top, and the yolk just melts into everything. This was my favorite plate, by far. The pig face is so incredibly tender and flavorful. I highly recommend ordering it. There are also some smaller crispy potato stix in there, with a delectable wine-maple glaze on top.

It is cooked perfectly, the Parmesan (?) on top is great and if you don't like pine nuts. push them off to the side. <br>Halibut- I love fish- i love my fish plain. So if you like fish you will like this dish because it is so much more than fish.  This fish is not plain. It is crisp on the outside. Perfectly cooked. It comes with an almond butter sauce. so good. <br>Pig Face- I read the review, get the pig face, get the pig face....it was good...I mean I don't have dreams about this dish but it was tasty. I would eat it again <br>Confit Goat Belly- do not get if you don't like lemon. I did not love this dish because it had a hint of lemon it in. <br>Pork Shank- now this is an item to have dreams about.

The toast they used perfectly soaked up all the sauces. The escargot ravioli sounded really interesting and it didn't taste weird as I thought it would. The bacon sauce and crispy onions made is really flavorful! Their pig face is a staple item for brunch. The pig face came when I went to the bathroom. I came back and my boyfriend only left me one bite... So that might answer if it was good or not. That one bite did make me think that it was more appropriate for brunch though but it was still very delicious. It made me interested in what they are like for brunch. <br><br>I can't wait to come back here! This place is a tradition of whenever I come to Chicago!

It is owned by the 1st female Top Chef Winner Stephanie Izard - so my expectations were raised right there. Reservations are really hard to get. I was lucky to land one on a Sunday night at 945pm - nothing earlier and I was looking about 2 months ahead! My GF and I were celebrating a special occasion, so I noted that on the OpenTable reservation.<br><br>We got there on time and got seated 10min after. We were told that we could either be seated immediately or wait 10min for the \"best seat in the house\". We waited and we were mind blown. We were seated right in front of the cooking line! We literally saw the chefs cut, cook, bake, fry, prep, plate, season and complete dishes which was a very unique experience! Definitely a great start to our meal. I also loved how every chef in the line greeted us and had a smile the entire time. One thing that will always stick with me is the girl yelling \"NADAS!\" whenever an Empanada order was ready.<br><br>Roasted Cauliflower - pickled peppers. pine nuts. mint: This was probably the best cauliflower dish I've had and I'm not a fan of cauliflower. Every bite was perfect and flavorful. <br><br>Chickpea Fritter - garam masala yogurt. heirloom tomato. stonefruit. sheep's feta: The best way to describe this dish is fried hummus blocks. The fritters were perfectly fried - very light and not oily - and the inside had a hummus like texture. The tomato gave it the acidic touch it needed to cut into the richness of the fritter. Feta cheese gave it a nice saltiness. I loved this dish.<br><br>Seared Diver Scallops - peaches. sweet onion. plums. pickled corn. mustard greens. uni cream: My least favorite dish of the night. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't as great as the rest. Scallops were cut into small pieces, mixed with some pasta and served to us. They say it was uni cream sauce, but I was not able to taste uni at all.<br><br>Ham Frites - smoked tomato aioli. cheddar beer sauce: Fancy fries. Lol.<br><br>Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face - sunny side egg. tamarind. cilantro. red wine-maple. potato stix: This is a MUST GET dish here. Pig face?! Yes. Pig Face. You don't get the actual pig face. My guess is that they use the pigs face meat to elaborate this complex and delicious dish. The meat was crispy, fatty and tender. It melted in my mouth. The runny egg yolk gave it a creaminess that went well with the dish. Ugh I WANT THIS RIGHT NOW. <br><br>Miso-Butterscotch budino - sesame gelato. sesame whip. glazed pineapple: Dessert on the house. I appreciate the gesture. Who doesn't like free ice cream?! Budino is more like pudding. It was sweet and salty and it went extremely well with the gelato.<br><br>I definitely recommend this place.

Not as much flavor as I would have wanted and I think would have benefited from a sauce more than a pico de gallo.<br><br>-Sugo (3.5/5) - Basically a pork-based sauce smothering bucatini and baby carrots - Sort of a pork spaghetti. Gooseberries sweetened it up a little bit!<br><br>-Breadstick buns (4/5) - tasted like soft breadsticks and went great with the accompanying tomato jam<br><br>Things you HAVE to order:<br>-Wood oven roasted pig face - This is probably the most yelp'd photo for G&TG so chances are you've seen the picture, It's a great piece of pork topped with a sunny side up egg with some cilantro and potato stix. The pork has great flavor and an awesome crunch all the way around the outside skin. So good.<br><br>-Calamari Bruschetta - This was my dark horse for best dish of the night for me. I wasn't sure how much I'd enjoy it with the goat milk ricotta and green tomatoes but holy hell did these things go well together. The calamari mixed with everything in one bite was delicious. Each bite of calamari I had tasted like it had its own personal char on it which I loved.<br><br>-Crisp braised pork shank - Nothing too fancy going on here except a great cook on a pork shank. The skin was so crispy and once you got past that crunch, the meat of the pork was just fell apart. Mixed with the naan and the kimchee(nectarine kimchee while we were there), this was the second best bite I had during the meal.<br><br>-For the star of the night for myself and a couple others in our group... the chili shrimp with  sweet corn esquites. I've had some great corn this summer but this might be the best out of all of them. The shrimp were of course cooked perfectly with a good smokiness to them and then mixing that in a bite with the corn just stole the show.

I went online and read the menu and raised my eyebrows. Dishes like pig face and ham frites are a little scary. I had my plan B meal already prepared. My husband and I made reservations here to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. Plus I was running the next day in the Hot Chocolate Race and did not want to eat too heavily. Now the review-<br><br>Waiting-<br><br>Make reservations! This place is quite popular. It will make your experience even better.<br><br>Atmosphere-<br><br>Casually posh. What that means is no sports tvs. No peanuts on the bar area. Waitstaff does not wear shorts or gym shoes....unless it's Halloween. :-) More about that.<br><br>Dress code-<br><br>I over dressed. Jeans are just fine. Ladies you can get away with ballet flats. Gentleman-you can leave the jacket and tie at home. I did not see anyone in any type of sports jersey so you may not want to get \"THAT\" casual. A golf shirt or office casual with jeans will work for you here. Just to let you know how flexible they are with the dress code-Since it was Halloween weekend one patron was dressed in a slip. Scary because 1) it was a slip and 2) it was pretty nippy so no idea what her costume was supposed to represent.<br><br>Wait staff-<br>It was Halloween. All were dressed pretty creatively. One of the bartenders was dressed as a one of the queens from Alice in Wonderland. No big deal but it was a guy. My favorite though was one of the attentive staff members who was in charge of water. He was dressed as a banana and had the best smile.<br><br>First menu item-<br>Ham Frites. I thought it would be deep fried Paula Deen style ham cut in slivers and breaded. NOPE! Way more creative and delicious. Ham frites are shoe string fries with crisp bits of ham and some amazing seasoning. I could not stop eating them! Beer sauce and tomato aioli also delish as dipping sauces.<br><br>Serving sizes-<br>Before I move on just a word about the serving sizes. Dishes are made to share so don't feel offended when the wait staff recommends ordering 4 items. Girl and Goat is pretty reasonable priced considering their creative menu. Let's move on.<br><br>2nd dish-Pig Face-It's not what you think!  <br>If it was, I would not allow it on the table. As other reviewers have noted, its 's a sunny side egg covering pork loin (?) elevated on a bed of hash brown like potatoes. This dish could almost pass as breakfast. I am not a sunny side egg person so I ate everything underneath. The pork was tender. It's grilled not fried and the potatoes underneath were also good but they will never beat the ham frites. In fact any frites or fries I have in the future will never beat the ham frites.<br><br>3rd dish-Roasted cauliflower-very good. I can't quite rave about it. It comes with pickled peppers. To me it was a smidge too spicy however the platter they were served on was sent back...empty! <br><br>4th dish and my fav-bleu cheese sweet potato Pierogies. <br>Pierogies are a second staple to pizza in Chicago. Remember Mrs. T pierogies anyone anyone? I would have never thought of this combo of food. You get a creamy salt taste of goodness. If you want something soft on the palate and not extra heavy, this dish fits that need. Off the charts delicious. If you need a carb fix but you don't want to do a typical pasta or bread, then get this.<br><br>Dessert-caramel corn and malt balls plus chocolate cake. We did not get two because of being piggish. One was given to us with a candle wishing us a happy anniversary. That was a surprise to us! I enjoyed the chocolate cake very much and definitely like the malt balls. They were accompanied by vanilla malt gelato which took things to a whole different level.<br><br>There is goat served here but we did not try it.

I visited on a Saturday night and as expected, it was crowded and we had to wait a few minutes for our table. We grabbed some drinks at the bar which were good and strong. It is located in the West Loop neighborhood which is the quickly becoming the hip new area of Chicago. If you dine here, make some extra time to explore this neighborhood. <br>For dinner, we were told to order 2-3 dishes each as it is tapas style. We ordered eight dishes for our table of four. I think that was too much as we were all stuffed by the time dinner was over and there was food still left over. I'd recommended 1.5 dishes each as I think we would have been better off without 1-2 of the dishes we ordered. My favorite, favorite, favorite dish was the chickpea fritter. I could have eaten two plates of those. The Grilled Yellow Fin Tuna was also a big hit as well as the oyster. I would suggest skipping out on the Pan Fried Shishito Peppers because they were pretty dry and unappealing as well as the Ham Frites which were pretty much McDonald's fries. Overall, the dishes that were great were unanimously loved and a big hit for our entire table. They were unique and delicious. However, there were some dishes that no one really enjoyed. It was a hit or miss with the food. <br>The service is great- the waitress was friendly, accommodating, and quick. She suggested different items on the menu honestly and based on our preference.

Otherwise, you will be stuck going to eat at a really weird time. If you want to try just coming here without a reservation, the wait is usually pretty long but you may be able to get a seat at the bar earlier. You can still order food at the bar area. If you really want to sit in the dining area, Fulton Market is full of places you can just go grab a drink to wait. I like Maude's for a cocktail while waiting. Or Green Street Smoked Meats for a beer...though you might just end up eating the bbq there.<br><br>Now to the food! I've been here a few times. A couple of times with a party of four and once with a big enough party to justify getting the goat leg. I think we had a party of eight for the goat leg. The goat leg is delicious, and if you have a big enough party - you should try it! It comes with pita bread, and a bunch of different sauces. When we had it, they also gave us sliced hard-boiled egg and I think crispy potato strings. <br><br>I think it's worth it to come here with at least a party of four so you can try many different things. I'll review the things I've tried here because everything looks super delicious - but there are a few really standout dishes.

Everytime I've come, they change the spreads that come with the bread, but they're always really good. The bread is worth getting because it's that awesome freshly baked, soft on the inside, warm amazing type of bread. Definitely recommend. <br><br>I think if you come here and you're a meat eater, you should 100% get the pork shank and the pig face. I know pig face sounds weird, but I think it's the pig cheek meat that they put in there. It comes with pig face meat, sweet maple gastrique, viniagrette, crispy potato sticks and a runny egg. You mix everything up and man, this is seriously one of the best dishes I've ever had. <br><br>The pork shank is another must try. The meat is so tender, and it falls right off the bone. It comes with pita bread and a vegetable I think (squash?). It is so good. The other dishes I've had here are good, but not rave-worthy good. To me, the pig face and the pork shank are the real stand-outs. The broccoli and cauliflower are great options if you want a vegetable - very flavorful and yummy. The diver scallops and escargot dumplings are good too if you want a seafood option. For some reason, we always get the ham frites here because they're a pretty good side to much on. They usually are served early, so if you're hungry you can eat some of those fries before everything else comes.

Our server that night was lovely enough to make up for the initial interaction. Another time, we were celebrating a birthday and the server seemed displeased with the birthday girl's indecisiveness. The bday girl asked the server which dish she liked best, and the server responded with \"it doesn't matter what I like, it matters what you like.\" We also asked her opinion on which bread we should order, and she said \"it's bread; it's warm and buttery.\" My friend dropped one of the three goat empanadas on floor that night and we were too off-put by our server's attitude to mention anything (read: we were now scared of her), but one of the table bussers saw what happened and got us a replacement empanada.

For peak hours, you need a reservation about two months in advance. The food, ambiance, and service were all great. I had heard of the hype and had to experience it for myself. We had a Second City show at 8:00 and the server was incredibly accommodating and helped bring out the dishes quickly. We started with the cranberry bread that came with jam and some other spread. Would not recommend the other spread because it had an awful aftertaste. Next, I got the chickpea fritters, which had the texture of fried goat cheese. Not super memorable. I also opted for the pig's face because it was highly recommended. The egg on top perfectly complimented the rough texture of the pig's face. My favorite dish was the grilled cuttlefish, which came with pistachios. I loved the contrasting grilled taste and the lemon vinaigrette. Overall, the bill was over $80 with tax and tip.

The only problem is that snagging a reservation at a reasonable time is damn near impossible. We ended up booking 2 months in advance and still had to settle for a 9PM Sunday night time slot haha. By the time it was the weekend we were going, I actually completely forgot we even made the reservation.<br><br>All this advanced planning was just building up some massive expectations for the food. But I gotta say that Stephanie Izard and team totally delivered. It was easily one of my favorite meals I've had in Chicago so far. <br><br>For as hot of a restaurant this is, I actually thought the prices were pretty reasonable. Our group ordered a ton of stuff and got to try a little bit of everything, and it was still cheaper than a steak at Gibsons.<br><br>Food: I wasn't about to make 9PM Sunday dinners a habit, so we made it a point to order everything in sight as if there wouldn't be a next time. Luckily we had a big enough group to even try the massive goat leg too. <br><br>Chickpea fritter - A really tasty deep fried ball of hummus basically. Crispy on the outside, and smooth and creamy in the inside.<br><br>Sauteed greeen beans - Even though I generally don't like fish, I ironically love the taste of fish sauce for some reason (probably because of Filipino patis), so I enjoyed the salty vinaigrette in this dish.<br><br>Roasted cauliflower - They must be doing something right if I actually enjoyed eating veggies. Solid side.<br><br>Hamachi crudo - I just saw the words crispy pork belly on the menu and automatically ordered this. I didn't even realize it was a fish dish. I'm not the biggest seafood fan so it was far from my favorite bite.<br><br>Escargot ravioli - You couldve filled those suckers with anything and I still would've eaten it. The pasta was thin and fresh, and that sauce that was coating the ravioli was delicious. I just wish there was more. <br><br>Goat empanada - It pained me to split the empanada into thirds because it was so good. I could've eaten a ton of these. Crunchy and flaky crust with a juicy, meaty filling. <br><br>Ham frites - Eh. They were tasty but nothing more than fries with some sort of ham flavored dust on top. The dipping sauces were pretty money though. <br><br>Pig face - I had really high expectations because everyone I talked to and all the reviews I read were raving so much about it. Again, it was tasty but nothing mind blowing. Maybe I don't appreciate jowl meat as much as I should, but when you mash it all together, it tastes like a regular breakfast dish to me. It was like a gourmet version of bacon, eggs, and hashbrowns. <br><br>Pork shank - THAT ORANGE SAUCE. What is it?? I still have no clue, but I could literally drink it. There was nothing better throughout that entire meal than dipping pieces of naan in whatever sauce that was. The meat on the pork shank was amazing as well. Nicely crisped outside followed by succulent and fatty meat that fell off the bone. Hands down best dish of the night. I'll order this again and again. <br><br>Goat leg - We honestly ordered this mostly for the experience. We had enough people so why the hell not. They brought out a huge board with a big goat leg surrounded by a bunch of different sauces. It also came with some crispy onions and a whole basket of naan. The meat was super tender. In fact, we literally pulled the bone out clean with no effort. Maybe I just like the taste of pork better than goat, but in retrospect I would definitely just order multiple pork shanks next time instead of this. Worth it to try once though.<br><br>Overall, gatg is probably one of my favorite restaurants in the city.

Cashews): This was a little bit on the salty side but the flavors were magical - the savoriness of the fish sauce + the rich cashew + fresh green beans...YES. I also love fish sauce + veggies (RIP Red Medicine). <br><br>*Wood Grilled Broccoli (Rogue Smokey Beu, Spiced Crispies): There's cereal in my broccoli?! YES. The broccoli was so wonderfully smoky from being wood grilled. Again, a little on the salty side but still tasty nonetheless <br><br>*Copper River Sockeye Salmon (Yellow tomato, vanilla bean yogurt, Sungold Salad, Spiced Peanuts): I really enjoyed how fresh this dish was. Beautiful colors with the tomato and cucumbers. Really well cooked Salmon. Why would one order Salmon at Girl & The Goat? When one is too pork'ed about from The Purple Pig. <br><br>*Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face (sunny side egg. tamarind. cilantro. red wine-maple. potato stix): I know this is THE thing to get here, so how come it's so low on my list? In my head, I imagined canto-style BBQ with an ACTUAL Pig's Face but of course, that's not appetizing is it? Haha. <br><br>*Escargot Ravioli (bacon. tamarind-miso sauce): The idea of Escargot freaks me out but figured that this was as good a time as any to try it. The ravioli was a little too mushy for my liking but, the sauce was divine. <br><br>*Goat Empanadas (Smoked Blueberry Tapenade. Avocado): This isn't exactly something I'd eat a lot of BUT I think it's a must try here. I didn't love the whole blueberries but weren't very incorporated in the dish itself.

Amazing dish! The Pig Face was my second favorite. The pig face \"patties\" are cooked in their wood burning oven and topped with a fried egg and served over potato sticks with a red wine-maple gastrique. The pig face was crisp and yet tender.

They may change their mind and go a different direction. You don't want the customers leaving with regrets, do you?

This was a bit odd because there were a couple dishes i wanted to share with my boyfriend, and a couple dishes I wanted to have for the table. When asking the waiter we could just order a couple dishes for smaller groups of people at the table (so that everyone could get the dishes they wanted and wanted to pay for) he was appalled and immediately said \"everything is to share, the menu is designed that way\" well...I get that, but we have a group of TEN.

I like the whole set up. <br><br>Service - Very good. Our server was attentive & food came out at a good pace. <br><br>As for the reservations part - we sat near the front, so I heard a lot of people coming in and some didn't have rezzies.

I thought it was smaller, but when it came out....My eyes were bigger than my stomach. The meat was so good - done just the way I like it. Especially with the sauces & Naan bread. They do include some sort of Mango Kimchi. I don't like fusion Kimchi, so I barely at it, but my friends had it and enjoyed it. I'm drooling just thinking about this dish... YUM. I highly recommend this item, especially if your table wants to do a \"share each dish\" kind of thing!<br><br>Goat Liver Mousse - The bread/mini biscuit came out warm and smelled enticing. The taste of the bread was super good. Imagine a super good piece of bread along with Mousse, Jam, and some sort of Pickled Veggies. AHHH. Melted in my mouth. This dish was pretty big. Definitely shareable. But if one was only wanting this dish and nothing else, go at it. <br><br>Grilled Octopus & Spicy Chili Crab - if you like seafood and you like grilled items. I'd get these. Both dishes had bold and strong flavors and they were given in generous portions. The rice in the Spicy Chili Crab absorbed all the ingredients and was delicious. Grilled Octopus was done perfectly. Some places kind of fail at grilling this usually, but not G&TG! MMMM. <br><br>^ I should note... I rarely eat seafood. So... my taste buds are different. <br><br>Duck Tongues - I kind of thought this tasted like Chicken. I've never had Duck Tongue till now. So... not an expert.

It's quite a large portion too so I would suggest only getting one veggie dish if you want to try all the other meat dishes. <br>Diver scallops (5/5): This was my FAVORITE dish of the night, it was probably hands down the most delicious scallop dish I have ever had in my life...and I love me a good scallop. Something about the sweet nuttiness of the sauce was just out of this world. The scallops were also seared to PERfection. <br>Sea bass (4/5): At first I thought the flavor was just ok, but as I continued to eat I really enjoyed the numbing sensation of the Schezuan peppercorns mixing with the yogurt sauce. <br>Pig face (5/5): Oh man this was so good too. The addition of the crispy potato shreds is a must, since the pig face is so soft it just melts in your mouth when paired with the gooey egg, so the contrast in texture is wonderful. Another stand out dish.<br>Pork shank (4.5/5): I really like this since it's a showstopper. This dish is HUGE so make sure to save some room. The naan is so soft and delicious and the pork shank is braised to fall-off-the-bone perfection. I wasn't a huge fan of the \"kimchi\" that accompanied this dish though.

Located in the west Loop neighborhood a couple miles or so west of Michigan Ave just north of Chicago's Greektown and positioned among a slew of other top notch restaurant destinations along Randolph Street you could easily miss it. The inside of the restaurant is good sized. The lights are dimmed and its fairly dark inside. The noise level is loud here so if you plan on carrying out some good conversation be prepared to yell. Seating includes tables, bar seating, and even couches and arm chairs set up around communal coffee tables for walk ins without reservations. You can see the magic happening in the semi open kitchen from most vantage points of the restaurant.<br><br>Next: the service. Service is pretty top notch here. You are constantly being tended to by very professional and attentive wait staff. They are on the ball and constantly checking on you without being over bearing. All of my food and drink orders came out in very reasonable time and your server will even help you plan out a specific order to receive your food in to have the best taste experience. Don't hesitate to ask your server for a recommendation or any questions that you may have about specific dishes as they seem to be very knowledgeable on the menu.<br><br>Finally and most importantly: the food. You really have got to be adventurous to truly enjoy a meal here in my opinion. The name of the game is try as many little plates as you can off the menu. A lot of their offerings are rather exotic and include choices like duck tongues or goat empanadas for example. Expand your culinary horizons and try something new!

A table next to us even offered us some of theres to which we politely declined, because like the foodies we are, were strategically saving room for several of the highlight dishes. <br><br>We tried everything from the empanadas, wood fired oysters, duck tongue, 2 calamari bruschetta's, and the pig face all of which I would highly suggest anyone to try. When we ordered dessert we opted for the tiramisu, and also received a pb&j dessert complimentary from our server. I wish I remembered his name because he was absolutely phenomenal!

Bread. Oysters. Goats. Veggie. Fish. Meat. Dessert. <br><br>Bread: yo quiero taco bread. Nom mom nom!! A cute little mound of orange-colored possibly tomato bread sliced. Side of cheddar onion dip and pico de gallo. Ate it too fast to realize the taste of the actual bread. The combination of the sides on the bread created a wonderful appetizer. $4<br><br>Oysters: Wood Fired. 4 oysters with some white sauce and cooked over a well... Wood fire! If you're not into the texture of the food, the oyster might not be for you. $12<br><br>Goats: failed to order something from this section. Boo hoo. The items are quite interesting too! <br><br>V:<br>-pan fried shishito peppers. Served in a bowl with melted Parmesan on top and sprinkled sesame seeds and a miso glaze. Peppers are with stems that are easily broken off and filled with edible seeds. A slight hint of spice. Good dish. $9<br>-wood grilled broccoli. A high stack of broccoli on top of the rogue smokey bleu cheese and spiced crispies. In a simple matter this is the fancy adult version of broccoli and cheese. Simple dish. $10<br><br>F: pan roasted halibut with marcona almond butter on top and pieces of white asparagus underneath with a blueberry nuoc cham to cover. Portion was about a 2x2 measurement. Buttery soft and delicious. The almond butter stood out as a complementing flavor. $19<br><br>M: <br>-grilled marinated pork belly. castelfranco (which is a pale yellow-green leafy vegetable) with green sauce and blackberries. These were thin slices of pork that didn't resemble the pork belly and fat that I'm used to. $15<br><br>-sugo. canestri pasta with a meat mixture of beef, pork and lamb with baby carrots and cape gooseberries. An enjoyable wholesome pasta dish. $15<br><br>-wood oven roasted pig face. Soft pieces of pork face with a sunny side egg on top and sprinkled tamarind and cilantro. red wine-maple was decorated along with potato stix. I would say this is a flavorful dish that a meat lover would devour. $18<br><br>-braised beef tongue. Thin slices of beef tongue and a crispy skin-like layers of something matched the tongue. Almost tasted like crispy duck skin. Could have been a rendition of masa (dough flour or the outside of a tamale) beef vinaigrette and salsa verde were mixed within the entree. A favorite dish of the night! $15<br><br>Desserts: beyond full to even enjoy a dessert. <br><br>The one incident that was odd was that the server didn't recognize anything about a special benefit via Lexus. If you show your key fob supposedly you were supposed to receive a nice surprise from the kitchen. However, the server did not know anything about it! Bummer!<br><br>Ending thoughts: I'm glad I experienced unique tastes for one of the most popular restaurants in the city. Great food selection.

It's this brioche (so buttery and good) and the miso butter is so good with it. The kimchi relish was also good, but the miso butter is just so well paired with the brioche. Then we had the escargot dumplings. This was definitely not my favorite. There isn't this great escargot taste and the onions on top weren't crispy. Disappointing. The next dish - the goat loin. The ramp and potato puree - so good with the loin. It wasn't too game-y which I would be afraid of, but it was tender and so good. After, we got the scallops.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either. I mean I just love scallops and it wasn't AHMAZING. It was still good. Our last dish was the pig's face. I know that sounds weird, but it's this lovely breakfast-ish dish that you mix together. SO GOOD. Such a great last item to have together here. <br><br>Service was good, but not amazing.

I booked probably 2 months ahead, and got a time near their dinner opening on Friday night. At around 4:15 (opening time is 4:30), I saw that they already had people lined up outside who were hoping to get seats without having a reservation. It looked like they were successful, so if you don't have a reservation, I recommend you go during non-peak hours for sure. <br><br>The food was awesome. I love how they crafted their menu items to be moderately-sized dishes (for the most part) that you share with the rest of your group. This lets you sample quite a few things on their menu. <br><br>Our waiter told us to not forget the veggies, as their veggie dishes are really excellent. We tried to get the chickpea fritters,  it were told that the tasting of that dish that happened at 4 pm before the restaurant opened pushed the timing of the dish back such that it wouldn't be ready until 9 pm that evening, or perhaps not at all. I thought that was a pretty good move for the restaurant, not wanting to serve a dish that they didn't think was perfect. We ended up getting the roasted cauliflower -- and whoa, I have never been impressed with cauliflower before in my life until that dish came out! <br><br>We heard good things about the wood oven roasted pig face, which ended up being pretty good, although very heavy. I would have liked a little more of the tamarind or perhaps something more citrus-y to cut through the heaviness. Although the dish was not large, I felt very full even just after a few bites. Our waiter came by and mixed the dish up for us when he say they we weren't doing so enough, which was also nice. <br><br>Finally, we got the goat neck, which we were told ahead of time was a large dish so we didn't need to order much more after that. That was definitely a correct statement -- I never though goat necks were that big! But it was a really good part of the goat which I had not tried before. The meat was super tender, and just came right off with your fork. They prepare the near over a multi-day period and it comes out super rich, a little smokey, but not at all dry. The flavor is excellent, and the sauces paired with it are awesome as well. The vegetables on the bottom kind of got lost with the huge goat neck on top of it, and I would have liked a few more veggies in general. We ended up having to take some goat neck back home with us, and we left with several suggestions from our waiter about awesome goat neck leftover dishes. <br><br>Overall, an excellent experience. It seems like their menu changes pretty frequently, because a lot of the dishes mentioned in other posts were not on the menu when we were there. So, it looks like they have good variety in general and do a good job with all of their dishes.

There is wood, brick, beautiful lighting, and interesting decorations. In terms of the look of the place, if you're from San Diego think Craft and Commerce but a larger space and bougie. If you're from Los Angeles think The Stocking Frame + the upscale feel of Perch.<br><br>THE FOOD:<br><br>Wow. Wow. Wow. I am in LOVE with GG's food. It was a group of four (4) of us and we tried a lot of things on the menu. The menu is split into vegetables, fish, meat, bread, oysters, goats, and desserts. The food is tapa-style and our waitress recommended getting a good amount of plates to share.<br><br>Here is the list of what we tried and my thoughts:<br><br>1. Wood Grilled Broccoli: rogue smokey bleu cheese. spiced crispies.<br>Even the non-brocolli eaters at the table could not get enough of this smokey and creamy treat. The broccoli was perfectly cooked - soft but also dense - and what made me smile were the rice crispies. So random but so perfect.<br><br>2. Hamachi Crudo: crisp pork belly. chili aioli. caperberries.<br>Very light and refreshing. The hamachi was topped with crispy flakes, there were small slices of jalapeños and pineapple, and it also came with pieces of juicy pork.<br><br>3. Ham Frites: smoked tomato aioli. cheddar beer sauce.<br>This platter is fries dusted in bacon with the sides of sauce noted above.<br><br>4. Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face: sunny side egg. tamarind. cilantro. red wine-maple. potato stix.<br>The pig face was roasted to perfection. It was semi-fatty and caramelized. The yolk oozed onto the meat and created creaminess. I loved this!<br><br>5. Braised Beef Tongue: masa. beef vinaigrette. salsa verde.<br>GG is very generous with the beef tongue in this dish. They fry the masa into a crispy chip and the rest of the plate is garnish and greens. the beef tongue was very tender.<br><br>6. Goat Empanadas: smoked blueberry tapenade. avocado.<br>I really enjoyed the empanadas because they were the right amount of crispy and dense. The empanadas came atop a bed of mashed avocado and were sprinkled with cheese. The chef throws some soft cherries on top. The cherries are more juicy than sweet.<br><br>7. Confit Goat Belly: bourbon butter. lobster n' crab. fennel.<br>The goat belly reminded me of the Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face (\"PF\") but the PF had a caramelized taste. This dish is a surf and turf option and comes upon a bed of what tasted to me like a smooth mashed potato but I could be wrong. Whatever it was, it was yummy.<br><br>8. Horchata Rice Pudding: rhubarb semifreddo. cinnamon toast crunch.<br>Putting my I'm Mexican -I love horchata - I love arroz con leche - bias aside, I can honestly say this is the BEST dessert I have ever had in my LIFE. Rhubarb? Really? YES! What an odd mix of texture and flavor and what a fabulous explosion of deliciousness in my mouth. This cold horchata ball (semifreddo - semi-frozen dessert) that won't melt sits atop a warm rice pudding. On the side they place the rhubarb, which is crunchy and tart, and then on top of it all goes their homemade cinnamon toast crunch in pieces and two big chips at the top. It was ridiculous!

It was a bit too strong for my liking. <br><br>* Pan Roasted Halibut (marcona almond butter, white asparagus, blueberry nuoc cham) $18 The highlight of the meal (!!!) 10/5<br>- Our server informed us that this was a seasonal item and that Chef Stephanie won the Top Chef competition with this dish. Well obviously we had to order this and I'm so glad that we did. It was soft and buttery and I could not get enough of it. It was my favorite dish of my trip and I tried a lot of memorable items.

While it was robust in flavor, and I enjoyed the first bite, it was a bit too fatty and dense for me to continue eating more spoonfuls of it. Jeff kept putting it on my plate and I just switched plates with him :P <br><br>* Confit goat belly with bourbon butter, lobster n' crab, fennel ($19) 2/5<br>- It would seem unpatriotic to not try goat as it's in it's name-sake So, based on another reviewer's recommendation we tried the goat belly.

So, I've learned over the years that as a single diner, I can almost always find a seat at the bar. My method held true tonight. <br><br>So, the chef, Stephanje Izard (a Top Chef alum, but lots of amazing chefs have never been in a tv competition), focuses on using the whole critter in dishes that walk a fine edge between \"What the Hell!\" and gastronomic Nirvana. A couple years ago I read a piece by an economist about making the most of your dining experiences. He essentially said, pick the thing that sounds the strangest, the thing you would normally eschew. Well, so far, that theory has served me pretty well, as it did tonight. Iota, however, still thinks I may be out of my mind even though she gobbled stuff down as fast as it came out--of course, this was after she screeched a bit. <br><br>We started with yummy brioche buns served with tomato jam and jalapeño butter. Next came the grilled shisito peppers (Iota: Aaaaoootterrrgaaonn? Translates to again? Really?) topped with sesame miso sauce. Completely different experience than at Garces' Mercat a la Planxa. <br><br>Then came the duck tongues. It took a bit of convincing to get Iota to slip one between clamped lips, but once she did, her eyes got big, and she grabbed a couple handfuls, which made the guy sitting next to her comment that he'd never seen a chimp with such and appetite (I suspect he'd never dined with a chimp before). This dish was amazing--really. Perfectly balanced unctuous and crispy and fresh and bright. The crispy fried duck tongues were warm and crunchy on the outside and rich as marrow on the inside. They were layered around a tuna-fermented black bean poké tossed with daikon strips and arugula all set on top of a piri piri sauce and topped with wonton strips. (Now, those of you who can't get past the tongue, you'd likely be all over it if I said it was crisply chicken skin instead of tongue, so get over it.)<br><br>And then we splurged with dessert--and if you wanna know about that, you'll have to go to dinner with me. I'll just say that the salty sesame spymaster on top perfectly balanced the rich sweetness hiding.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tt6Bzj5ZS3RvKU2vhB9j4A/348s.jpg", "caption": "Yummy brioche buns with tomato jam and mild jalapeño butter."}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zgEx4davJ65G-Pzgm8LROQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Shisito peppers go to heaven with a thick coat of miso."}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VSMZ00oq-_r8Vph6SAOtgg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Duck tongues--seriously.

The food fell a little short for me on round two, hence my 4 star review. <br><br>First, the interior is nice, but it is pretty typical of most interiors I think for the current trendy restaurant scene. Dark interior, bar area, high ceilings, open kitchen, some exposed brick. And the bar area is pretty small, but if you can't manage to get a reservation (which yes you should be making 2-3 months in advance if not earlier since this place is seriously always booked....) you could try the bar area at off peak times and see if you can snag some space. <br><br>Menu wise, I love the small plates sharing concept, and the crispy pig face really is that tasty. The flavors are just all there and so balanced, this dish was great. They make their own breads here as well, and I like that each time I had different bread choices. Their roasted beets were pretty tasty and their chickpea fritters as well. The calamari bruschetta in our most recent visit was a great rec from our server, since that clam juice in the bread is pretty awesome. But the goat empanadas fell short for us and the green beans were just like other green beans we've had elsewhere. So like I said, the first visit was amazing. Something during our second visit just didn't quite wow us in the same way. And for having to make reservations so far in advance, I really would expect no off nights here.

The tender, sweet asparagus cuts up the rich flavors like a culinary intermission. This dish was truly an experience! <br><br>The roasted cauliflower went beautifully with the mint and lemon. My \"least favorite\" dish of the night was the goat carpaccio but that itself was fantastic. I'm not much of a goat eater but the meat has a surprisingly mild flavor. Paired with the smoke trout roe and olive slivers, it simultaneously channeled smoked salmon with capers and sashimi at the same time. <br><br>Last but not least were my TWO desserts. I do not normally order dessert. I don't even have much of a sweet tooth, but I thought- why not, let's just have the full course. I was eyeballing the horchata rice pudding with the rhubarb semifreddo but Alex asked me to trust her and gently suggested the toffee cake. Best. dessert. ever. The candied cashews were incredible. The toffee cake was incredible. Everything about this dessert was incredible. Once again, I'm not a dessert person, and I would order this again in a heartbeat. She sent out the rice pudding anyways for me to try, and despite being utterly fantastic as well, the toffee cake is where it's at! <br><br>I am floored by the quality of food and the level of service for the price I paid. Such quality, well-prepared food in such an unpretentious environment, almost unheard of where I am. I just wanted to cry knowing that I live almost 700 miles away from this place. <br><br>I don't like to repeat myself when I travel but honest to goodness, this is not a place you want to skip over if you're dropping into town.

The blueberry nuoc cham added some fruitiness and salty funk, while the mushrooms added some earthiness to the dish. The white asparagus added slight hints of sweetness and more earthiness to the dish.<br><br>The Chili Shrimp ($17) was not hot at all, more of a mild heat. The shrimp were fairly large, and nicely cooked. They were still sweet and tender, and not beaten to death with heat. It was paired nicely with the sweetness from the corn.<br><br>Grilled Walter's Chicken ($21) was sort of a surprising dish in that is was somewhat soup like. The chicken was fall off the bone tender, with hints of Asian flavors due to the five spice. The fingerling potatoes were nice and creamy.<br><br>The Braised Beef Tongue ($15) was very tender and \"meaty\". The masa was kind of surprising since it was in chip form, but added a nice textural contrast.<br><br>The Miso Butterscotch Budino was silky smooth with some saltiness from the miso. The black sesame seeds added a textural contrast and more earthiness to the dish. A very satisfying way to end the meal.<br><br>The food here is excellent with execution also being on point.

First, it was packed because of the restaurant week( no space to walk around when I got in ) I saw people were waiting to get in even the host said there weren't be able to take any reservations till after 11pm Second, the place is so much bigger than what I thought and well put together.

I made another  reservation ( my plan B) at 10pm at another hot spots right across the street that starts with B and ends with an A but after I saw Girl & The Goat, I called the other place and cancelled. My friends and I spent the whole night there and had an amazing time.<br><br>One of the bartenders, Jason made excellent drinks for our group. I stick with 2 of my favorite drinks, Local 75 & Best of Three, seriously amazing! My friends ordered almost everything on their cocktail list just to try out and they really enjoyed everything.<br><br>We ordered small plates to share and I was focusing on cocktails ;) All dishes looked great  with a nice presentation.

While the hamachi has interesting combination: hamachi sashimi with the sealed port belly, I feel the port belly has too strong flavor so the fish taste a bit bland. I really love the goat belly dish. The fatty goat belly comes with very refreshing sauce , and with crab and lobster. That combination is super ... very balanced taste ! <br>Funny thing is , after 2 dish I don't feel super full , and they even offer small portion of desserts, how considerate! I had the donut with ice cream and fig sauce. Again very nice combination. The warm and crunch donut combined with the creamy cold ice cream!

Note if we didn't find a seat at the bar, it meant a 1 hour wait (we arrived ~6p). Overall the food is inventive, flavorful, and well executed. I would definitely return again. This is what we ordered:<br><br>Miso Hungry = If a croissant had a baby with a brioche and somehow formed itself like a cheesy popover, you could almost get to the Miso Hungry Bread. It was buttery, warm and delicious. I would buy this in a bakery if I could. The bread is served with a miso butter and kimchi relish.<br><br>Kohlrabi Salad = Sort of a less memorable, filler dish. My friend wanted salad so I said sure. It was well dressed and fresh but hardly something I'd order again. I will give credit though for the addition of blueberries which was a fun twist.<br><br>Goat Belly and Lobster = Imagine tender braised goat with the indulgent bit of fat like what you would get with pork belly. Then imagine it's sitting alongside poached lobster. This is like an odd spin on surf and turf but right in every other way. The sauce was rich and buttery with hints of vanilla. Delicious and unique. <br><br>Pork Shank = If you're here and you can only eat one dish. I'd get the pork shank. It's a meal in itself (you could probably do fine just ordering 2 other dishes along with this one). It's an enormous braised, tender, falling-apart pork shank served with all the fixings like house-made flat bread, sauces, and grilled vegetables.

I'm a huge fan of Top Chef and to have been able to go to Chef Izard's restaurant, it was just the perfect birthday dinner. It wasn't until we got there, did we realize it was served tapas style, small portions of each order. We took advantage of that and ordered practically one dish off each section of the menu. <br><br>1. We started with the Herbs of Feta. Fresh bread with hummus and feta oil dip, what a great combination! You can taste the herbs on the bread, and the crunch on the crust of the bread was delicious. I couldn't get enough of the hummus, almost spooned it all onto my plate. <br><br>2. Now, I'm not a huge fan of oysters, especially raw but why not just try it in a different way? Fried, you say? Yum, yum! Fried Naked Cowboys was recommended by our waiter and wow! He wasn't wrong. A spoonful of bite sized oysters with egg salad on top, it was just marvelous. Who doesn't liked fried stuff? I would definitely want this again. <br><br>3. Favorite dish of the night, Chickpea Fritter! Love the crispy outer layer and then when you bite into it, you get a soft filling of chickpea in the inside. Love the bite with all the other garnishes and vegetables in this dish. Beyond amazing. <br><br>4. So other seafood options were pretty typical choices, so we decided to try something new, Pan Roasted Monkfish. It had a great sear to it. Wasn't my favorite, but nonetheless, still really good. <br><br>5. Seem like the Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face was a favorite by many reviewers, so it was a must try. As soon as it came out, you could smell the meat. It was topped off with a sunny side egg. There was a mix of fatty parts and tender meat. Make sure to break the yolk on top of the meat so it spreads around the meat, definitely was a good way to eat it!<br><br>6. At this point, my sister and I already had a loadful, but that didn't stop us from finishing the rest of our order, which was the Confit Goat Belly. The goat was oh so savory, but it was the lobster and crab with the bourbon butter that made the dish. The perfect representation of a surf and turf. <br><br>All the flavors in my mouth was craving for something light and sweet by the end of it, so we ended with a fruity dessert. <br><br>7. The Citrus Pavlova, yum yum! Ice cream served with a mix of blood orange, yuzu curd, kumquats, and a vanilla meringue. I couldn't get enough of this. It was absolutely scrumptious.

I really liked the touch of bean sprouts and the full chickpeas. Overall, the flavors and textures in the dishes were well thought out and paired. <br><br>My favorite was dessert. The budino was similar to a bread pudding with many more textures. In each bite you had spongy cake, glazed pineapple, creamy pudding, crunchy toffee pieces and finally some fresh cream.

I didn't really notice the miso taste anywhere, but the dish was fabulous. <br><br>While we didn't have anything to complain about with our food, our server did offer complimentary dishes to the tables next to us.

The radish and sourness of this dish perfectly balanced the heaviness from the short ribs.<br><br>3. Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face (4/5)<br>Sunny side egg. Tamarind. Cilantro. Red wine-maple. Potato six<br>The meat was crispy and dotted with pieces of fat. I really like the flavor of the pig face and how they tried to lighten it with the egg. This dish is like a hidden treasure, you'll have to unmask the egg to see what's underneath. Interesting plating. The combination of green and brown sauce made me lose my appetite for this dish. Really enjoyed the potato stix that came with it.<br><br>4. Goat Neck (4.5/5) *seasonal*<br>This is a very very heavy meat dish. It's easily pulled part, but because it came at the end, it's just too much for me to finish and rage about it (after 3 meat dishes lol). Good first impression but couldn't finish coz i've had too much. Reminded me of lamb shank.<br><br>5. A blood orange surprise (3/5)<br>I didn't like the citrus cake that covered the surprise (blood orange sorbet) in side of it. It's not moist enough for my taste. The entire dessert leans toward sour, which is not my favorite flavor but it sort of lightens me up after all that meat i've eaten. Beautiful plating though.<br><br>---------------------------------------<br>I came here again with another friend. Here are some of the other dishes we ordered:<br><br>Roasted cauliflower (5/5):<br>I don't even like cauliflower, ok? But this is so good. The cauliflower is buttery. Topped with pine nuts and mint, it gives the dish an earthy feeling with hints of pleasure and spikes. <br><br>Grilled shrimp (4.5/5):<br>I'm somewhat allergic to the shell of shrimp. My friend who doesn't even like shrimp LOVED this dish. We both did. It's topped with lots of veggies and kumquats. Very flavorful. The shrimp was fresh and crisp. <br><br>Dark matter pot de creme (5/5):<br>I didn't like the dessert last time. <br>I loved this one. <br>It's mysterious but also beautiful. <br>Topped with ginger caramel and sesame (one of my favorite flavor) foam, you have to scoop to the bottom of the cup and uncover the treasure. The combination of sesame, coffee, and ginger caramel was so heavenly. This is a chilled dessert and definitely lightens the entire meal with additional flavor combinations.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Uo_sExDow_1Dt5PTi7TYOA/348s.jpg", "caption": "Dark matter pot de creme"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KE4yCOXZhrLZfz7JJxWHbg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Pig face"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BSdlBTX2dxuPqf85z97fpQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Grilled shrimp"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Stephanie Izard is insanely talented!

A lot of event-goers will start their night here, so the place empties out, ever so slightly.

Before I start, just make sure you make reservations to come and dine here otherwise you will be waiting a very long time and might not get a chance to dine until much later in the night.<br>Service is great the moment you walk in, hostess greets you and makes you feel at home. The waiting area is a big size, they are used to having people wait around for a table, so even that part of the experience is good. <br>We had made reservations ahead of time through open table and only waited a couple of minutes for our table to be ready. The menu is very diverse, a lot of new takes on your favorite dishes. Things come in a shareable size with the exception of the crudo. <br>The cauliflower is one of the best things I've ever tasted! WOW just WOW! Soft and crunchy, juicy, you name it... a foodies heaven. <br>Another favorite was the pork shank. Literally comes off the bone and melts in your mouth! Enough to feed two. The desserts are also great! Pineapple upside down... hands down need to try this when you come in and the chocolate dessert the have is another must try! <br>Come with an empty stomach and be sure to order as much from the menu as you can because it's all delicious and worth trying!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Being newbie in Chicago eating scene I decided of course put my faith in what I could find online when it came to must try places. Girl and the Goat came up as a must try place recommended by locals as well as good ol Yelp. I had a hard time getting to the place, and for a Wednesday night, the only reservation I could get in was at 1030pm. A scant half hour before closing. I couldn't wait for it to be my sole dinner since it was late so it was actually more of late night snack. I had come very close to abandoning such a luxurious practice as eating 4 meals a day. Also it was  quite far from my hotel, but in the end, Girl and the Goat did not disappoint and it became one of my favorite experiences in Chicago, food or otherwise! <br><br>First things first, the staff was very informative, helpful and cheery, I really did feel welcome as my waitress answered my inquiries of what her favorites were as well as on a side note, what else Chicago had to offer. The atmosphere is your typical retro wire coil bulb yellow light wood and iron stylish throwback. Bustling with customers it's a lively place with lots going on. Fine for a date, but be prepared to speak up.<br><br>Finally, the food! It should come as no surprise but a place like this is supposed to be a venue for food to be bold, creative and experimental. Small, artful dishes meant to be shared is the motif so savor those bites in between the conversation or just close your eyes and enhance those taste buds like I did. Some dishes can be made as  half portion as my waitress so kindly marked on the menu for me. Still, even the half dishes may be enough to get a taste if you're with someone so you can try more variety. Ask!<br><br>Onto the specific dishes I ordered: Escargot dumplings, Wood fired Eagle Rock Oysters, Goat Belly Confit, and finally a dessert (I know, quite the anomaly for yours truly) of the dark matter pot de creme.  The oysters and dumplings came first. The oysters were wood fired, so in between the fried and raw options but nicely done. Served with horseradish, bacon and preserved lemon. Pretty good, though the horseradish could've had just a little more kick, the bacon was perfectly diced to flavor as well as add to the texture of the dish. Escargot dumplings were served with a bacon tamarind sauce with celery, escarole and crispy onions. Dumpling was properly cooked and the sauce was inventive, if a little on the salty side. I found it best when soaked into the crispy onions and greens and applied to a bite of the dumpling. If it had just stopped at these two dishes I think this place wouldn't have quite gotten a 5 rating from me. Quite good and interesting but it was the next dish that really pushed it into the 5 rating range.<br><br>I cannot say enough good things about the Goat belly confit. I knew it was going to be an over the top rich dish...bourbon butter? Crab AND lobster? With the fennel covering it it didn't look that heavy but make no mistake, this one will coat your taste buds. Of course, in a wonderfully decadent way...My first bite included a little bit of everything and what I noticed first was the fragrance of the bourbon butter. Food entices all the senses... some more than others but smell is usually a precursor, a tease before taste and texture. This time it unexpectedly stowed away with those two but it turned out to be a welcome guest! I instinctively closed my eyes to enjoy it. If i had been in a conversation with a date, I would have asked for some silence to appreciate it! <br><br>After that piece de la resistance I decided that since I was here I might as well try dessert. The dark matter pot de creme looked like your typical pot de creme but I just can't resist things with sesame. It also had some ginger which if used subtly and is just divine. It was on the same level as the first two dishes very good....if not just needed a little refinement for my taste. The sesame brittle pieces could've been slightly smaller and the ginger could've been toned down just a little. <br><br>In the end, one of my most memorable eating experiences. It gets the coveted 5 stars not only based on the food which is strong for sure, but on inventiveness and great service. I'm coming back next time I'm in Chicago for sure. There's lots more to try!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/m0oAueeczdCTQ_EMRTEqdw/348s.jpg", "caption": "Fire Cooked Oyster with horseradish and bacon"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-d8CTxQfC8UYXb4haM8a7A/168s.jpg", "caption": "Escargot Dumplings with Bacon Tamarind Sauce"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OHPGaq9jOjLRq_3VKY_HWg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Goat Belly Confit with Crab, Lobster and Bourbon Butter"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "This was the best meal I ate during my 5 day stay in Chicago!

We had a reservation for 8:30 on a Friday, which was made a month in advance. We waited between the bar and hostess stand for about fifteen minutes for our table to open up. It was very busy, so we felt a little bit awkward and in the way as servers walked by with trays of food. The hostess who seated us identified us and said, \"Hi, David, your table is ready,\" which was a nice touch. We came hungry and were ready to begin our meal! <br><br>We waited for maybe ~five more minutes before our water glasses were filled and our server arrived. Our server recommended we order 2-3 dishes each. We decided to forego drinks in lieu of ordering more food (we love to eat!). We ordered six dishes at once and then the kitchen decided which courses should be brought out in what order/combination. <br><br>Roasted cauliflower. I've had this veggie menu item in the back of my head for years after reading a delicious description by Candice G., our former Yelp Chicago 'burbs CM. The dish definitely lived up to my expectations! The pickled peppers definitely gave the dish a bit of a kick, but I still consumed it easily (and I'm a heat-averse person). The mint and pine nuts also worked really well with the big chunks of cauliflower. <br><br>Chickpea fritters. My boyfriend remarked that the fritters were basically like \"fried hummus\" and he meant that in the best possible way. The fritters were like eating clouds--so smooth and light! The yogurt, garam masala, rosemary, and green mango worked magnificently. I would definitely order this dish again. <br><br>Grilled baby octopus. This was a great dish, but by the time it arrived, I was already almost full from half of the previous two dishes! We got most of it to-go so we could still at least sample the rest of our meal. My only complaint about this dish was that the octopus was a little chewier than I prefer and it was a little overly-salty. Still a great dish, though! I thought there was a pretty liberal amount of octopus (other reviews complained about there not being enough).<br><br>Sauteed green beans. My boyfriend was underwhelmed by this dish and we agreed it could have used more cashews. The fish sauce wasn't fishy at all, which was excellent. Even though it was slightly saltier than I prefer, it was still the best green bean dish I've ever had. We took most of this home for leftovers!<br><br>Ham frites. The fries were pretty standard in the best way--fairly skinny and not overly crispy or oily. They were covered in what reminded me of a cross between a bacon crumble and fine dust. The ham dust liberally topped the fries and the tomato aioli plus cheddar beer dipping sauces were exquisite. They were very rich. <br><br>Wood oven-roasted pig face. This signature G&G dish was a must, so I tried a bite even though I don't eat meat! The sunny-side egg was cooked to absolute perfection. My boyfriend remarked that it was really fatty, which could be interpreted as \"either the best thing in the world or the worst thing in the world.\" It was really, really tasty. The cilantro and red wine-maple were smeared decoratively on the plate.<br><br>Miso-butterscotch budino. We were absolutely stuffed by this point, but there was no way we were leaving without trying a G&G dessert. We went with this dessert on the recommendation from our waitress and we didn't know what to expect. (What is a budino?) I still can't really explain it, but it was really great. You can't go wrong with candied cashews! <br><br>Overall, this was a really fantastic experience. Some of these bites were simply magical! My only complaint was that there was too much food. Three dishes per person is DEFINITELY way too much. I recommend ordering four dishes total for two people, plus dessert; that would be the sweet spot. Portions are pretty generous. I felt like we got great value for the food + cost. Customer service felt a little off originally because no one acknowledged or apologized for our table being 15 minutes late past the reservation.

Such a unique dish. I've never had soft shell crab like it. The crab was tender and fried for a nice, but delicate crunch. The strawberry added a little sweetness and the rice was amazing. We cleared the bowl pretty quickly.<br><br>Wood oven roasted pig face (sunny side egg. tamarind. cilantro. red wine-maple. potato stix) - after reading rave reviews about this dish, we had to get it. Worth it. The meat was moist and tender and the egg just melded the entire dish together. I loved it and so did the bf.<br><br>Goat confit with lobster - this was on the specials menu. While probably my least favorite of the bunch because I'm not a huge fan of lobster, my bf took one for the team and just so generously ate the majority of this dish. The lobster was sweet and buttery and the goat was on par.<br><br>Crisp braised pork shank (buttermilk dressing. grilled spring onion kimchee. naan) - wow. just wow. so much meat that falls off the bone. I made little pizzas out of mine. I layered my naan with the buttermilk dressing, the kimchee, and topped it off with some pork. Get in my belly.<br><br>Drinks: My bf ordered an old fashioned and I kept to my roots with a 21st Amendment watermelon beer.<br><br>When it came time for dessert, we took a look at the menu and had to pass.

The butter I could just eat by the spoon full and I feel similarly about the pickled relish. And the sausage...mama mia!<br><br>Nantucket Bay Scallops (french lentils . beech mushrooms . celery root) - This was packed with flavor and the pureed lentils were an excellent compliment.<br><br>Roasted cauliflower (pickled peppers . pine nuts . mint) - I don't know how they did it, but the cauliflower tasted as if it's been marinated in deliciousness.<br><br>Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face (sunny side egg. tamarind. cilantro . red wine-maple. potato stix) - This was excellent and tasted like the ultimate breakfast.<br><br>Roasted Duck Breast (miso-marcona almond butter. rapini. gremolata) - It had good flavor, but the texture of the duck was not great, it was rather chewy. I've had a fair amount of rare-medium rare duck, and this may have been the chewiest I've encountered.<br><br>Confit Goat Belly (bourbon butter . lobster n' crab . fennel) - This was good, but sounded better than it turned out to be.<br><br>We were fortunate enough to sit next to possibly the nicest dining couple ever.

Well, it was well seasoned and perfectly cooked. I don't think I can do this any better myself.

It came with a lemon sauce that complemented the perfectly cooked octopus really well. I wish they gave more pieces but maybe it's just my sister that ate them all first...<br><br>- Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face: Oh gosh, this was sooo amazing!! The face was one of the most tender meats I've ever eaten. When you dig into it, it feels like a delicacy and you can just taste the care that went into cooking it.

I was also bias and comparing it to the bomb octopus I had the previous night at Purple Pig.<br>- Wood oven roasted pig face ($19): SO good! The meat was incredibly tender and went well with the crispy stuff (I have no idea what that was).

Goat meat is a more tender meat that almost has the consistancy of a slow cooked brisket with a milder taste than beef.  They won't be able to tell that its goat.. they'll think its beef.  Then you can drop the bomb that they tried something new!  Help broaden their taste palate!  <br><br>And lastly... the bread.  Omg!  The fresh bread is to die for.  The bread menu changes which makes it exciting!  I had the Apple Bread (forgot the exact name), the Jack-o-Lantern, and the Green Bean Casserole.  If I could.. I could've eaten all 3 bread rolls in one sitting but I guess that's frowned upon.<br><br>Try to save room for dessert.  The Miso Butterscotch Budino is my favorite of the 4.  Its really hard because the PB&J was a close 2nd.  The crunchy brittle with the soft butterscotch budino... Yummo!  Its a little denser than pudding and the best culinary creation ever!  <br><br>The best part of my time here, was that I saw Chef Stephanie!  And she took a picture with us!!!! #geeked #celebsighting #bestnightever<br><br>Yes, i am done with my novel.  If you managed to read all this, thank you!  I could go on about this place!  Better yet, I hope this made you hungry and motivated to go here!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/h0ye2EeX3MWJCt4LYmSXXw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Must try a bread.

I Googled her mid-meal and I think she was working the night we were there, which means this is a good representation of how things should be/taste on a good night. While I might seem like a rookie to eating good food, the truth is I've been in China for the past five years and I seem to have missed the memo about why this restaurant is so special (it's the goat, right?). I try to identify the most highly rated, semi-affordable places (this is why I didn't go to Alinea) in the cities I plan to visit whenever I come back to the States and this place kept popping up, so I decided to give it a shot. <br><br>Our reservation was for 5:30 pm and when we arrived, the restaurant was already packed. We were squeezed into a two-person table with couples on both sides of us, less than an arm's length away. We could hear both couples' conversations clearly and it was super awkward. My wife and I tried to rationalize the lack of space and stifling noise by repeatedly stating that this was a popular, trendy restaurant and we were just lucky to have gotten reservations earlier than 9:30 pm.<br><br>My wife wasn't very hungry, but I had already walked like 20,000 steps, so I was starving. We got four dishes: softshell crab, cauliflower, pork shank, and goat empanadas plus the brioche, mainly because it was cheap and had decent reviews. <br><br>It was a reasonable amount of food, but I still got gelato at Eataly afterward.<br><br>The brioche came first. It was warm and fluffy, and the butter/jam combination was interesting. Definitely worth the $5 we paid for it. The goat empanadas came next. The goat was less distinctively \"goaty\" than I would have liked (tasted like carnitas), but the combination of avocado, cheese, and fruit salsa made this an excellent dish nonetheless. The softshell crab was fine, but not spectacular or unique. I love softshell crab more than most things in this world, but I wouldn't order this dish again...I'd probably try the calamari bruschetta for a fish dish instead. The cauliflower looked great when it arrived, but the excess amount of cheese made the dish way too salty and covered up the subtly sweet taste that roasting and caramelization brings out in cauliflower. I make better cauliflower at home. We didn't finish the dish. The pork shank was great, but I don't think I've ever had a pork shank that wasn't great; it's a meat that's difficult to mess up due to its high fat content, kind of like a chicken thigh. The buffalo sauce was fine (I would have liked it spicier, but my wife would not), as was the buttermilk dressing. The grilled onion/radish \"kimchi\" was not kimchi and did nothing for the dish, but I appreciated the extra greens to help with digestion. The naan was charred and chewy, as it should be. There could have been more though. <br><br>Overall, this place was decent, but I'm not sure it is worthy of its epic status on Yelp. Also, at $50 per person including tip, I don't think the dishes justify the prices. None of the dishes we ordered included any super premium ingredients (e.g., foie, truffles, caviar, lobster, uni) and they were all pretty small plates. While we were full by the end of the meal, it was mostly because of all the bread, cheese, and fatty pork we ate. The service was fine, but I saw a review that compared it to a three star Michelin restaurant, and it DEFINITELY was not that good. The waitress came to take our order almost 15 minutes after we received menus. <br><br>I guess this is a good restaurant to take an out-of-town foodie friend or a large group of yuppies and/or hipsters, but I wouldn't bring my mother (like the person next to us) or someone with whom I wanted to have a meaningful conversation. <br><br>I honestly think a lot of the 5-star reviews are due to \"group think\" and people tend to give it an extra star because they FINALLY got a chance to eat here (usually for their birthdays) after months or years of anticipation. If this restaurant was started by some smelly no-name dude with a gut and an off-putting personality and you came on a random weeknight after a long day of work, things would probably be different. <br><br>But yeah, this place is fine.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "If you've never had Bestia in Downtown Los Angeles, then Girl & the Goat may come off as a one of the most adventurous journeys you've ever taken your taste buds on...HOWEVER...since I've already experienced the orgasmic, mind blowing, thriller that is Bestia--the Girl & the Goat was simply...alright. <br><br>Food wise, like Bestia--tapas style--using a mix of eclectic modern ingredients to spice up  relatively familiar tapas...except everything at Girl and the Goat was 10x saltier than it should have been.<br><br>The grilled baby octopus was very soft and tender--but super salty.<br>String beans w/ anchovy sauce---crisp and fresh--but super salty.<br>Beef Tongue--mediocre at most--but super salty.<br>The best was probably the pork face--had a very comforting creamy taste, probably thanks to the egg yolk. --okay salty...<br>Raw oysters were good and fresh.<br><br>Service is excellent. <br><br>I had a few other things there but I suppose it was not as memorable as I'd like--but the hype definitely did not meet my expectations.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Get the pig face, the roasted cauliflower and some bread! The food was SO good, even better than I expected-- I've hoped to go to the Girl and the Goat ever since Stephanie opened it, since I'm a massive Top Chef fan--but the service was just ok. <br><br>We knew it would be difficult to get in without a reservation, so since we had a more flexible schedule, we set our goal at getting there early. We arrived at about 4:10 on a Friday and there was nobody waiting, so we got to put our names down first. We were told we could be seated right at 4:30 but would have to leave by 6, which was fine, since we had a flight to catch. <br><br>We were seated facing the kitchen (awesome!) at a big table that could fit about 8 people, but then about 10 minutes later, two people were seated in the seats facing us (weird!). I'm not sure why they do that, but I still liked watching the cooks work. We saw Stephanie Izard in the kitchen! She was super hands-on, both cooking and expediting. I was too chicken to ask for a picture, haha. <br><br>We started with the jack-o-lantern bread ($4), which was super soft (though with a lovely crust) and cheesy pumpkin bread served with brown butter butter. I could have just eaten that for dinner and been thrilled, honestly. They bake it across the street at the Little Goat Diner and it came out really warm. Then we got the beet salad ($9), which was probably the least exciting thing of the night, but it was still good. The wild striped bass was so surprising and delicious-- I didn't know how the mushroom mole and smoked clams would really work with it, but it was such a great combination. The fish was perfectly cooked-- it was soft but had great crisp skin. <br><br>Then came two of my favorites: the roasted cauliflower ($10 I think) and the pig face ($15 I think). I wish I could make my cauliflower so well at home! The pine nuts, parmesan, pickled peppers and mint (which was unexpected) really brought the whole dish together. Our waitress encouraged us to turn the pig face into a hash with tiny crispy potato strips and a fried egg. The whole mess was really crunchy and fatty and fantastic-- GET IT! <br><br>The goat loin ($22) was good since it wasn't too goat-y. I didn't know you could cook goat medium, but it was basically like a steak. It came with a autumn squash mix and \"goat xo sauce,\" which was mysterious but tasty. However, I couldn't stop thinking about the previous two dishes, which were definitely my favorites! <br><br>The portion sizes are really reasonable for a small plates place. With the five dishes (plus bread) that we got, we were stuffed. <br><br>Finally, some complaints about the service: The waitress took a long time to take our orders (I think it was around 4:50 when she finally did, and since they wanted us out quickly, I felt like she should have moved things along). This is probably kind of nitpicky, but I didn't like that she said she was there to \"hang out with us\" that evening. I'm all for casual, but I feel like that's just kind of weird! Also, though she told us to trust her with the food pacing, the first couple came out pretty quickly, then there was a long gap before we got the pig and the goat. <br><br>I hope to visit again with a reservation-- I'd love to sit at one of the seats right next to the expediting station, where you can watch everything in the kitchen super closely.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/J57v4ziomWo_CoI1n0GWnA/348s.jpg", "caption": "such a cute goat"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0AAkPG__EizmbI1keTjNWw/168s.jpg", "caption": "stephanie in the kitchen!"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IJVenb_lsBXQdATwfWj-2A/168s.jpg", "caption": "beet salad and YUMMY jack-o-lantern bread"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Definitely make reservations in advance!!

Don't be afraid to try this one! <br><br>CONFIT GOAT BELLY w/ bourbon butter, lobster n crab, & fennel. This was my least favorite dish of the night. It wasn't horrible but I didn't want any more after the first bite. I'd say pass on this one. <br><br>Overall, most of the dishes were good but not amazing. I really liked the space though.

We placed more drink orders and thought we wouldn't see him for awhile since we informed him we were waiting on our fourth. He stopped by every 2-3 minutes to annoy us and ask if we were ready to order. Finally we said, \"it's not even 5:45pm yet, we are waiting for our fourth person.\" He went away and sure enough 2-3 minutes later came back and sarcastically said \"We have another reservation for this particular table at 7:30pm, the hostess didn't know you all weren't here.\" I said, \"The hostess never asked, and again it's NOT even 5:45pm yet!\" So at that point he could tell we were all irritated.

Must get!! <br><br>Wood oven roasted pig face: this was a great dish as well. You breakdown and mix everything together and the yolk just brings all the flavors together with the pork. <br><br>Crisp braised pork shank: this dish is a very good portion. With a table of 4 we were all able to get a good portion of the fall-off-the-bone pork and the awesome sauces they paired it with. <br><br>Goat belly confit: awesome dish! The flavors were a little more light and fresh than the roasted pig face dish. <br><br>Calamari bruschetta: YOU MUST MUST TRY THIS. I love seafood, but it's so delicate to cook.

If you enjoy snacking on cauliflower, then this dish is a must.<br><br>Escargot Ravioli (Tamarind-miso sauce and bacon): Solid. I appreciate how the raviolis were perfectly al dente. Unfortunately, I thought the bacon was missing from this dish (like LeBron in the 4th Quarter) and can't say if the sauce was very memorable.<br> <br>Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face (Sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine-maple, and potato stix): No thank you. I just feel that it's over cooked and salted. I can't recommend this one.<br><br>Confit Goat Belly (Bourbon butter, lobster, crab, and fennel): It was decadent, dreamy, and savory.

There are over 5K pics and the menu is tiny--I'm just adding to the noise and I know it. But add I must. <br><br>The idea of the \"unexpected\" keeps coming back to me as I think about my experience with this place.<br><br>The food here was such a delicate and thoughtful surprise. Why isn't there a progressive goat-focused restaurant in every city? Chef has taken a humble (albeit delicious) protein and added a shocking lightness to it. Without reading any reviews I felt trust that this Top Chef winner would deliver something thing tasty. I was not prepared to see goat a whole new way.<br><br>The dishes all had a clean, light, crispness to them. Particularly the goat shank and the broccoli. There is some recognizable spice in the broth the shank was sitting in that speaks to something primal in me. The empanadas and ham frites (sigh--I cannot believe I ate ham anything) were solid and I liked them. Again, while not on a \"best of\" list, but in keeping with the theme, both were unexpected--I don't think the \"ham salt\" sold me, but conceptually, I appreciated how it built on an idea. <br><br>Can we talk about the short rib? I had not been eating animal protein and decided to eat some at G&G.  That short rib dish (and that shank) made it worth my while. The light, crispy, and dare I say....buttery pieces of meat were perfectly seasoned and tender and delectable. I'll skip the calamari next time and simply get two orders of the short rib.<br><br>Chef is rethinking food and how we interact with it at this place. Goat is a humble and common protein eaten all around the world. Yet in America it is an unusual ingredient to see on a menu. So often we see an ingredient as belonging to a certain people or region or cuisine.  All around me people were falling in love with their dishes. Which says that folks are ready to try something \"new\" and connect with it. <br><br>And when I thought I had had my fill, I had the goat cheese cheesecake. I don't care too much for desert--just not my thing---but this hit all my taste points. Hands down this is my favorite dessert. From anywhere. I hate to admit I miss that salty, creamy caramel with the tart goat cheese cheesecake sitting atop a  pretzel crust. I'm embarrassed that I enjoyed his so much. I'm so glad I don't live in his city b/c if I did, I'd be coming here too often. And eating desert every time.<br><br>The ingredient -goat--suggests something heavy and filling and complete. But each bite moves your mind to a new and unexpected place. Even the building is a surprise. It is dark and fairly unmarked. But the moment you step inside it is bursting and alive and warm. Like the food being cooked in the kitchen, it plays on and subverts our expectations to revel itself as something altogether different. <br><br>I appreciate the balance and I cannot wait to go back.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "My boyfriend and I went here for his birthday after reserving a table over a month in advance and it was well worth the wait.

Neither of us are big fans of oysters and were hesitant about these, but these were tasty and there was no visible fishy taste to them. <br><br>Bread- We got the Johnny Applecheese, which comes with apple butter and chili cheddar butter. Both spreads were delicious and the bread was warm and soft, which made it perfect as a filling appetizer. <br><br>Small Plates: Here's where we went a little wrong- we ordered many small plates as our waitress told us that it would be enough food. However, we quickly realized we had ordered too much as the plates come out when they're made. <br><br>Pierogies- This was the dish my boyfriend and I decided we both liked the least. It is a strange combination of flavors, but the sweet potato filling made the pierogies too sweet for both of our tastes. The mushrooms that came with it were delicious. <br><br>Wood fired shrimp- This is by far our favorite and we would return just for the shrimp. The amount of seasoning is perfect and the shrimp are cooked very well- not too chewy and a good texture. <br><br>Goat Satay- This plate came out last for us, so we were very full at this point. We had both never had goat, but it was quite tasty and not tough. It was seasoned well and not overly salty, which both of us appreciated. <br><br>Calamari Bruschetta- The calamari were cooked wonderfully in this dish- not too chewy but not raw. There is not a visible fishy taste on the calamari and both of us -who usually don't like calmari- greatly enjoyed this. There is a lot of bread and it is a little bit of a messy dish. <br><br>Dessert: <br><br>We got a small portion of the caramel corn and malt balls for free for my boyfriend's birthday. Neither of us are huge fans of popcorn but it tasted quite good. We liked the combination of the hard shell chocolate with the soft ice cream as well as the caramel corn. <br><br>We also got the dark matter pot de creme. It was a unique variety of flavors due to the chocolate mousse, sesame bark, and salted caramel. The caramel was very salty, so if you like sweeter caramel, this is not the dessert for you. The strangest part was the sesame flavor as that is not typically imagined as a dessert ingredient. At this point, I think both of us were about to burst so we only split a few bites of the huge cup. <br><br>Overall, we greatly enjoyed the meal and left very full.

As a party of one with limited stomach real estate, I would have to choose carefully! At the restaurant, I discovered that many dishes could be halved - half the quantity for half the price - which made my work a little easier. Based on this and the many comments here, I ended up ordering:<br><br>- duck tongues (whole portion) -- this came out as a starter.<br>- broccoli (half portion)<br>- goat empanadas (half portion)<br>- tiramisu<br><br>One of the commenters here wondered whether duck tongues were actually tuna. While there is actually (raw?) tuna in the dish, my waiter confirmed the fried things are indeed duck tongues! The tongues are warm and tender, and when you bite into them the texture is strangely like ... the feeling of a tongue ... and it is probably the closest you will ever come to making out with a duck. I also felt the broccoli was a highlight. The light char and cheesy sauce make this simple dish special.<br><br>The empanadas and tiramisu were good but not nearly as unique.<br><br>The server brought a second dessert \"on the house\" - I observed this happening again a few tables down, and have read about it happening to others here, so it must happen fairly regularly. It consisted of a delicious creamy ice cream, peanut brittle and peanut butter foam of some kind, in a grape / red wine vinegar sauce that was quite creative, bringing a sour taste to an otherwise sweet dish.<br><br>The service lived up to its reputation... the server was charming and helpful. The \"bonus\" dessert was nice, but I hadn't budgeted the stomach real estate for it, so I was not able to finish.<br><br>I can't think of any way the service or food could have been better, and I felt the price was fair.

We got lucky and got dinner reservations for Monday night. It was definitely packed when we arrived.<br><br>To start we had the Kohlrabi Salad with fennel, evalon, toasted almonds, apples and shiitake. One I've never even heard of Kohlrabi, but apparently it's a type of radish. I found the dish to be refreshing and full of flavor. You can taste each ingredient on its own as the dressing is not over powering and when you take each piece into one bite, it creates this wonderful taste. I can't even explain it, but I've never tasted anything like it before. All I can say it was a good way to start the meal.  <br><br>Next we had the Pan Roasted Drum Fish with autumn crisp apples, szechuan vinaigrette and vanilla bean-herb yogurt. The fish was cooked perfectly, soft on the inside, but crispy on the outside. This dish was also bursting with flavors, one moment it was sweet (vanilla bean yogurt), next it was tangy (szechuan vinaigrette). <br><br>Then we had the wood oven roasted Pig Face everyone talks about. Included with the pig was a sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine-maple and potato stix. They advise you mix it all together. The meat was soft and fatty, but when you eat it with the potato six it was crunchy.  <br>Another dish which was unlike any other with the various ingredients. <br><br>For dessert we ordered the one with peanut butter gelato covered in the chocolate magic shell and there were bits of chocolate cake. It was crunchy, soft sweet and nutty all in one. We also ordered the donut holes that were on top of an apple granita. The donut was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Eating the donut with the cream and apple granita, was like eating a deconstructed apple pie with a glass a milk. It tasted absolutely amazing.<br><br>They recommend two main plates a person, but I enjoy how we shared 3 main dishes and 2 desserts.  Overall I'm impressed by the creativity of the dishes and how the flavors vary.

Seared duck breast (4/5) - Duck tends to be fatty, but nope, not this one.  Very tender, much like the goat loin.  <br><br>5. Ham frites (4/5) - Never thought of fries as gourmet food, but the cheddar beer sauce builds a strong case.<br><br>The only \"half star\" deduction I would give is that the portions are a little on the small side for my taste.  But Girl & the Goat retains its five star rating due to its prompt service and the sheer creative approach it took with all of its offerings, especially the cauliflower and the goat loin.  I was left very impressed.  An unforgettable dining experience.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lPU6pFbd3k8JIce7e2Ypaw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Girl & the G(l)oat(er)"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kUKhiRKT9nqWmAxRdE5WZw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Best cauliflower dish.

As a lover of unique dining experiences and fan Stephanie Izard, I knew this would be right up my alley. But, let me tell you - getting reservations is a chore! I scoured Open Table for weeks, trying to snag a Friday or Saturday dinner reservation, as my M-Th schedule is too unpredictable. I didn't even care what time. (Hello, early birds?) Northing. Then, finally, I realized I could call the restaurant directly. I ended up having to schedule six weeks out, but at least I had something on the books.<br><br>When our reservation day finally arrived, we had high expectations. And the food and hospitality far exceeded anything we could have imagined! <br><br>The servers were knowledgeable, thoughtful, and downright skilled at their jobs. Our server knew every inch of that menu and did an excellent job anticipating our needs. <br><br>The food was great. The cocktails were great. (My husband said the beer was great.) The shared plate concept allowed us to try a variety of items, from goat empanadas to sweet corn pierogis to wood oven roast pig face (yes, pig face). But one of my favorite items was one that we almost skipped; do yourself a favor and order the \"Olive You.\" It is a warm bread with olives baked in, served with whipped feta and EVOO, and it was so delicious!<br><br>The downside: I can confirm that other reviewers' comments about the restaurant being loud and crowded is 100% correct. My husband actually commented that he was glad we knew each other already (as in, it wasn't a first date) because there was no way we were going to be able to have any conversation beyond a few phrases shouted across the table. Speaking of the tables, they were so close that each time the hostess seated a couple in our area, we watched her physically move the table out from the half-booth so the person sitting in the booth side could get to their seat. In fact, I could have easily rested my elbow on my neighbor's table.<br><br>But, does the food make up for the space/noise issues?

I was excited to try Stephanie Izard's restaurant after seeing her performance a few years ago on Top Chef. The only times that were available one month in advance were for 10:30 P.M. on a weekday so if you want an earlier time you should probably book at least 2 months in advance. <br><br>We arrived early and asked if it was possible to be seated earlier than our reservation time. The host was gracious and said we could wait at the bar and someone would come get us when a table was available. While waiting we tried the Thai One On, a lovely cocktail with rum, brandy, passion fruit-Thai chile syrup, and bitters. The drink was smooth and excellently crafted. It did taste more like a grapefruit infused drink rather than passion fruit though. We were also slightly disappointed that we couldn't taste more chile flavor in the drink. <br><br>When we were seated, our waitress explained that all the dishes are meant to be shared and medium size. For our party of 3 6-8 dishes would be a good amount to order. We ended up ordering 8 which left me pleasantly full but with no room for dessert. Our dishes were the raw oyster, goat empanada, squash blossom crab Rangoon, calamari bruschetta, divers scallops, pork face with fried egg, grilled Walter's chicken, and goat belly with lobster. My favorite dishes were the raw oyster, pork face, and the squash blossom. Each dish in general had a lovely presentation and had a kaleidoscope of colors pleasing to your eye. Overall I enjoyed my meal, but I did notice that the dishes got saltier as the night wore on. The goat belly and the chicken were probably the saltiest of all the dishes we ordered. Each dish ranged from the mid teens to low 20s. I think our most expensive dish was the chicken at $21.<br><br>The goat is really well executed here. While most goat meat I've tried has that hint of gamey, barnyard taste to it, this goat meat tasted very clean, almost like a richly flavored beef. <br><br>Service was excellent. Water was refilled promptly, dishes taken away efficiently, and we were checked up on as needed. The timing of our dishes worked out well since the next dish would come near the end of us finishing our current dish. <br><br>The noise level of the restaurant itself was loud, partially due to the full seating of tables and the loud music playing on the speakers, so we had to shout a bit to each other to hear what we were saying.

I was so immensely grateful for this service, as I'd never been, and wanted to try as much as possible. They offered it without me even bringing it up!<br><br>Everyone knows their food is the best, but what really made me want to write this review was the service i got tonight. I feel stupid not getting my server's name but she was a warm, kind woman with a ponytail and she is a rockstar. She checked on me just enough that I was never left wanting anything, but not too much as to smother me. She hooked me up with the mocktail and making two dishes that usually included meat be strictly pescatarian for me. She was super kind and made me feel at home although it was my first time. As a server myself, I so appreciated the attention and care paid even though I was there as the kitchens were closing. If there's a way for her to get a raise, I recommend it. I was served by many people who brought my dishes and bussed my table and everyone on staff was delightful and wonderful tbh. The food can be stellar and without a stellar FOH, the restaurant would be nothing.

And believe me, there will be a next time. We re-booked before we left. <br><br>I also enjoyed watching the cooks and prep cooks whip it up. There were no measuring cups for anything. They were throwing a pinch of this and scoop of that all night long. Another treat of the night was that a few people in our party of 11 had dietary restrictions (gluten free and Pescatarian).

When entering the restaurant, the first thing I noticed was how dark it was. Although the tables, floors, and roof were wood, the majority of the walls were painted an obsidian-like shade with the exception of a small area of exposed brick. I felt like we were spelunking as we traveled to our table near the back of the restaurant. Very trendy ambience!<br><br>Unfortunately, the tables in our area were pretty cramped. The table was scooted out before I could reach my bench seat, and I could easily participate in the conversations of the diners on either side of me. At one point, I felt like scooting our table one inch closer to the one next to us to see if they would be obligated to share food with us, but proper decorum stopped me. The menu is interestingly divided into veggie, fish, meat, and goat.<br><br>Shishito peppers - The seemingly small bowl packed a bunch of peppers and some surprising jolts of heat. The top layer was covered in parmesan cheese, but the peppers on lower levels had very little cheese. Most of the peppers were not spicy, but 4-5 of the smaller peppers were FIRE. I was not prepared for the spiciness, so it took a bit for my mouth to recover after a real hot one. Overall, this dish was super oily. The grease took away from the taste of the parmesan and added nothing to the deflated peppers.<br><br>Beef tongue - This was one of my favorite things. The quarter-sized pieces of beef were so soft and almost melted in my mouth. The masa chips and salsa verde were bomb. I wanted to lick the bottom of the bowl to get the last drops of the yummy salsa.<br><br>Szechuan goat satay - I grew up eating goat, but not like this. Medium cooked goat corny dogs on sprout-covered skewers atop creamy apple-potato puree. There was a lot going on with this dish. I could have done without the sprouts, they did not have enough bite to add anything texture-wise, but the goat was tasty and slightly sweet. The mashed potatoes were very buttery and smooth.<br><br>Pig face - Our server said this was world-famous, and I could see why. How often do I eat face? My first bite was all crisp, so I was not too excited, but delving deeper into the food, I discovered more and more elements. The pig face comes stuffed with potato stix, which I think are mini hash browns, and topped with a sunny -side up egg. This dish was very fatty and crunchy and sweet and crispy! There was a lot of flavor to the pork, and the fat surprisingly did not seem too greasy.<br><br>Bittersweet chocolate - This dessert was ordered after eyeing our neighboring table's plate. The majority of the dish is a cakey-brownie with a generous scoop of shitake-caramel gelato. I loved the gelato and really enjoyed the saltiness of it which enhanced the dish as a whole. There were different textures to our brownie, and I preferred the gooier parts. I was very pleased with the amount of dessert present and probably could not have finished the entire thing on my own, which I never thought could happen.<br><br>The service here was excellent and our served easily answered all of my pressing questions. Even though you must walk down a dark stairway to get to the bathroom, I liked how the bathroom stalls are completely isolated from one another.

The pig face is exactly as everyone describes it - a rich, decadent, flavorful dish that you must get if you dine here.

It's easy to see why, the ambiance is romantic enough for couples, bustling enough for small groups to not ruin the mood and dark enough for solitary diners to face-f**k food without judgement. <br><br>The gent at the bar was knowledgeable of all the restaurant had to offer and warned me that some of the dishes were a little bigger and it would affect how much else I could order. Poor soul hadn't seen me eat before.<br><br>The dishes I ended up ordering were:<br>1.) Escargot Ravioli - buttery creamy and quite flavorful. Frankly the pasta was a little heavier than I'd like, it covered a lot of the escargot flavor, but still much yums.<br><br>2.) Crisp Braised Pork Shank - this was the dish he warned me about. Typically 4 people share this plate (alongside other dishes), it did not stop me, I demolished it with much enthusiasm. The meat was crispy on the outside, fall-off-the-bone tender on the inside. With naan and some homemade kimchi buffalo sauce it was Peking duck made out pig. Delicious!<br><br>3.) Confit Goat Belly - this dish was actually the 2nd to come out but I saved it to the end to review (so that only the diehard readers get to benefit from my wisdom) Bourbon butter, lobster and crab and fennel.

Great lemon and bacon accents.<br>YO QUIERO TACO BREAD: Not even going to try to make this sound classy.

Fresh, crunchy, flavorful. I really enjoyed this. <br>GOAT EMPANADAS with smoked blueberry tapenade and avocado: The dish I was most looking forward to! Two small and delicate handpies, filled with shredded goat. The meat was on the dry side, but the flavor was meaty and complemented well by the fruit and avocado. Wish there was a third empanada for this $16 order.<br>CONFIT GOAT BELLY with bourbon butter, lobster n crab, and fennel: Underwhelming. The belly was a little overcooked and the flavor profile heavily favored the seafood rather than serving to highlight the goat.

Some said it was too overwhelming and others said it was innovative. Some said good service and others said bad service. While still others said the food was way too salty. However, I have been wanting to try it since it opened and was very excited he chose to take me here for our anniversary. <br><br>The food: The food was amazing! I really have no complaints about how any of the food tasted. The chickpea fritter was my lease favorite and it was still really tasty. The chickpea fritters alone were nothing special. Great texture, but not too flavorful, however, when paired with the yogurt sauce that goes on top it was heavenly. The vegetables that came with it were cooked and seasoned perfectly. The calamari bruschetta was amazing. I love grilled calamari and this is cooked perfectly. The bread was crispy yet soft enough to soak up all the flavor of the bruschetta. It was very good. The goat Carpaccio was also very delicious. It was full of flavor and the goat was very tender. However, the star of the night was the woodoven roasted pig face. When you mix everything together it is unlike anything you have ever had in your life. Truly one of the best things I have ever eaten. It was followed by an amazing chocolate truffle cake, which is devine if you are a chocolate lover like myself. <br><br>The service: So the service was a little up and down. We had a reservation, but got there a little early so we sat by the bar area to wait to be seated. They have a nice lounge area with comfy couches. The person waiting in that area wasn't really friendly. She didn't bring a drink menu or ask us if we wanted anything. She just sat at the side of the bar, talking with the bartenders. If it wasn't so busy I wouldn't have minded, but it would have been nice to be acknowledged. It was really crowded in this area, and some people were eating so it got cramped fast, not that I minded, just something to be mindful of. Even when we sat down, the tables are pretty crammed together. Our waitress was top notch. We were little lost since this is a different dinning experience that what we are used to, but she provided us with knowledge. She even helped us make our plate so we had just the right amount of food for the two of us. However, the ending was the best part of our night. We ordered champagne and the waitress asked us what we were celebrating, when we told her it was our anniversary, she smiled and wished us congratulations. We thought that was the end of it, but all of the sudden, they brought us out a 2nd dessert ON THE HOUSE. This was completely unexpected and we felt greatly appreciative. When we thanked her, she said it was nothing and milestones need to be acknowledged. Those are the types of things that keep customers coming back!

Reservations can be hard to come by and it makes sense because this place was hopping on a late Sunday evening. <br>The streets were empty and so wete neighboring restaurants, but when we walked in to the Girl and the Goat, it was alive loud and jam packed. The kitchen is an open concept and the ambiance is nice. <br>I just felt like it was too loud and cramped. It felt like we were sharing a table with our neighbors.  <br>The food is fabulous and sort of tapas style. The fried chickpeas were so creamy and flavorful.  Next we shared the escargot ravioli. I loved this dish.  The bacon sauce with the celery, almost gave the dish an Asian taste and some crunchy texture.  The next plate we shared was the Pig Face. The name sounds scary, but was far from that.  The pig face (not an actual snout staring right us) was served with potatoes, sunny side up egg and cilantro.  It was so tasty.  <br>Our meal ended with some of the best desserts I have ever had.  We had the Dark Matter Pot de Creme and the Caramel Corn and Malt Balls. Let me start by saying I am a sucker for malt anything and caramel corn, so for this to be incorporated into a single dish, rocked my world.  The Pot de Creme was equally delicious and had a more savory flare to it.   The cocktail list was appealing, but we stuck with the house red wine which was enjoyable. <br>Prices were quite reasonable for this caliber of restaurant. <br>Service felt rushed and less than personal.   <br>Overall, very enjoyable meal and phenomenal food.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I can never resist provocative flavors and innovative dishes and Girl & the Goat delivers on both fronts.  <br><br>----The Food----<br>Crisp Braised Pork Shank ($26)- WOW. One bite of this tender, succulent pork shank and I delved into my own happy world--nothing else mattered.  Sharing this flavorful creation will be the worst part of your meal.  The Kimchee wing sauce and buttermilk dressing make perfect, tasteful dips for the pillowy soft naan too. <br><br>Roasted Pig Face ($18)- This wood oven dish was good, but fell short of expectations, especially since it's one of the more popular signature plates on the menu. It comes with a sunny side egg,  crispy potato stix, drizzled in tamarind vinaigrette, red-wine maple sauce and cilantro oil.  It's reminiscent of the pig face at Animal in LA, but more subdued in taste.  It's messy, it's good, just not mind blowing.<br><br>Grilled Marinated Pork Belly ($15)- Served with radicchio and an aromatic green sauce resembling pureed cilantro and avocado, this pork belly plate had an uplifting, light flavor, but the consistency of the pork belly was oft-putting.  I felt it was undercooked, giving it a chewier consistency than I can bear.  <br><br>Confit Goat Belly ($19)- While I'm a big fan of this order, I disliked the tiny portion.  Smothered in heavy bourbon butter and sprinkled sparingly with lobster/crab, it's a comforting plate that didn't taste as gamey as I thought it would.  <br><br>Roasted Cauliflower ($11)- Accompanied with pickled peppers, pine nuts and mint, it's a refreshing appetizer that is as good as Bar Ama's in LA.<br><br>Pan Roasted Halibut ($18)- I hate fish, but this masterpiece melts in your mouth and makes your eyes roll back to your skull.  Made with marcona almond butter, white asparagus, blueberry nuoc cham, the flavors are wonderfully surprising and unique.  Amazing.<br>-----<br>Conclusion: 4.5 Stars. Your inner carnivore will thank you, after giving the Girl & the Goat a visit.  I believe Chef Izard didn't need to be on Top Chef to gain popularity because her evocative and exquisite dishes speak for themselves.  The food, service, atmosphere, and even decor have a boisterous spirit that's contagious--you'll be overjoyed to be there.  I just wish the portions were bigger and the prices were cheaper.<br><br>Extra Notes:<br>-Accepts credit card<br>-Make reservations before hand!

I was iffy when I saw the little lively mint leaves in the bowl; I absolutely hate eating mint leaves. I love the flavor of mint, but you can LEAVE the fresh thing out of my plate...except here. Here, it fit so perfectly; subtle and not in your face. We also got the goat belly confit off of the goat menu. I loved the buttery-ness. Last plate was the pork shank. This thing was crispy! This was where things went a little off for me. Maybe I had expected a lot from this since we enjoyed the other three plates so much. The meat fell off the bone, which was a plus, but I didn't get much flavors. The buffalo sauce was different, but not so much in a positive way.

Why on earth were we refused to book a table the day before & why on earth were we told we'd be guaranteed a table upon entry?? Puts his name down for a table and heads to the bar, i texted him from my cab on route to the location and asked him to ask the bartender if they served Sangria because God forbid it's a beautiful day out in Chicago and I fancy a nice cold, refreshing drink! Gets the DIRTIEST look from the bartender as if to say \"If it's not on the cocktail list I'm not making it\" <br>Upon my arrival, I sit down and was greeted at the bar by 3 of the most miserable, unwelcoming, grouchy, judgy and down right rude bar tenders I have ever had the displeasure of meeting! I had my heart set out on Sangria so I needed a minute to decide on an alternative which pissed off this girl so much she literally rolled her eyes at me and walked away. She never came back to me to find out if I'd decided on something so I had to call on the other male bar tender to attend to me! Got our drinks, about 40 minutes later I'm feeling extremely parched and realise I don't have any water! Not only through experience, bar tenders pour you a glass of water the second you sit down and are glancing over the menu, but out of 20-25 people sitting at the bar, my date and I were the ONLY 2 who were not offered water!! This guy was re filling the water glasses of the couple to our left AND our right, casually without taking the time to care that we didn't HAVE any water glasses to top up!! <br>When I asked him for some water, he didn't apologize for not giving us any, honestly felt like I'd just asked him to give up both his kidneys for me seriously it was SO UNCOMFORTABLE!!! 3 painful and excruciating hours later, we had already agreed that there was no way in hell we were staying there for food, which might I add we planned to have at 5:30pm NOT 8:40!!!!!!!<br>We kindly declined our table and asked for the Cheque, we paid but before leaving my date stayed at the bar polishing off his drink while he looked after my bag, coat etc. apparently while I was gone he was asked to move!!!!!

We were only sat at the bar waiting on a table we thought we were going to be given upon entry because they refused us a reservation, treated us like absolute scum, gave us the dirtiest looks all night & now to top it off you're belittling us in front of other customers playing \"good cop\" opting to treat them with the courtesy and respect you should have treated us with??

I assumed she was being pretentious and aiming to have the dish removed from her bill. Then at dinner after I had ordered the confit and we were talking about the girl in the lounge, I started to realize that the confit had been the dish in question. I was open-minded, but trust me when I say it was one of the worst dishes I've ever had. We passed it around the table just so we could have a shared awful experience.

I also enjoyed the ham frites. The fries are thinly cut and comes with two different dipping sauces. I both the sauces, but the cheddar beer sauce was out of control. I had to control myself from not finishing that dipping sauce myself!

We heard from a few people we knew that this was the place to go. I did see a mix amount of reviews but my cousin said I had to go. So we tried to make reservations 3 weeks in advance because we heard it was hard to get in and we still only got a 11:30 pm reservation. But we thought hey we are on vacation lets eat something a little earlier it should be ok. <br><br>So we get there at 10:45 hoping they could take us early. It doesn't hurt and we were already ready anyways. So we get there and they said they probably cant seat us till 11:30 so we said ok that is fare lets go by the bar area and relax. They do have a lounge area you could eat at that was really empty when we were there but the seating just a little more uncomfortable. But its up to you if you cant get a reservation try walking in and sitting there.<br><br>So, as we are getting walked to our table they said its your lucky day you get to see at the Chef's Table. Although this was a cool experience I will say it gets very hot because your so close to the stoves. Also you don't know what to order because a million things come out and EVERYTHING looks so good. So It is a little confusing because your wondering what you should eat. <br><br>We had: <br>The green beans and those were surprisingly really good. I was a little nervous to order them because I felt like they are just green beans but I was so wrong. The combination of flavor was excellent. It does have fish sauce so if your not into that I would not order this. <br><br>Complementary: because we were sitting here we did get something on the chef which was the cauliflower which was also very good. The pine nuts give it a nice crunch and it was really good. <br><br>Bread: we had the Sweet Onion Brioche Tarragon butter. Spring lamby jam when we were waiting. The bread was average but the onion spread was amazing. It was sweet and it reminded us of something my fiance mom makes. It is a caramelized onion on bread. <br><br>Fish - We had the halibut. OMG BEST THING on the menu! You have to have this. I believe it was the best fish I ever had and we live in Vegas and have had some incredible fishes but this was excellent. I would come back here and order 3 of these and just make it my meal. It melts in your mouth and it was just so tasty. <br><br>Pig face - so we ordered this because everyone suggested it and it was very good. The meat is tender and juicy. It also has a crunch to it.<br><br>Goat- since this is called girl and a goat we thought we had to order a goat dish. Confit Goat Belly Bourbon​ Butter . Lobster and Crab . Fennel was what we ordered. Although the dish looked very pretty it was my least favorite. I would pass on this one. The lobster and crab on the meal is really good but the goat wasn't for me. Its a very small piece of meat and it isn't worth the money your spending on it. Overall our experience was great and I highly recommend this spot.

I would recommend this dish.<br><br>Crisp Braised Pork Shank: For the most part the pork was perfectly cook and tender.  Quite tasty too. There's a few dry pieces.  I did not like the squash shitake kimchee.  This was our last dish.

We were excited to take our seats, even though our seats were at 10:15pm on a Sunday. What can I say, even with 2-3 weeks notice that was the only reservation available! Taking our seats was even harder than that, though-10:15pm on a Sunday it was packed like sardines, couples waiting ahead of us for what seemed like a while for their tables. We didn't get our seats until 10:45. Thank you for the free bread as a token of your apologies. I would've preferred the sparkling wine you brought to the couple beside us, but I won't complain too much.<br><br>When finally sitting down, we were surprised to get a look at the menu-not many dishes over $15 on the whole thing. I was expecting to pay more, I'll put it that way. We were advised to go for about 2 dishes per person, and we did. Sticking to our pescetarian lifestyle, we chose the grilled octopus salad (sans ham), soft shell crab rice, ramp and rhubarb pierogies and the sesame shishito peppers. We enjoyed two cocktails with this meal, and we weren't really feeling like drinking more that night, though the wine list was nice. <br><br>The standout dish for me was the sesame shishitos and soft shell crab. The crab was the smallest portion by a lot-one pan fried soft shell served on top of sticky rice-though it was delicious I wanted more of it. The shishitos were opposite; it was a huge crock of small delicious peppers. Usually, when I have a dish of shishito peppers, it comes with like, 9 peppers. There were dozens here. They were smothered in cheese and sesame and were amazing.<br><br>We ended the night with cinnamon toast crunch rice pudding, again with rhubarb. There was so much rhubarb! I appreciated the ultra seasonal ingredients, but like 3 of the 5 dishes contained rhubarb. I guess they had a plethora of it that night.<br><br>Overall, I did enjoy the meal, and once we were seated everyone was attentive and kind. I didn't enjoy waiting, standing next the the bar breathing over other diners for a half hour after our reservation time. I get that it's busy but it can get a bit unreasonable to continue taking reservations when you don't actually have the space or the staff.

It came with a few crazy thin shavings of bread, and the raw fish which was pretty bland. <br><br>Goat Empanadas - These were really good. They came with healthy amount of guacamole that pairs well with the empanadas. The meat inside was tender and flavorful.<br><br>Wood Fired Halibut - One of the best pieces of fish that I have ever had. Very moist and the sauce was incredible. Order this for sure if you are a fan of fish.<br><br>Wood oven roasted pig face - This was good, but after all the hype and seeing thousands of pictures/reviews for it on here I thought it fell flat. It just tasted like a bacon and egg breakfast that you can get at any place in the city. <br><br>Atmosphere - Looks cool on the inside, tables are super close together and it's pretty loud. Depending on the table you get, it can be hard to hear your server. The other part about sitting so close to people is you hear their conversations whether you like it or not.

I was grateful they could accommodate us last minute but you could tell our seating was where they stick walk-ins and last minute accommodations. Kind of in the corner yet still in the middle of all the traffic. And the kitchen was hot. It didn't bother me, though, cause I'm always cold and the kitchen staff was very friendly. <br><br>We ordered five meals between the two of us: chickpea fritter, escargot ravioli, crispy beef short ribs, honey sambal brioche, and confit goat belly. The waitress said she would choose the best course lineup and would take care of us. The first meal was the crispy beef short ribs. They were definitely crispy on the outside but not as tender as I'd like on the inside. The sauce was tangy yet sweet with pops of grapefruit and avocado. The sauce was real good. <br><br>Crispy beef short ribs: 7/10<br><br>Then came the chickpea fritter. So delicious. It came with tons of fixins which was like an explosions of flavor with a little spice. <br><br>Chickpea fritter: 9.5/10<br><br>Next came the star of the show: escargot ravioli. It was very light with the perfect chewiness of the escargot. The escargot was very traditional garlic and butter and the whole plate had onion crisps on top. It was by far the best part of the meal. <br><br>Escargot ravioli: 10/10<br><br>A surprise (complementary) fourth meal of wood grilled broccoli followed. This was probably due to us making friends with the kitchen staff who was responsible for the broccoli order. We were pretty excited! It had a nice smokey flavor to it and the blue cheese sauce and spiced rice crispies were the perfect complement. If I were to go again, though, I would probably pass on the broccoli and explore other menu items. <br><br>Wood grilled broccoli:  7/10<br><br>Finally came the confit goat belly. The goat belly had a crispy exterior but the middle melted in your mouth. It wasn't as fatty as pork belly that I've had in the past, but still good. The star of the plate was the lobster n' crab that accompanied the goat belly.  This was so rich and delicious, especially with the bourbon butter sauce. <br><br>Confit goat belly: 8/10<br>Lobster n' crab in bourbon butter: 10/10<br><br>Overall you can see the meal was pretty great. The waitress asked if we were full (which we were) but we asked what happened to the bread. She said \"oops\" and asked if we wanted it now. Personally I don't think bread is the best way to end a meal so we decided to skip it. She then brought us our check, which was correct, but she didn't provide any concessions for messing up our meal. We did get a complementary dish, which was awesome, but we also didn't get to try something we really wanted. At least give us the iced tea for free!

The pig face was also really good because it came with a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg and had nice fried crispy strips. My girlfriend thought this was the best dish of the night and I have to agree. Unfortunately, the goat dishes were a bit underwhelming. The goat emapanadas only came with 2 pieces, but they were well stuffed with goat. It tasted a bit too salty, but the sauce balanced it out well. Also, the goat belly came with an extremely small portion, and the butter sauce did not pair that well with the dish. However, the goat belly was well cooked and soft. Lastly, we ordered the oysters and got to try all 3 different cooking styles for the oysters.

I've eaten here during previous visits and I must say the food seems even better than before. The flavors are fantastic and the atmosphere is great, albeit a bit loud.

Avid followers of Top Chef will recall Stephanie Izard immediately; she was the winner of Season 4 - the first female chef to achieve the title of \"Top Chef\". Since then, she's successfully opened Girl & The Goat, her most popular restaurant, as well as Little Goat, and published her first cookbook (Girl in The Kitchen) in 2011. Needless to say, our expectations going in were quite high.<br><br>Despite our reservation, we weren't seated until 10 or 15 minutes afterwards, which normally wouldn't have been an issue, but given the already late time, was made dramatically more painful. Regardless, we were promptly seated by our cheerful server, who gave us a quick overview of the menu, including the shared plates format as well as some highlighted dishes. After perusing the various section (split out between Vegetables, Fish, Meats, Bread, and of course Goat headers), we decided on five plates to share, which were brought out intermittently throughout our meal.<br><br>First to arrive was the Hamachi Crudo, a plate consisting of four slices of hamachi topped with a handful of diced crispy pork belly, a chili aioli, and a few pieces of thinly sliced, toasted bread. On paper, the dish sounded far more attractive than the actual taste. I missed a noticeable punch of acidity that should have accompanied the hamachi, and the pairing of pork belly and fish easily overwhelmed the latter. The sliced caperberries were a creative addition, but one that I failed to see the utility of, especially as it further served to mask the flavor of the hamachi. Thankfully, the Nantucket Bay Scallops were much more successful, as the sauteed scallops were paired with earthy beech mushrooms and a creamy french letil puree, followed by a slight lift with the celery root.<br><br>I'm grateful we added the Ham Frites to our order, as we were given a generous serving of thin fries which came with an accompanying Smoked Tomato Aioli, as well as a Cheddar Beer sauce. I would have appreciated a simple side of ketchup, though, as both sauces were rather heavy, especially in conjunction. It was a stark contrast to our final two dishes: first, the Roasted Duck Breast. The protein was cooked to an enviable medium, and topped with a garnish of rapini, peppers, and crispy rice noodles. The miso-marcona almond butter was relatively faint, although it did pair well with the sauteed onions and broccolini that formed the base of the dish. Less impressive was the Goat Belly confit, a dish that took a small portion of confited goat belly topped with an overzealous amount of sliced fennel and a nearly indistinguishable serving of lobster and crab. The goat belly was on the tougher side, and the already distinct gaminess clashed with the brininess of the shellfish.<br><br>In hindsight, perhaps my biggest complaint about Girl and The Goat, aside from dishes that scored across the board in terms of successfulness, was the relatively small portion size of each plate. Despite having five shared plates, we were still left wanting by the end of the meal... not a desirable outcome after spending nearly $100 on just the food. Perhaps I'm just biased, but I don't see why the restaurant has been met with such widespread acclaim; unfortunately, since it's also a lengthy plane ride away, I may never know.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DfTxBSqUar6W5DT6BUcAgw/348s.jpg", "caption": "Goat Belly"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9qcMvjBzrna6yUwPGvMf-A/168s.jpg", "caption": "Duck Breast"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XUmrqXT8xrbVBZXhD5N4iw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Ham Frites"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "This was easily the best meal I've ever had in my life.

Tip: Reserve a table beforehand because the place is pretty busy and packed. We were seated a little after 9:15 and our server explained how the servings worked. Great service. For 2 people, If you are an average eater, I'd recommend ordering 3 dishes plus one small plate and then go for the dessert in the end. Per our server's recommendation (which was in fact 5 main dishes for 2 people), we ended up ordering 3 main dishes with one small plate and a dessert to share but that came out to be a bit too much for us.<br><br>\"Olive you\" bread was delicious. Soft and crusty with olives in it and served with whipped feta and olive oil on the side. Whipped feta was so mouth watering there was no trace of it left in the end.<br><br>Main dishes: chickpea fritters - rich, dense with soft and creamy texture. Absolutely yummy. Not to be missed. The garam masala yogurt is delicious.<br><br>Next came in wood grilled broccoli. It was decent. Though not as good as chickpea fritters or the bread.<br><br>The last main dish was roasted cauliflower. It was a bit too salty to our liking and the peppers added more to it. Apparently this is one of the most liked dishes here but it just wasn't that for us. <br><br>The dessert we ordered was caramel corn and malt balls.

There are a handful of dishes I've had in my life that have stuck with me years after I've eaten them, and this has definitely been added to the list. Oh yeah, and the dessert was amazing too. Apple cake with your usual warm baking spices, crunchy candied almonds sort of like a brittle, and this ice cream - not knowing my Norwegian foods very well, I had to look up what gjetost was (it's a cheese) - this ice cream was savory and rich and sweet and had a bit of a dark sort of brulee'd flavor to it.

When we came in, we were seated immediately, but I did notice quite a lot of empty seats. I'm not sure if they were for walk-ins, but I still think that it was good that we had a reservation. The restaurant itself is huge and beautiful, and I loved the atmosphere of the place!<br><br>This restaurant serves food in small dishes, so for two people, the waitress recommended three to four plates. We ordered the roasted cauliflower, the confit goat belly, the pig face, and the grilled baby octopus. Before I get into the food, I have to admit that the service here was AMAZING. The waiters and waitresses were super attentive and catered to our every need! <br><br>Okay on to the food. The roasted cauliflower was SO GOOD. I wish I ordered two plates of that stuff! It was nice and smokey, and with the pine nuts and mint = DELICIOUS! The pig face was pretty good, but I don't really like the fatty-ish pieces of meat, so in retrospect I probably shouldn't have ordered this... The confit goat belly was delicious! The sauces that came with it were really interesting and I recommend that one. The only one I don't recommend is the grilled baby octopus. We were recommended this one by the waitress, and I thought the flavors were a little bit too strong altogether. It was little too salty, bitter, and while it wasn't bad, I just did not like it that much. <br><br>Overall, it's a great restaurant to check out in Chicago, and if I ever find myself in the Windy City again, I will make a trip here!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Tasty, tasty, tasty!

The standards are raised one notch and through all the hype it becomes difficult to manage. I will not lie in that I had major hopes for this restaurant as we even made reservations a month in advance. We were able to snag a 8:30 PM reservation for a party of six and made our way over in the freezing cold on Thursday night for dinner. The joint itself is very large and the décor is great providing a hipster vibe and not being too pretentious. We arrived and were greeted immediately by the hostess who told us it would take a few moments for our table to be set up. After our table was set, we were brought over and our server approached us immediately. She was super sweet and was very helpful in explaining all the menu items including providing her recommendations.<br><br>After perusing the menu for a bit we first decided on a few bottles of vino which is obviously always a great choice. We then started diving deep into the food and after a bit of thinking we decided to go with the honey sambal brioche, don't curry be happy, pan fried shisito peppers, roasted beets, wood grilled broccoli, chickpea fritter, Hamachi crudo, grilled baby octopus, ham frites, duck tongues, confit goat belly, sugo, and a few desserts. The breads were the first to come out and the honey sambal brioche was just solid. The honey butter was perfect with it and the bread was fluffy and delicious. The don't curry be happy bread was fine and good but nothing that really stood out in my mind. The shishito peppers were da BOMB. Yeah they were probably the best shishito peppers I have ever had with the right amount of spice complimented by the parmeasan. I could eat this dish alone for days. The roasted beet salad was surprisingly solid and I was a fan at how they brought in all the flavors together. The Broccoli was ok but personally I thought the smokiness was a bit too strong which drowned out all the other senses. The ham frites came out and these things were just killer also. Big fan of the tomato aioli sauce and the sprinkling of toppings on top was just perfect. We devoured these pretty quickly. The Hamachi crudo then came out and this sashimi paired perfectly with the pork belly. Again a well executed dish but for me nothing abnormal. The baby octopus was the next dish on the table and this dish was well executed. Delicious and the combination of flavors was perfect and the veggies were sautéed perfectly. The duck tongues were the next to join the table and obviously most of the folks at my table were a bit scared to try this... but this is pretty common dish I feel. I thoroughly enjoyed the flavors of this and the poke was the perfect pair to this dish. Again this is definitely executed well if you are able to get over the fact that you are eating tongue haha. Be adventurous yelpers!! The confit goat belly was tender and just solid all around. <br><br>This is not a pretentious place where they spend hours on plating they are looking to make good quality food and they are very good in this space. This place was solid and its unfortunate that were just a few dishes that did not jive with me but the ones that killed it were absolutely delicious. Still a great place to go and it is not overhyped by any means. Definitely a spot to try", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Baaaaaah to the goat.    <br><br>Condescending elitists that wasted my time.<br><br>While walking by here the name sounded familiar so I pulled up some reviews.  Walked in and looked at the menu.  While they were not open to the public for dinner door was unlocked, I walked in and they took my reservation in person right there inside the restaurant.  Told me that arriving early would be fine.  So went home, got dressed and excited.    Called to move the reservation up a bit and was told that is fine, come on by.  They rebooked to the earlier of three options.  Cool.<br><br>So we jumped on the pink line and were there in 20 minutes.  Not only did they give our reservations away (violating a verbal contact), the jack ass that told us we would now have to wait an hour at the bar was pompous and snotty.   He though it was funny to fuck up our plans with a smile obviously displaying that he enjoyed it.<br><br>To try to compromise we offered to shop in the area on foot and have them call us as we didn't want drinks or to hang out at the bar for an hour.   The snotty condescending jack ass smiled when he said \"we don't have time to call you.\"<br><br>In order to help others avoid this situation I'll probably book a good number of reservations where I may or may not be able to show up.  If they don't have time to call to confirm, what will they care?   <br><br>Future diners that get the tables I reserved, you are welcome.  And snotty self important man turning people away with personal glee and a grin, kiss my ass bro.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Stopped by on a Monday night without reservations, but we were able to get seated at 4:30 (opening) as long as we were out by 6 p.m. I was so happy they were able to accommodate us after hearing all the great things my friend had to say about this place (then I realized this is Stephanie Izard's place and I HAD to come). We were seated at a communal table, which was fine by me.<br><br>Before coming, I had done my research aka read through Yelp and knew what I wanted before we were even seated.

She asked if we were first timers and gave us a great run-down of the menu, which is always appreciated when you're new to a place.<br><br>La Paloma: I asked our server if this or the Local 75 was more sour and she pointed me to La Paloma. Loved it and it was definitely perfect for my tastes -- I like my cocktails sour and tart to the point that I can't taste the alcohol in it :P<br>Hamachi Crudo: Even though the pork belly was very good, I wasn't impressed by this dish. Hamachi and crispy pork belly make a surprisingly delicious combination, but this didn't live up to the \"hype\" of Girl and the Goat for me. I'd skip this dish unless you really love hamachi and/or pork belly.<br>Goat Carpaccio: We though since we were here, why not try some goat. The boyfriend and I both never had goat before this and thought we'd go all out with raw meat. Good dish, but nothing impressive.<br>Roasted Cauliflower: Almost every Yelp review mentioned this dish, so of course we had to get it. And finally, a dish that lived up to my expectations! This was my favorite dish of the night and I could've just eaten three orders of this and been happy. The mint, pine nuts, peppers were perfect with the roasted cauliflower -- such a unique, great combo. This is a MUST ORDER dish.<br>Pan Roasted Halibut: Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm not a big fan of fish, but this was SO good. The fish was a touch overcooked (dry =/) but the sauce fixed that problem. The menu says the fish comes/is cooked with a marcona almond butter and blueberry nuoc cham, which reminds me of a ponzu-y flavor but more sour and pungent.<br>Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face: The boyfriend was hesitant about this after I told him I wanted to try it. Days before we hit up Girl and the Goat, he goes on Google and reads about how the dish is made, which really does involve cooking the pig's face. When the dish came, that was all the could think about and could only eat so much. He was definitely overthinking it and weirding himself out, but I loved it. It has a taste that reminds me of teriyaki, but I can't quite put my finger on what food it reminds me off. But whatever. It's delicious. Order it.<br><br>While some dishes were underwhelming, the overall experience was great. Our water was constantly refilled and they switched out our dirty dishes three times.

I would've enjoyed this more if I wasn't stuffing my face with (7) - don't skip the list yet!<br><br>6) Goat medallions<br>2/5. I had this more than a year ago and it doesn't seem to be on the menu anymore (good). It was too rare for my liking and just pales in comparison to whatever else I was pigging on.

I would say one portion is good for a group of 4. Please don't deprive yourself by sharing this with too many people. I would NEVER go to Girl and the Goat and NOT order this. <br><br>8) Miso butterscotch budino<br>5/5. BACON TOFFEE. It was savory and sweet (both in the right amounts), and pretty unique!

The portion was generous and the meat was cooked perfectly. The green chutney-like sauce was a great accompaniment. <br><br>Goat empanadas: Loved 'em! The empanada crusts were cooked perfectly and the goat was super tender and flavorful. My only complaint is that there were only two empanadas, and I could've eaten at least eight, hehe. <br><br>Grilled baby octopus: I think we made a mistake by ordering two grilled dishes. The octopus was cooked alright (a bit too chewy) and the pistachios were a sassy innovative addition. The lemon vinaigrette was delicate and simple. The dish overall just didn't have much flavor. This was probably my least favorite of the night. <br><br>The Pig Face: ah, the Pig Face. It might've been because I was already stuffed and this dish came out last, but, the elusive, famous Pig Face disappointed me.

We tried the crudo, fries, pork, bruschetta calamari, cauliflower, bass, the chickpea fritters and goat empanadas. The highlights were the cauliflower- the best I have ever had. It was perfectly charred and was served with pine nuts, fresh mint, and peppers. The textures and flavors were unique and truly something that surprised the palate. I can only hope I can make a version of this dish. The chickpea fritters were a wonderful texture- a perfect crunch and a nice soft center. The peas and tomatoes accented the dish perfect. The crudo was good, but I have to say the quality of the fish wasn't up to my standard, it could have something to do with me living in San Francisco... where fresh seafood is abundant. The fries were just fries. The bass had a killer green curry sauce with a lot of citrus elements to it which I enjoyed immensely. The pork dish was a bit dry, and the ranch dressing did not go with the dish at all. I understand the thought behind the ranch, giving the dish a cool element from the spicy sauce (which was also on the side) but for me it doesn't work- this isn't buffalo wings. The goat empanadas didn't do anything for me. All and all a wonderful place! Definitely should check it out- it is a unique experience, especially for your taste buds.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_84g2BBmQvCqXsdIk6SJ5A/348s.jpg", "caption": "Pork- A bit dry."}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MM7cpBLi_XpCqlMCtwuLEw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Bass- Amazing Sauce!"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qGILQxXN0zIRMqCiwYH7gQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Calamari Bruschetta- So So"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "The girl and the goat has an amazing ambiance!

The beef cut like butter, and mixed with the citrus of the grapefruit along with the avocado and radish was INCREDIBLE!<br><br>After watching the guys in the kitchen churn out an untold number of the Pan Fried Shishito Peppers, I had to have them.

It was smoky, savory, and delicious with blue cheese and spiced crispies. Loved how the broccoli was totally infused with wood fired, smoky flavor! <br><br>As a surprise the kitchen presented us with grilled marinated pork belly. Wow! First, the cutting board presentation was phenomenal. The pork belly paired with green sauce and blood orange was amazing! I couldn't stop eating it!<br><br>For desert we had the plantain cake and miso-butterscotch budino. The plantain cake was great, but I would consider selling a kidney for another bite of the miso-butterscotch budino. It was like tasting the freedom of the beach for the first time as an adult.

I always order octopus if it's on a menu. So I am familiar with different tastes and textures. This octopus has got to be on my top 3. It was chopped up and sautéed with veggies and pistachios in a perfectly seasoned lemon sauce. It was perfection honestly. <br><br>Escargot Ravioli- was intrigued and excited to order this dish. It's original and never been done. We all know how to eat the garlic drenched escargot we have come to love but have you ever had it like this? Probably not...but you should! It was exactly what I envisioned...but I would call them dumplings rather than ravioli. The escargot were tender not chewy and had that earthy taste you either love or hate about them. I happen to love it. The miso based sauce was a perfect accompaniment! <br><br>Sagu- I appreciated this dish though it was not my favorite! I actually loved the pappardelle cut and the fact that you can taste its \"homemade\" pasta feel. It came with a mixture of goat and beef in a red sauce....that's all.<br><br>Pig face- I'm not a HUGE fan of pig. But I knew this was one of their signature dishes.

Fast-forward two hours and we were both extremely pleased! While we do not want to say this is \"the best restaurant ever\", we could not think of a better food experience! <br><br>Service - our service was very good! We asked a lot of questions and our server answered all of them spending quite a good bit of time with us (pre-food). <br><br>Food - Amazing!! We ordered 4 items (all made to share) and a dessert. We did not get a bread. I was on the fence as some reviews said you must try a bread. They look delicious, but we opted to save space for other items! We ordered the goat empanadas, crispy short ribs, the green beans and the pork shank. delicious!! the goat empanadas were my least favorite - however, they were very, very good! This speaks to the level of everything else in my opinion. The crispy shortribs were cubed, crispy and fell apart perfectly. This was a lighter dish, which you would not usually expect paired with avocado and grapefruit - excellent! The green beans (large portion) and the pork shank were my favorite!! I would get both again!! The sauce that comes with the pork shank I would buy by the bottle! The pork shank was extremely tender. We pulled the meat right off of the bone. We ended the evening with GATG's version of pineapple upside down cake. I'll admit I am a huge fan of pineapple upside down cake and not a huge fan of chocolate cake. I was not disappointed! The dessert was amazing!!!<br><br>I highly encourage everyone to book reservations today!

The food is delicious, creative, and locally inspired. <br><br>We went without a reservation, with a hope and dream that we could get in, and sure enough, we did. There was some magic to that...beyond what could be explained in a Yelp review.<br><br>The menu has a good variety of selection to meet whatever you're looking for - vegetables, vegetarian, vegan, paleo, unique, local. There are small plate options, so you can try several dishes without having to settle on one dish you want to try. There is a special \"goat\" menu, which didn't show prices on it when we were there. Regardless, we ordered the mysterious goat shoulder. We were warned that it was large, and we were confident (maybe overconfident) that we could eat all of it. We also ordered some other small plates with it - a beef tongue dish with chimichurri, some roast cauliflower, and a seafood dish. We enjoyed those dishes and then came the goat...which was basically a baby goat braised, on a platter, and served with several dipping sauce options. It was amazing. Melt in your mouth, and flavorful sauces to pair. It was also huge! We made a very small dent and then took the rest to go. <br><br>Though the price wasn't listed on the menu considering it was basically an entire small goat, the price shouldn't have surprised us. ~$90 for just the goat.

I had to see for myself what this venue had to offer. It was hard to schedule a table with only a few days to pick from, but not impossible. So far so good. They also let me change our party reservation from 2 to 3 at the eleventh hour. Good stuff. <br><br>The dining space was warm and well lit but very noisy and tight on space. We never got comfortable especially where leg room was concerned.  As soon as we were seated, water was poured and the waiter started to explain the tapas style menu. We asked about their recommendations and popular dishes, but with a revolving menu, it is plain to see what favourites have made a lasting impression on city diners.<br><br>APPETIZERS<br><br>We opted for the MUSHROOM BREAD variety and enjoyed the moist warm bread, and the tomato olive drizzle almost as much as the mushroom paste. Nothing extraordinary, but a great alternative to regular bread paniers. They recommended the hummus version but we went against the grain on this one, pun intended. <br><br>THE GOAT EMPANADAS were next up. These were slightly too salty but well dressed with a cream cheese onion and tomato garnish that dialed down the sel. Pretty good. <br><br>GOAT LIVER MOOSE- This was a popular dish. We ordered it later because we realized we had more room after our entrees, but I'm glad we did. The crumpets were warm and gooey, and the grilled orange-rines compot was my favorite spread. The pickled cawliflower and regular pickles were not a delectable match at all. The Goat Moose jam, was just a-okay.   Truthfully,  I could have eaten the biscuits on their own so this item is still worth the buy but not the fuss.<br><br>THE BABY OCTOPUS also failed in my eye. Greatly in fact. This new addition to the menu needs to be taken back to the drawing board. The shallots, beets, and bean salad was too acidic, though I liked their treatment of the green and white beans (blanched to perfection). The octopus had no taste, especially after our wonderful octopus treat at Carnivale the night before (see my full review).<br><br>ENTREES<br><br>THE BEEF CHEEKS are actually on the entree menu but the serving is so small, even for a tapas approach, that nearly marked it down as an appy. I really enjoyed the fun textures here- slippery beef, crunchy oniony stix, all swimming in a broth bath. This was one of my favorite dishes but I was the only one so satisfied. The rest of the table did not enjoy this plate at all.  <br><br>ESCARGOT RAVIOLI- The snail was tender and chewy, and well seasoned, but the sauce was, again, way too salty. We could barely finish this plate, small as it was.<br><br>Going by previous yelpers' enthusiasm, I knew I wouldn't leave without trying the infamous WOOD-ROASTED OPEN PIG FACE. As per usual, the waiters encouraged us to mash it all up for a full flavour explosion.  I did enjoy the combo of the fried eggs, potato stix and the barbecued meat, but this is nothing you couldn't pull off at home, and that says a lot about a dining experience. Bold creation, puttered execution.<br><br>DESSERT<br><br>MISO-BUTTERSCOTH BUDINO- When it came time for dessert, we had room for one and only one pick, to be shared three ways. We took Antonio's recommendation and gave the Budino a try.  I liked the marriage of bacon toffee and cashews, and the feel of foamy whip on candied pineapple, but I didn't get butterscotch in my spoonfuls.  It was a nice finish but didn't taste as good as it sounded or looked, a theme for the night I'd say.<br><br>Overall, the fusionistic approach to menu and meal creation is admirable, and service and staff give you a pleasurable dining experience , but most of the courses didn't impress us, and NONE impressed ALL of us.<br><br>Everything comes in a small portion and I can't help but think this is part of the marketing genius behind this restaurant cause we could not have eaten many bites of any of it. <br><br>I will add that this was a midway value given the number of courses we had and our $60 bottle of wine- three diners parted with $75 each after a handsome tip. Not bad. <br><br>At the end of the day, fancy titles don't mask what's really going on here. An interesting menu born out of a creative mind but not worth more than a free trial. Even the waiter had to admit the ''drip coffee'' was nothing more than coffee on marketing steroids. <br><br>I RECOMMEND: The empanadas to meat lovers and the breads and cheeses to vegetarians.<br><br>EXTRA TIP: Ask your waiter what's new on the menu since it changes, and stick to the old!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The family and I ate dinner here last night..

Everything else was new to me. <br><br>We started with the summer tom bread, which was not complimentary. It came with tomato oil and spring onion cream cheese, and I have to admit it was worth paying for. We also wolfed down the spring onion pot stickers and the goat empanadas. The pot stickers were pleasant, sweet and vegetal with ripe corn, rhubarb, dandelion greens, and sunflower seeds. The goat empanadas were a highlight of the meal, one of the best goat dishes I've come across in my admittedly limited goat-eating experience. The empanadas were crisped golden, and they came with a harmonious mix of grilled blueberries, miso-harissa aioli, and a farm veggie slaw. The goat was savory and flavorful but still quite easy to eat.<br><br>We moved on to some grilled kalbi beef ribs, a fancy restaurant rendition of classic Korean barbecue, served with sweet corn coblettes and a charred okra relish. The kalbi was tender and glazed thick with sauce, and the sides were interesting and very on point. Shifting to seafood, we had some wood-fired scallops and tempura soft shell crab. The scallops were silky and supple, and they came with sugar snap peas and a bacon currant chimichurri, all in an irresistible smoked uni cream sauce. The soft shell crab was also nice, though probably the least memorable dish of the night. It came with sweet corn elote and a shallot aioli.<br><br>The pan-roasted halibut might have been my favorite dish of our meal. The fish was perfectly cooked, moist and flaky and full of mild flavor. It came with Marcona almond buter, white asparagus, and a hauntingly delicious blueberry nuoc cham sauce. Dinner ended with the crisp braised pork shank, which was probably overkill. It was a huge portion of juicy pork, served with naan, buttermilk dressing, and stone fruit kimchi. It was impossible to finish, but certainly worth a strong effort.<br><br>We shared two desserts, one of which was comped for Tristan's birthday, presented with a candle. The first was the bittersweet chocolate with Thai basil-chocolate chip gelato and blackberries, an excellent chocolate dessert with an unusual mix of complementary flavors. The sticky date cake was even better, a sweet, addictive, dense little cake served with blueberry preserves and a side of MontAmore gelato. I was really into that light cheesy gelato.<br><br>We had a great time at Girl & the Goat, and I'd love to come back again on my next trip to Chicago.

The chefs were so nice and were more than happy to provide answers for any question that I had (including, but not limited to \"what are you doing,\" \"what's that,\" and \"did I order this?\").<br><br>We ordered the wood grilled broccoli (with rogue smokey bleu sauce and spiced crispies), goat liver mousse (served with watermelon salad, smoked pear mostarda and crumpets), and the wood oven roasted pig face (with sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantry, red wine-maple sauce and potato stix). We were also comped a plate of pan fried shishito peppers because our waitress felt that they would be a good compliment to our other dishes. And I also received a little complimentary dessert of the peach and blueberry crumble with honey graham cake and goat cheese gelato as Boyfriend had put down that it was my birthday as the special occasion :)<br><br>Gonna break it down by dish here, but for an early tl;dr -- IT WAS ALL AMAZING AND YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY GO IF YOU GET A CHANCE TO.<br><br>Wood grilled broccoli -- this was probably Boyfriend's favorite dish of the entire evening. He was IN LOVE. Normally, we're not big fans of bleu cheese, but the dressing on the grilled broccoli was light enough not to be overwhelming and perfectly complimented the grilled taste of the broccoli. This was an amazingly light appetizer that we inhaled.<br><br>Goat liver mousse -- I was honestly worried that this was going to be waaay too rich for me to enjoy (like the duck liver mousse I've had at State Bird Provisions -- too rich to finish), but it wasn't too rich at all! I mean, it's rich -- but not so much that you felt as though it were coating your throat and arteries as you swallowed. It was AMAZING when you spread it on the crumpets and topped it with the smoked pear mostarda, which cuts into the richness just enough that all the flavors blend together and take you away to heaven. Not even kidding.<br><br>Pan fried shishito peppers -- I was worried this dish would be spicy but it wasn't at all! The exterior is crispy and interior is tender, the peppers are perfectly pan fried and retain an incredible amount of flavor, perfectly complimented by the parmesan, sesame and miso. Seriously, I'm sitting here drooling as I'm thinking about it.<br><br>Wood oven roasted pig face -- hands down, probably the best part of the meal. It was so tender and flavorful and amazing. Not actually a pig's face looking back at you (I don't know why I thought this was the case, but I did), but think more like cabeza meat in Mexican dishes. What with the sunny side egg and the \"potato stix\" (a fancy way to say hash browns), it was like a super succulent breakfast dish.<br><br>Peach and blueberry crumble with honey graham cake and goat cheese gelato -- so glad I only got a taster dish of this as a birthday freebie. I never would've finished the full-size dish as I was already stuffed to the seams from the meal itself. This is a pretty rich dessert because of the gelato, but the crumble and cake help to cut it just enough that you're not overwhelmed.<br><br>Seriously, this is a 5-star place. Come hungry, leave happy. And, honestly, it doesn't really break the wallet for the quality of food that you're getting! If I ever visit Chicago again (and I will!!), I'm definitely make this a regular stop!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vtCo6f56OtL3xWVQlTjPJw/348s.jpg", "caption": "The only photo I took because I was too busy inhaling the food."}]}}, {"review": {"des": "I am stuck in a jam on this review.

The meat fell of the bone and went perfectly with the buffalo sauce, blue cheese, kimchee, and naan. All of the flavors come together in an amazing way.

Clean tasting not too briny maybe a tad overloaded with horse radish but I'll forgive the heavy handedness. <br><br>Dish two was the fried chickpea fritter. Unfortunate they called it a fritter because this is much more refined and nuanced that any old fried doughy thing you've had before. This is perfectly light and delicious--melts in your mouth. The bed of brussel sprouts and greens also compliment the fritters. <br><br>Next I had the escargot dumplings. The sauce was pretty freaking amazing. I only wish the dumplings had more texture ? The escargot was also not discernible for me ..<br><br>Finally ended with the infamous wood over roasted pig face. My Filipino kababayan will find this similar to a sisig but elevated in a pretty ridiculous way. Crispy, unctuous and perfectly porky if you must get one thing please get this. Though the tamarind sauce is good I wish it had a bit more acid. I also think the fried egg is extraneous ... Maybe if they served this on a hot plate sisig style and put a raw egg on top I'd appreciate the addition of the egg. <br><br>Finally ended with some tea and the chocolate truffle. Great dessert but not too out of the box or crazy inventive. <br><br>I had the pleasure of dining alone and my server Kristen was awesome.

The hostess kindly suggested stopping in early in the week and try for a walk in table which we did. We arrived about 5:45pm on a Tuesday and were offered immediate outdoor seating. We opted to wait for inside seating and after about 20 minutes we were able to snag seats at the bar.<br><br>Seating: Reserved seating is obviously the best, but there is also a good amount of first come, first served seating at the bar and you can also order food in the lounge area by the entrance. There are two additional pairs of bar style seating in the back at either end of the kitchen (I believe also first come, first served) that provide a great view of the chefs at work and a bit more privacy than the seats at the main bar. If I came without reservations again I'd go for these kitchen view seats!<br><br>Food:<br><br>Johnny Applecheese bread with chili-cheddar butter and malted oil: Our bread came out fresh and piping hot! My friend and I really liked the chili-cheddar butter, malted oil was whatevs. Recommended.<br><br>Wood oven roasted pig face with sunny side egg: A mix of crispy and soft textures, rich and flavorful. Sunny side egg is great on anything! Smaller portion. Would recommend this slightly above the pork shank for flavor and uniqueness.<br><br>Crisp braised pork shank with buttermilk dressing, butternut shiitake and naan bread: You get a lot of tender meat with this dish which literally falls right off the bone! Buttermilk dressing was a little bit like a raunch sauce (good). Naan bread was just perfect, warm and crispy with a soft inside. You'll definitely want to share this with 2-3 people. Recommended.<br><br>Roasted cauliflower: This was maybe the most surprising dish of the evening. The cauliflower was very well seasoned and had a nice peppery flavor. Very hearty and a surprisingly large portion, would also suggest sharing this with 2-3 people. Recommended.<br><br>Our service at the bar was good and we didn't have to wait long for each dish to come out.

The slaw it came with was great and provided a creamy texture that was just right<br>- Pan Roasted Halibut: One of my favorite dishes of the meal. The almond butter, soy, and mushrooms had a very unique flavor and texture that I had never tasted before.<br>- Confit Goat Belly: Delicious, and slightly leaner than pork belly.<br>- Wood Roasted Pig Face: My favorite dish. Pork cheeks were amazing, the potato sticks created a crispy texture, and the egg on top just made everything better.<br><br>Dessert:<br>- Miso Butterscotch Budino: I'm a big chocolate aficionado, but this was great. The creaminess and candied cashews were just unreal.<br>- Bittersweet Chocolate Brownie with Basil Ice Cream: One of the more unique desserts I've ever had. The basil wasn't too overpowering and went well with the bittersweet chocolate.<br><br>Service was great with recommendations, and the waiters were like ninjas with the water.

So it was the first time for 3 people in my group and the third time here for me. The evening started a little dicey.

No explanation, no offer to have a seat at the bar/lounge area because it may be a while and no suggestion to perhaps order a drink while we wait. Luckily, the food made up for the bad first impression. I started off with the ring of fire cocktail, which I enjoyed, but I didn't really think it was spicy at all. On to the dishes. We ordered the johnny apple cheese bread, pan fried shishito peppers, hamachi crudo, escargot ravioli, blackened catfish, crispy beef short ribs, crisp braised pork shank, confit goat belly and caramel corn & malt balls. This was the perfect amount of food for 4 people. We definitely were stuffed to the brim at the end of dinner, but didn't waste much. The johnny apple cheese bread was good, however, they don't provide enough bread to use up all the spread. The shishito peppers were nothing special. Hamachi crudo was really good and had nice contrasting textures.  The ravioli, catfish and short ribs were all good, but not amazing. The crisp braised pork shank was a very large portion and was very tender. I don't actually like goat, but the confit goat belly was very good, too. And how could you go wrong with any dessert with caramel corn?! I've always enjoyed Izard's use of different textures in her dishes and her use of acidity and tartness to cut through the heaviness of some meats.

We got there around 7:30 pm and were told a table wouldn't be available until 10:30 and we'd be better off trying to find a spot in the bar & lounge area. We waited 30-45 minutes before two finally left, and the three of us nabbed their spot. I ended up not having space at the table and had to eat off my lap... Nevertheless, the food was amazing.<br><br>I ordered a glass of Schloss Schönborn 2006 Estate Riesling Kabinett, and we started off with two breads, the Gouda Bacon and Busta Rye (both $4 each), and Ham Frites ($7). I preferred the first bread over the latter, since it was served with smoked fat back butter. However, I still like last year's Peter Piper bread better and was disappointed they didn't have it this time. The ham frites is simply fries served with ham bits and smoked tomato aioli and cheddar beer sauces.

The most overrated was definitely the hamachi and I wouldn't order it again; it was good, especially since it was served with pork belly, but it wasn't all that special. The pig face was just as good as I remembered it, if not better; however the winner of the night was probably the pork shank. Wow. Dressed in buttermilk and served with grilled spring onion kimchee and deliciously pillow-y naan, the meat was so tender and fell right off the bones. I'm salivating just thinking about it.

Absolutely amazing restaurant. We came in on a Friday afternoon at 5 and had no reservations but got seated right away with the sole condition that we give up our table after one and a half hour (seemed fair!). The restaurant has a nice hip ambiance with high wood framing, exposed dramatic ducting, big faux-stone accent walls and intimate lighting. Our waiter was great. We ordered the following:<br><br>Tapas:<br><br>The scallop: 5/5. Best scallop I've had. Particularly loved the juxtaposition of the tenderness of the scallop with the crunchy walnuts and charbroiled Brussels sprouts.<br><br>Goat empanadas: 4/5 warm and comforting. Perfect hint of gamey meat. Could use a kick of some kind.<br><br>Broccoli: 4/5. I love the smoked blue cheese complimenting the broccoli. It gives it mass. However while the stem of the broccoli was crunchy, the rest was rather soggy. Would have been a 5 otherwise.<br><br>The chicken: 5/5. WOW! It takes some serious skills to get a chicken to be that flavored and juicy. This bird was cooked with love....and I'm in love with it!<br><br>Goat belly: 3/5. The goat and lobster combination was daring. However, I felt like there was some cheating in this dish. A lot of the flavor relied on the fat grease taste. It was a little heavy for me.<br><br>Cocktails:<br><br>Best of Three: 3/5 Easy drink to start with. Nice, smooth and citrusy. Goes down fast.<br><br>The Innovator: 5/5 Nice and meaty. Definitely has character. Good Jim beam kick in the beginning with a soothing pear citrusy finish.<br><br>Beauty in the Dark: 5/5 Fun and slightly bubbly. Carries you on a high note throughout. Good to get your taste buds energized for the meal.<br><br>Rebirth of Honest: 4/5 Perfect drink to end the meal with. Nice balance between the bitters and the creme de cacao. Quite overpowering though. A dessert by itself. Wouldn't go well with another dessert dish.<br><br>Desert:<br><br>Doughnut holes: 5/5. I know doughnut holes are inherently delicious but, wow.....

On a Wednesday night my husband and I wanted a late dinner so we wandered over and were lucky enough to get a table. We had the chickpea fritters, escargot ravioli, and the pork shank. The pork shank was the obvious stand out of the meal. It's tender, HUGE, and comes with a ranch and a buffalo sauce, kind of like an XXL chicken wing (but so much better). <br><br>We recently went back and grabbed a seat in the bar area for drinks and snacks. We had the shishito peppers and ham frites. The frites were good, but pretty classic french fries. I only wish the beer sauce they came with resembled more of a beer cheese, but really it tasted like a lightly flavored aioli. Honestly the roasted tomato aioli that came with it was better. The shishitos, while very good, range in spice, so it's a bit of a Russian Roulette. I'm not one for a lot of spice so once I almost lost my tongue on one pepper, I called it quits, but my husband was happy to finish them off. They have a nice selection of wines and some really interesting cocktails--I was particularly impressed by a bubbly from New Mexico (I didn't even know they made wine). Really I can't imagine anyone doesn't want to come here, so you're probably reading Yelp to solidify your desire, to which I say, do it. It's worth trying at least once and you're sure to experience new flavors and maybe even find a new favorite dish.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This restaurant is superb. As of right now, I am the fullest I've ever been after a meal and it's because that even after my stomach was like, \"No, stop eating, I am full!\" my mouth was still like, \"GOTTA HAVE EVERYTHING.\" All of the food was sinfully good. On top of that, great service that was attentive throughout the meal even though the restaurant was quite big and had many diners in it. <br><br>My boyfriend and I came here mostly knowing what we wanted to try (because I had stalked Yelp endlessly after finally snagging a last minute reservation a few weeks back). We decided on Italian sausage bread with fennel butter and pickled spread (sad that the Applecheese bread was not there), green beans, the broccoli, the trout with clams and goat liver mousse, and of course, the pig face. <br><br>The bread: filled with delicious pieces of sausage, but I was not as into the butter and pickled spread as I thought I would be. However, the bread itself was so good that in the end I was glad that the butter was so mild because it allowed me to taste the meaty flavor of the bread. My boyfriend, who is really into bread, really enjoyed it as well.<br><br>Broccoli: SO, SO GOOD. The dish looked deceptively simple but we actually finished the whole plate! There is also a lot of broccoli, by the way. We kept trying to figure out how they made it so deliciously smoky, but we couldn't! The slight tanginess from the blue cheese and the rice krispies added flavor and texture depth. Delicious.<br><br>Trout: another winner! The fish was cooked PERFECTLY with crispy skin on one side. It fell apart when poked with a fork, and we mixed it with the mousse and clams and it was so creamy, yet not overpoweringly rich. Still super decadent though. I was so surprised at how well it meshed with the slight flavor of goat! Another great dish with flavor and texture depth.<br><br>Green beans: simple veggie dish, BUT SO DELICIOUS. I think I was surprised at how tangy the sauce was - you can definitely taste the fish sauce! The beans were also snappy, fresh and juicy so they were a delight to eat. Not sure why the cashews were included though - felt a bit out of place.<br><br>Pig face: favorite dish from the night! So rich and delicious - we polished it off in 10 minutes even though it was the last dish to arrive at the table. Ridiculously, sinfully good. ORDER IT.<br><br>Overall, amazing experience!

He's been here a couple of times and knew to make reservations for us on a Saturday night. We were seating almost immediately. It is quite dim and quite loud inside. I was fine with the noise because we were definitely having drinks at dinner and some inebriated bonding time. The restaurant has the feel of a fancier restaurant but also very personable and cozy. It's not pretentious and I liked that. <br><br>What we ordered in the order it was served:<br><br>Bacon gouda bread with butter and romesco - The bread is very tiny, only four slices, but very savory. The romesco was heavenly.<br><br>Goat carpaccio, trout roe, fried capers, olive-maple vinaigrette - Loved the combination of the thinly sliced goat with the vinaigrette dressed greens and fried capers. This plate is smaller and lighter than most on the menu.<br><br>Goat liver mousse, picked rhubarb, blueberry, crumpets - I loved this one even though I am not a big fan of liver. Cut the crumpets in half, spread some goat liver mousse, and top with either pickles of the blueberry spread. DE-LICIOUS.<br><br>Shishito peppers, parmesean, sesame, miso - I'm a big fan of shishito peppers especially when they make it like this at restaurants. However, I thought there was a tad too much parmesan and HOOOOLY SMOKES these were hot! I feel like the really spicy ones are one in a million but I got at least 5 in this little bowl of peppers. We didn't finish half of it because my mouth was on fire and I couldn't taste anything else after.<br><br>Halibut, almond butter, white asparagus & Cauliflower, pickled peppers, pine nuts, mint - These two paired very well together. Tactfully served, guys!<br><br>Pork shank, spring onion kimchee, buttermilk dressing, naan - At this point, my stomach was about to pop. The pork was very tender and went well with everything else. I wish I had more room to eat a couple more bites!!<br><br>It's recommended 2 plate per person. We went with 7 total because the bread and the carpaccio were on the smaller side. The three of us also shared two bottles of white wine (one very acidic one and another Greek wine I really enjoyed). Our server was great and contributed to such an enjoyable dinner atmosphere. He made it a point to get to know us and gave us spot-on recommendations!<br><br>Girl & The Goat is a must try in Chicago, but don't forget to call ahead!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/W5ixq03DoX65-u8fevEkXg/348s.jpg", "caption": "Super cute goat"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mW01OhyLGXFxa1t3WTz7jA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Pork shank, kimchee green onions, buttermilk dressing, naan"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WKOUAJERUOW3i1X9GTpm1A/168s.jpg", "caption": "Cauliflower"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Absolutely adored this place.

It was super loud and noisy though, expect that, but they played some super cool 90s throwbacks, which I heard when the place finally started to die down around 10:30pm & it's totally worth the loud noise. They have an awesome wine menu and I was happily taken aback that our waitress, Danielle, knew every single bottle from top to bottom. A+ right there! She also knew the menu really well and was eager to give suggestions on what we should order and what not to order. <br><br>We started out with the ham frites, which came out right away.

You see, I had originally made reservations for G&G back in 2010 for March 30th, 2011. My reservation was later cancelled for an unknown private event that they were hosting on that date after my reservation had been taken only by mistake. I worked at a restaurant at the time and though I felt a little sour, I understand how mistakes can happen. Plus I drove by on the night of my B-Day last and found out that the secret private event was the Top Chef finale.... Okay fine, I guess that might be a little more high profile than little ole me... and it only took another year before it all ended up working out. <br><br>Yesterday I was treated to one of the nicest dining experiences I've had in a long time (Thx, Mark S!). Coming from a serving/bartending background, I always appreciate when servers look comfortable at work- ie, super cute goat guy on a thin black tee and jeans. They basically had me at their uniforms, which are pretty damn similar to my everyday attire of a bunch of stuff with animals on it, and nothing to fancy schmancy. <br><br>The food on the other hand... a little more dressed up. Like, I thought I looked nice until I saw what my dinner was wearing. Our server said that for 2 people 4-5 plates is usually plenty... so naturally, we went with 6... and a dessert. Here's the birthday run down:<br><br>- Fresh baked bread with coffee spread = whoa. Whoa-ho-ho. Unbelievable. Eating this reminded me of Halloween time and seeing one of your friends in a costume where you might see them everyday in regular life but in costume they're barely recognizable... and they look so good you can't stop staring and creep them out. It's like that. How could this taste so much like coffee and not like bread or artificial coffee flavoring and why can't I take my mouth of it? And then I start creeping out other diners with my enthusiasm for eating it. By far, my favorite item of the night... and I don't really even like bread. <br><br>- Fresh baked maize bread with avocado yogurt... Daaamn is all you need to know. <br><br>- The famous cauliflower: Parm cheezy and delish. I preferred the bottom bits without the cheese and with the mint leaves, but my cauliflower hatin' counterpart LOVED the cheese and scarfed his portion down and then some with jubilant fervor. <br><br>- Warm marinated olives. Whodathunk olives would taste even better warm? I guess they work on the same level as salted nuts. You MUST get an order of these bad boys to munch on throughout your meal. Plus, a million of them come in an order so it's a nice little time sucker... and they don't forget to provide you with a little pot for the pits so you don't end up with a plate full of spitty, gnawed on pits. <br><br>- Roasted beet salad with crunchy-ness and green bean biz-nast. Okay, obvi that's not what it was actually called but I've been working a lot and sleeping a little so my mind was in a bit of a daze but what I liked about this beet salad, as the world's biggest beet fan, is that it wasn't a bunch of mixed greens with a few beet bits- it was 100% Beet by volume and only had a light sprinkling of mixed greens on top for color. Just beet it? Don't mind if I do. <br><br>- Artichoke... something? I dunno. I just glanced at the menu quickly and when I saw olives, beets, and artichokes (3 of my top 5 favorite foods) I know which plates would be called upon. If I had to describe the artichoke dish I'd say it was like a pasta that looked like individually wrapped candy packets filled with nutty goodness. Hehe... she said 'nutty goodness.'<br><br>To be honest, I didn't really read the full description of anything I ordered. There was so much going on as far as atmosphere and the best playlist ever! Seriously, I think I looked around and at some point in the night, I'm pretty sure every person in there had uttered the word's 'it's like I made this playlist\"... sure you did, buddy. I was thinking the same thing about myself and then while I was looking around I realized that though I LOVED every song, I'm just not nearly cool enough to be able to devise a playlist of that magnitude. It was a scene alright, but still cool enough that you can pull a mix of really dressed up people to really casual peeps and still have everyone feeling comfortable. Then again, it's dark and loud as f*ck so everyone seems about the same level when you've got those two things going. <br><br>And I probably don't have to mention this but I will anyway- the beer list was quality, my Tequila Fleur got my kulo buzzed, and our server was a God damned peach if I've ever seen one. <br><br>It would take a plague of epic proportions to keep this (now 1 year older) Miss away from G&theG for too long.

I'd like to chalk it up to a combination of mishaps and a bad server, but regardless my evening was a massive disappointment based on all the hype. Myself and my family made this reservation months in advance to celebrate a combination of an anniversary and a birthday, which we had even indicated with our reservation. Needless to say, we went preparing to spend a lot of time and money enjoying ourselves and the restaurant but we did not get that opportunity.<br><br>We were somewhat awkwardly greeted by our server Alex upon our arrival. We needed a few minutes to peruse the menu of course, but when we told her the plates we had picked out, she was quick to ask if that would be enough. I said, \"Why don't we just start with that for round one?\" to which she insisted we tell her what we're considering and that some of our choices would be too similar, then suggested significantly more expensive plates in their stead. We felt incredibly pressured to choose our entire dinner while she impatiently stared at us, so unfortunately, we did. We ordered the green beans, the fried oysters, the pig face, the hamachi crudo, and the goat belly (on special that evening). As our ordering went on, Alex took on a more and more disdainful look and could not have turned on her heel faster once we were done ordering. At this point her attitude already put a horrible taste in our mouths, no pun intended.<br><br>From then on, the food experience itself just sputtered. The green beans came out first, which I thought was a strange choice - while good and full of umami flavor, at the end of the day, they are simply green beans - why bring those with no protein on the table? Shortly thereafter the oysters arrived at our table - four TINY morsels with as much breading as oyster, with one fried caper on each, nestled into a massive bed of what I can only call potato salad. It seriously tasted like supermarket potato salad - no contrast or pop at all - and it completely overwhelmed the oyster. My parents were kind enough to let me have at the extra oyster and the only way to enjoy it was to pull it out of its gloppy potato nest, pry off some of the breading, and get about one second of enjoyment out of what should have been the star. So disappointing.<br><br>I don't think I'd even gotten to the fourth oyster when the pig face was arriving on the table (we are talking the third dish arriving in about five or six minutes since the first). My stepdad had asked for an extra egg which turned out to be a great idea - pro-tip! - because the runny yolk absolutely helps bind the dish together. The pig itself is so fatty and delectable, especially with the maple pairing, that it's not hard to see why this dish is a favorite here. However, based on the description I was really hoping for a pop of the tamarind or cilantro but both were woefully lacking as evidenced by how thinly their sauces were distributed on the plate. Maybe they were overwhelmed by the potato \"stix\", I'm not sure.... But without one of these flavors to set it off, I can really only call the pig face an above average hash.<br><br>Again, while we were not even halfway through this dish came the hamachi crudo, which flavor-wise was the real triumph of the night, though yet again, suffered from what I think was a real issue in proportioning. It came with caper berries, pork belly, micro herbs, and a fantastic chili aioli (though this sauce had no heat whatsoever). The hamachi was of GORGEOUS quality and the accompaniments were well chosen, but simply so sparse in comparison to the amount of fish. The caper berries were already tiny, yet had to be sliced into slivers for all of us to be able to taste them properly in conjunction with the fish and aioli. The pork belly pieces could not have been even a half inch long and there were three on the plate, so again, they had to be cut as small as possible.<br><br>And yet again, while we were still enjoying what had so far been our favorite, the goat belly made its way out to the table, which was by far the richest dish and a worthy way to end the night. While the portion is VERY small (the three of us had about a bite and half each, if that), the flavors are super heavy and indulgent -  tender confit goat belly, lobster, bourbon butter, and just enough greens to lighten it up... Slight recovery. But as soon as it was done Alex was coming around to ask if we wanted anything else (we didn't) and then hastily brought us the check. Keep in mind we had not even been in the restaurant for 45 minutes at this point - I hadn't even finished my tiny cocktail. Then after the check had already been dropped off she came with a small plate of dessert and the most awkward, \"Happy... happy day\" and fake smile I've ever had to endure. I don't know what we did to earn her disdain but it just capped off a poorly spaced and plated experience.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I happened to have a meeting in the area and thought, why not.

The cheese was subtle and the salad fresh and flavorful. Wouldn't order again though.<br><br>The tortone was house made sourdough with cream cheese and pepita spread. It was solid but it was nothing compared to the onion bread dish which is a brioche bread. It is crispy on the outside kind of like a muffin and combined with the butter and sweet chutney, it was one of my favorites.<br><br>We got the escargot ravioli. And for 15 dollars you only get 4 ravioli which is kind of a bummer. The snails were tender with a nice light chew, and the bacon sauce with wonton crisps on top provided a savory crunch.<br><br>Next came the infamous pig face which was truly like bacon on steroids as another yelper mentioned. It was thicker, softer and more tender than my normal bacon experience. With the egg on top mixed in, it was a winner.<br><br>Final main course dish was the duck tongue. The tongue was cut and fried into small pieces. Each bit was light airy and fried perfectly.

Girl & the Goat of course did not disappoint. <br><br>We were able to get in the bar area around 9 on Friday and ordered from a small but delicious and diverse cocktail menu. Although they were unable to make me a gin egg white cocktail, which I was dying for I ordered a Thai one on which was an incredible and sweet rum and brandy drink that packed a serious punch. I enjoyed every solitary sip of this cocktail and my friends seemed to be enjoying their as well. <br><br>When we were seated we went through the menu and had to narrow down our choices. The menu is large and diverse and full of delicious sounding items. We picked a bread, an oyster, two veggies, two fish dishes, two meats and a goat dish. I was pumped.<br><br>The johnny applecheese bread was served first with a cheese butter and malt vinegar and arrived warm and fresh to the table. I would lick the cheese out of the dish and order two more loaves of bread. Off to an amazing start. <br><br>Next our oysters arrived, they were fresh tasting and my friends liked them a lot but I just didn't enjoy that they were warm. I would however, absolutely try the other varieties they offer. <br><br>Here is the real sad thing about Girl & the Goat, the veggie dishes are so insanely good that when you finish them and get to the meat dishes, even though you are absolutely stuffed you still want more of that insanely delicious cauliflower. That is a standard and if you don't get it there is something wrong with you. We also had the goat cheese pierogies. Rich and delicious and holy crap yummy. <br><br>Next came the fish dishes. Grilled baby octopus and calamari bruschetta. The octopus had a great cook and rich flavors. The calamari bruschetta was nuts, at this point I was so drunk from yet another strong drink I was enjoying but I can surely remember that the presentation was great and the flavors spot on - a highlight. <br><br>After that we did a \"dual of tongues\" by ordering both the beef and duck tongue dishes. The duck was interesting, cut in strips and fried and the tuna in the dish was spot on, would absolutely order again. The beef tongue I remember being good, but I also can't really remember it, so let's just say it was the miss of the evening.<br><br>Our last savory was the goat belly. I can't even start with this dish. The fat from the belly and then it is literally SWIMMING in a crab, lobster, fennel butter sauce. I would sop this up with that cheese bread and then I would die and go straight to Heaven and BEG for a stair master. Literally one of the most delicious dishes in the entire city of Chicago and I have had some things. <br><br>For our last course we ordered both the pb&j and the seasonal apple dessert. I am telling you, run to get that apple dessert. I ordered a sauterne to go with it and it was the icing on a perfect birthday dinner. oh, and the pb&j was delectable as well. The wait staff is also friendly and the service is prompt. These dishes were a ton of food but also a great amount for a table of 5 people and all and all when split that many ways is a great price.

Maybe I don't like eating fat as much as most people here on Yelp). I just can't eat fat. And pig face had a lot of fat. A lot. <br><br>Crisp braised pork shank - this was also very good. Crispy on the outside. Meat just falls of the bone. Came with two sauces, kimchee, and naan. I wish it came out earlier cuz we didn't do it justice.

Their presentation and the taste was amazing. There were four choices and we tried all of them. My favorite was the chocolate mousse. <br>The servers are extremely nice to you, which is awesome. They're very helpful with everything. For example, it was our first time there and we didn't know what to get and he told us which ones are the best ones. He always provided his recommendations. After we ordered our foods, our server brought us olive oil and bread, they were so delicious. Moreover, the service was really fast, I liked how the foods came really fast.<br>I highly recommend everyone to go there. The atmosphere, food, and service are amazing. By the way, we made a reservation a week before we went there because the restaurant is usually packed and it is really hard to find seats without a reservation. Just don't forget to make a reservation before you go, and the price range is from $15 to $30. It can be a very salty check if you go just by yourself or with someone else.

The kimichi sauce was not spicy at all but very flavorful to dip the naan wrapped pork. 4. lamb belly with crab and lobster, the lamb was just melted in your mouth and it was balanced with a refreshing fennel flavor. Thought this could be a heavy dish but not at all, it just felt like a seafood dish on the rich side.

Our server, Hunter, didn't mind at all.  In fact he encouraged it. The dining experience is mainly tapas (small plates), meant to be shared and enjoyed over time. It is best to start with the lighter fare, and to work your way up to the heartier, meatier dishes. We did just that. <br><br>Our starters were the pan fried Shishito peppers, served with parmesan, sesame and miso and the \"Corny Goat,\" which is French bread served with goat cheese butter and corn relish. Next was the grilled baby octopus, which included guanciale, favas, radish pods, pistachios, and lemon vinaigrette and cofit goat belly, served with bourbon butter, lobster 'n crab, and fennel. So far, so good. We were off to a fine start, and I was already starting to feel satisfied, yet edging towards full. <br><br>Now comes the heavy lifting. We opted for the wood oven roasted pig face, served with a sunny-side egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine maple, and potato sticks. It was tender and flavorful. We also opted for the Pinn Oaks lamb tartare, prepared with sweet corn tapenade, tuna aioli, and water crackers. Although I was on the brink of exploding, I was extremely satisfied and felt very content. I sat back in my chair, closed my eyes, and savored every last bite. To finish our meal, we decided upon the miso-butterscotch budino: bacon toffee, glazed pineapple, and candied cashews, as well as the milk chocolate and galangal napoleon, served with blackberries and passion fruit.<br><br>Throughout our meal, we tried a variety of different drinks: \"Blood and Goats,\" a concoction of Monkey Shoulder Scotch, Leopold Tart Cherry, Savannah Madeira, and orange; \"The Lake Effect:\" Journeyman Rye, FEW Gin, Chrysanthemum Honey Liqueur, and lemon; and \"The Foghorn:\" also FEW Gin, Cocchi Vermouth, Luxardo cherries, and orange bitters. <br><br>My two-month wait time for a reservation was well worth it.  There are so many more places to explore and eat in Chicago that I believe I would be perfectly content finding a new spot, every night for one year.

I swear I don't do that...<br><br>Servers were beyond friendly, helping us out, stating it is family style, and an enjoyable experience. We did not have any dishes with goat in it, but we had quite the plentiful array of food. Started with a simple multi-grain bread, but it came with a very tasty cream cheese type spread, which if I had it my way, I would slather all over other things like... more bread or a bagel. Next was the grilled ramp marinated shrimp, grilled baby octopus, which were just all-around delights.  The octopus had the grilled crust and flavor, but nice and chewy in a lemon vinaigrette with pistachios and other little tidbits that kind of got lost.  The shrimp was perfectly cooked, but since I enjoyed the octopus so much I forgot what the shrimp came with other than a slight kick.  I love me some pork belly, so I was excited for their take on it.  I was sadly disappointed with it.  It was really good, but it didn't wow me.  It was different with some kind of green sauce (avocado and cilantro puree? that wasn't very flavorful), and some blackberries.  The skin was crispy but the pork meat of it was a little overcooked rather than melt in your mouth. If you like pork belly, I would still consider ordering it.<br><br>But the next two dishes were probably the most popular among all patrons because it seemed like I saw them bring out these dishes every few minutes.  My wife loves green beans, so if it's on any menu we usually order them, and they were really good!  Simple, yet very plentiful so I can see why so many order it.  The menu says sauteed, but there were some grill marks or some blackening on the tender beans that were cooked in a fish sauce vinaigrette and cashews.  I have to experiment to make this for us, it was that good!  Not overly salty since it was fish sauce, it made for a nice side dish.  But my favorite dish was the wood oven roasted pig face.  What the what?  No, it's not lord of the flies kind of thing.  It was beautiful!  My wife makes fun of me when I say you can make any dish good if you put a fried egg on it, but this really made the dish THAT much better! Big plate, loads of crispy pig face goodness with a tamarind sauce, cilantro, red wine maple sauce, and potato stix.  Just cut that sexy egg yolk and let the music begin!  The egg adds a richness to go with everything and just made me a happy camper.<br><br>We finished our meal with the miso-butterscotch budino with bacon toffe, glazed pineapple and candied cashews.  It was like a creme brulee, which really doesn't give it justice.  It was slap yo mama good!

I booked probably 2 months ahead, and got a time near their dinner opening on Friday night. At around 4:15 (opening time is 4:30), I saw that they already had people lined up outside who were hoping to get seats without having a reservation. It looked like they were successful, so if you don't have a reservation, I recommend you go during non-peak hours for sure. <br><br>The food was awesome. I love how they crafted their menu items to be moderately-sized dishes (for the most part) that you share with the rest of your group. This lets you sample quite a few things on their menu. <br><br>Our waiter told us to not forget the veggies, as their veggie dishes are really excellent. We tried to get the chickpea fritters,  it were told that the tasting of that dish that happened at 4 pm before the restaurant opened pushed the timing of the dish back such that it wouldn't be ready until 9 pm that evening, or perhaps not at all. I thought that was a pretty good move for the restaurant, not wanting to serve a dish that they didn't think was perfect. We ended up getting the roasted cauliflower -- and whoa, I have never been impressed with cauliflower before in my life until that dish came out! <br><br>We heard good things about the wood oven roasted pig face, which ended up being pretty good, although very heavy. I would have liked a little more of the tamarind or perhaps something more citrus-y to cut through the heaviness. Although the dish was not large, I felt very full even just after a few bites. Our waiter came by and mixed the dish up for us when he say they we weren't doing so enough, which was also nice. <br><br>Finally, we got the goat neck, which we were told ahead of time was a large dish so we didn't need to order much more after that. That was definitely a correct statement -- I never though goat necks were that big! But it was a really good part of the goat which I had not tried before. The meat was super tender, and just came right off with your fork. They prepare the near over a multi-day period and it comes out super rich, a little smokey, but not at all dry. The flavor is excellent, and the sauces paired with it are awesome as well. The vegetables on the bottom kind of got lost with the huge goat neck on top of it, and I would have liked a few more veggies in general. We ended up having to take some goat neck back home with us, and we left with several suggestions from our waiter about awesome goat neck leftover dishes. <br><br>Overall, an excellent experience. It seems like their menu changes pretty frequently, because a lot of the dishes mentioned in other posts were not on the menu when we were there.

This place is extremely busy and for good reason, the food was outstanding! (I'll get to that in a minute). If you only have a small group I would recommend walking in sometime around 6 PM and asking for a table. You will likely be told that there is a 1.5 to 2+ hour wait which is to be expected, however the actual wait time based on my experience and some other locals I had spoken with was considerably less (half the estimate). In addition, the planed wait time will allow you to walk right across the street to the Highly reviewed Lonely Wolf Bar to sit down and Sample some of their excellent cocktails while you wait.  Don't worry, Girl & the Goat will text you when your table is ready and your blood alcohol levels will be pre-primed for the experience!<br><br>Now onto the important part, the food...<br><br>Because I was dining alone (I cleverly evaded my colleagues' typical business trip steak dinners) I decided to splurge on three of their top-rated dishes. Each one of them was unique, complex, and beyond impressive.  Here are my thoughts on each:<br><br>Wood Oven Roasted Pigs Face:.<br><br>Even during my preliminary research the thought of pigs face in a dish admitting only made my stomach turn. I have been to many pig roasts and I'm not a freak that generally eats the face and eyes the roasted pig (although I will grab at the rest of the pig like a crazed zombie).  This dish easily surfaced as my favorite throughout my meal. As you can see in the countless photos on yelp the pig faces is served topped with a fried egg. The flavor of the warm yoke blends with the fat in the slice of pork so well I having trouble putting it into words... Add tamarind, cilantro, and red wine-maple;  It was heavenly.  Just order it.  No more questions please.<br><br>Pan Roasted Halibut:<br><br>The halibut was outstanding, initially slightly salty and quickly transitioned into spicy and sweet with marcona almond butter, white asparagus, blueberry nuoc cham, The ginger,and the mushrooms just added to the variety. It was incredibly complex and delicious. I would order this again in a heartbeat.  <br><br>Grilled Baby Octopus:<br><br>The baby octopus dish was served with fava beans, pea, pistachios and a lemon vinaigrette.  I LOVED the use of the fava beans In this dish. I have ordered octopus countless times over the years in many countries and this was easily the most unique presentation I have encountered. Very good.<br><br>If I could add a + to the end of my 5 stars I would.  A meal like this in New York City would easily have cost double the price. Follow my advice, walk in, reserve a table, and go get drinks across the street while you wait for a text message.

The cauliflower was also extremely good, with great flavor and a little spice. The goat belly was tasty, with a sweet flavor and good texture. It was interesting paired with the lobster meat, I wouldn't have thought those two proteins would go together, but it worked. The lamb ribs were more disappointing.

In debating ratings, hubby and I agreed on a 5 because we simply could not think of a single dish that was anything less than excellent. The blueberry jam with the bread was rich, the bread itself having the right amount of butter. The green beans have ruined me for green beans ever again, with their delightful cashews and savory sauce. The chicken had just the right amount of smoked flavor to reflect a wood fired approach without being too smoky, and the halibut was polished off in seconds flat by my other half. We also loved the Pierogis and the service was on point (helpful without being obtrusive and with great (and enthusiastic) explanations of every dish).

Completely overpowering. <br><br>I also got a bad oyster. <br><br>If a friend asked me to go again, I'd go, but I certainly wouldn't encourage it. <br><br>Service was excellent and the music was good.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "After missing out on dining here last year for my bday I was lucky to get a reservation this time around. Our experience was very positive, the tables were all occupied but it didn't feel stuffed like some places get. The decor was nice as well, it was modern without being pretentious. The lighting was dimmed but reasonably and the tables are well lit so you have no trouble seeing the menu or food as with some establishments. The staff was great, they knew the menu and did an excellent job describing and recommending from the selection.<br><br>We started off with a couple breads that were nice and warm, one of which had a mushroom butter that melted wonderfully. Next we had the hamachi crudo with crispy pork belly, pan fried shishito peppers, and the kusshi oysters. The crudo was fresh and went well with the pork belly, and the peppers while not spicy had a nice smokey flavor that married perfectly with parmesan. The oysters weren't bad but I couldn't taste what it was served with, possibly due to the smokey peppers I had just eaten. Next up was the wood oven roasted pig face and the lamb ribs. I like how the pork, egg, and potato stix all come together when mixing it all up. The crunchiness, soft egg, and savory flavor made for a nice combination. The lamb ribs were very tender and moist, and the fat wasn't excessive or off-putting which can happen with some lamb rib dishes. <br><br>The sauteed green beans with fish sauce vinaigrette was cooked perfectly with the perfect amount of sauce, not to mention served in a hefty portion for sharing. What I thought was excellent was the buffalo stye pork shank, it was one of the few dishes I've had that attempted to capitalize on the popularity of 'buffalo style' and successfully hit the mark. The naan was soft, sauce was flavorful and not overbearing, and the pork had the fried texture you would expect without becoming too dry. Our server was nice enough to tear the shank apart for us too for easy sharing. Our final dish was the confit goat belly with bourbon butter and lobster and crab. We liked the taste but honestly expected a larger portion. The goat belly seemed more like typical goat meat than belly, but having never had goat belly our expectations were based on pork belly. <br><br>We finished things off with two desserts and two cheeses, and our server was kind enough to bring an extra dessert with a lit candle after my mom spilled the beans about it being my birthday. The cheeses were Kunik-Pasteurized Goat and Dunbarton Blue-Raw Cow, the blue was really mild with few veins. I highly recommend any of their cocktails, each of us ordered something different and they were all worthy of repeating. <br><br>Apart from the difficulty of getting a reservation and the limited portions of some dishes I found Girl and the Goat to be a definite hit. If you're willing to gamble on a walk-in and have the ability of doing something else to kill the time I overheard someone with a 90 minute wait.

Great music and ambiance, and even better service from behind the bar!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "We have been here countless times, and each time I love this restaurant more and more! I cannot begin to tell about each experience or plate we have had so many. We have had intimate two person dinners, family dinners and birthday parties.  We feel we know some of the wait staff who have been around since the opening and it's always funny to have that recognition when dinning. Their wait staff has always been insightful in explaining any changes to the menu and making recommendations. I also like how they stagger the dishes and time them perfectly throughout the experience. They have a food service system that works despite the obvious, they are always slammed. <br><br>Over our visits a few of the dishes had remained on the menu, they are just so good! My overall favorite I get every time are the Sautéed Green Beans! I just cannot get enough of the warm beans marinated in the flavorful fish sauce. I also recommend the Shishito Peppers and the Chickpea Fitters. They are fun dishes to share with the table (or keep for yourself!). <br> <br>My boyfriend and I usually stick to the fish dishes on the menu because he does not eat meat. As these change all the time I cannot specifically list the best here. However, we have never had a dish we did not like. I do eat meat, however, and feel it a duty to try some of Stephanie's interesting meat creations. I have tried the pig face (pig cheeks) and a pork belly dish. As expected, no complaints from me!<br><br>Depending on how hungry we are we always try at least one of the bread and butter pairings, many times we cannot make up our mind and just get all three. <br><br>On to dessert, just order dessert! I had one of the best desserts I've ever had at G&G. It has been on the menu twice and if it ever reappears, get it! (a dark flowerless chocolate brownie with caramel and topped with shitake mushroom gelato (yes shitake mushroom). The flavors worked so well together it was amazing). I asked for this dessert once when it was off the menu and the staff checked in the back and at least brought me some leftover shitake gelato.  Score!<br><br>Last, G&G also has a knowledgeable revolving beer menu for the craft beer geek in our group and a nice wine list for the more refined. Make reservations in advance or take a chance to find a seat at the bar. I've never seen the restaurant empty or with room to move around. The smells and dark wood create a warm welcoming atmosphere that's laid back but still remains a part of the go-to-be-scene crowd.

We had asked the waiter if we could do a half portion of anything since some people on Yelp had done that. He said they only do that for single diners but after our first course he said he had spoken to the chef and he was sending a half portion of the cauliflower out to us on the house. Very nice touch but again it was pretty salty. We also ordered the halibut (good but small portion for the price), pig face (pretty tasty but kind of salty), and the goat loin.

Sauce is different but good and the peanuts were good addition as well <br>- Wood oven roasted pig face - okay, you cannot come here and not get this. I admit, this scared me, but this is one of their most popular items so we couldn't resist. And I tell you, it was amazing! Chop it all up and mix together and every bite is a treat! Very clever ingredients in there and a must-try. <br>- Goat empanadas- this was more delicious than I had thought! Happened to be my second favorite dish! <br>- Braised Pork Shank - amazing and HUGE... we still ate it all.. <br>- Pan roasted seabass. light and amazing!<br><br>Due to the generous portion sizes, this was enough food but also gave us a good range of the menu to try, so I was satisfied.

Afterwards came the calamari, which was also great. Personally, I thought the calamari by itself was just okay, but when you ate it with the bread that it came with, it was elevated to a whole new level. We rounded out the savory foods with the pig face. The pig face is one of the classic dishes here and it lived up to the hype. The savory flavors along with the mixture of soft and crispy textures was a perfect match. Dinner ended with the dark matter pot de creme, which was by far the weakest dish of the night.

I liked them. Were they what I expected of a place getting national buzz? Not really. Our group was split on opinions of the fried pickles, the pig face was fun (because it's fun to say pig face). The kalbi was fairly fatty and oily - I know these are part of why it's not a prime cut, but the portion we got didn't seem like it was cooked at the level of the rest of our dishes.  Sorry I don't have more details; on our brief trip to Chicago we ate very well, and I have to say none of the dishes here stuck in my mind in the days afterward.<br><br>Our waiter was nice and went along with our people-from-out-of-town schtick. However, I think there are some serious issues with their allergy menu philosophy. The gluten-free menu was a version of the regular menu with a bunch of asterisks that basically mean they have gluten in them (took a few trips to the kitchen to figure it out). Might be fine for people with a mild sensitivity, but it's depressing to see a majority of dishes have malt vinegar and soy sauce on a gluten free menu (both are solidly not gluten free). It seems clear they did their gluten free menu as a sop to fad dieters and not to serve people with actual dietary needs, and have not trained the staff on food allergens. On the plus side, the gluten free bread they brought out was good.<br><br>My expectations my have been unrealistically high. But honestly the next night we went to Farmhouse in River North / Near North and I liked everything about it more than Girl and the Goat (they even have a direct competitor in the above-the-neck pig parts division, a great pig ear dish that beats GatG's pig face hands down).

Ordered the sweet corn goat cheese wontons. Really good, liked it a lot. No meat though but exactly what you would expect. Also got the grill seared shi tuna. That was alright. Pretty much just raw tuna that is slightly cooked covered in a sauce. The diver scallops were delicious. My only problem there was that it was $17 for 2 scallops. Yea they were big but whoa, 8.50 for one. yikes.<br><br>Kalbi beef ribs were next. They were alright too. I like the taste but I mean you could go to a KBBQ place and it would taste the same to me.

He even asked if I had any dietary restrictions/allergies--I know this is such a minor detail but this made me really happy! It is so incredibly rare for restaurants to ask this upfront. I believe the only other time I was ever asked this upfront was when I was at a Michelin star restaurant in SF. I am severely allergic to nuts and so 95% of the time I'M the one that has to ask them if the dish I'm looking at has any nuts and it can be sort of a guessing game. He gave me a marked-up menu detailing any dishes that had nuts which genuinely made me happy lol.<br><br>They talk you through the menu if it's your first time there, which was nice! I ordered the Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face and the goat belly--BOTH WERE AMAZING. I can't even describe how much I loved these dishes. Perfect balance of flavor. I did find the vanilla in the fennel sauce for the goat belly to be a little weird, I think just because I don't like sweet in my savory foods. I still ate it all though haha. I had mentioned it was my first time in Chicago ever and so they even gave me their Sauteed Green Beans on the house!! That was delicious too but between my other 2 entrees, I only finished half of it. The Sauteed Green Beans is definitely good for 2-3 people as a side. For dessert I got the Caramel Corn and Malt Balls, but like a mini portion of it because I was saying how incredibly full I was. I love caramel corn and the saltiness of that with the vanilla malt gelato was really yummy. A lot of times I dislike desserts because they're too sweet but this was just right.<br><br>For drinks, I'm terrible because I can't even remember the name of the drink I ordered and it's not on their online menu.

If you're up for a loud night of cocktails and sampling with a group of friends, this is a perfect place to go. If you're looking for excellent food to impress a significant other, I probably wouldn't go here unless your date is a sucker for creative foods. It's loud. Very loud.

I think going at 4pm is also another viable option for procuring some space.<br><br>I'm surprised by the reviews that purport that flavor was lacking in these dishes. To me, the unique and powerful flavors were the hallmark of this food. Every dish had a very distinctive flavor profile that was unusual in some way -- and most of it worked, although on one dish it didn't. As for each dish:<br><br>Pig face: slow-cooked pig cheek, and it was very good. It's basically a glorified roast pork. But the best part about the pig face was the little fried potato straws and the fried egg on top. The textures came together in a wonderful, crunchy, mushy way that I really enjoyed. This is definitely a dish worth getting. On the salty side.<br><br>Roasted Cauliflower: Roasted and slightly carmelized cauliflower tossed with heaps of parmesan cheese, olive oil, pine nuts and mint. Mint!! This really gave the vegetable an unexpected kick, and those dainty pine nuts knocked it out of the park. The downside to this was that it was swimming in oil. It was way too greasy. Gives me great ideas for making cauliflower at home.<br><br>Squash blossom: A hollowed out piece of squash stuffed with crabmeat, dipped in tempura and flash fried. Of course, delicious. Lacking body in flavor though. The filling was kind of bland. Texture was great. Only two pieces in a serving. Wouldn't necessarily order it again.<br><br>Goat confit: Strange combination of confit goat belly (small piece, preparation similar to the pig's face, slow-cooked), lobster, ginger and some other bright citrus/cilantro flavor that didn't quite work in the end. Enjoyed the goat belly itself, but thought that the accompaniments detracted from the main attraction. Maybe they are afraid people won't be used to the strong flavor of goat?<br><br>Butterscotch budino: Probably the best dessert I've ever had. GET IT!! Even if you're full, just get it. It's so light and refreshing. Light-as-air whipped Italian custard with cinnamon, carmelized cashews, butterscotch sauce and pineapple chunks. It was incredibly refreshing and the mix of creamy, tart, crunchy and sweet were perfect.<br><br>Overall, we enjoyed our meal at Girl and the Goat. I didn't enjoy the fact that it was a loud machine.

Nothing was bad, and one course was outstanding: a goat with bourbon butter and lobster. The sauce was to-die-for and we even found ourselves pouring the remaining vegetables on the plate to cover then with that beautiful flavor... Without embarrassment. The lobster, however, was to my taste quite abundant.<br><br>One other course I remember was wood oven roasted pig face which without doubt was delicious, but would have suited way better as a hung over breakfast a late Sunday morning.<br><br>I probably wont go back since I find it ridiculous to wait for a table for two months.

The mix of the sweet corn, tomatoes and, popcorn (yes! delicious and unexpected) was perfect. <br><br>2) Escargot ravioli - the tamarind-miso sauce gives this dish a very rich flavor.<br><br>3) Roasted cauliflower - in the span of 2 days I had 3 different roasted cauliflower dishes: Purple Pig, Gilt Bar, and here. The cauliflower at Girl & the Goat was definitely my favorite. <br><br>4) Kona kampachi crudo  - dish is small, but the fish was so fresh<br><br>5) Pig face - it was good, but I can't say it was my favorite dish. We weren't sure how to eat the dish. The waitress told us to mix everything together: \"the messier it looks, the better it will taste!\" Truth. <br><br>6) Crisp braised pork shank - fall off the bone delicious. The meat is a great pair with the naan and sauces<br><br>7) Kalbi beef ribs - very tender and the okra was a nice addition to the plate<br><br>8) Culture club - we started off with the culture club. The bread (baked in house) was so soft and paired so well with the butter and pickled raisins. <br><br>9) Grilled baby octopus <br><br>10) Confit goat belly <br><br>11) Fried pickles - the shallot aioli and yuzu harissa (2 sauces it came with) tasted odd on its on. Dip the pickles in both sauces at once; they taste better combined. <br><br>12) Sugo <br><br>13) Diver scallops - dish was still very good, but nothing special<br><br>Last note: do not skip out on the miso-butterscotch budino.

After waiting for months, we got a reservation to Girl and the Goat. I was super excited, since I'm a huge fan of Stephanie Izard and absolutely love Little Goat across the street. <br><br>G&TG is a small plates restaurant, where you order a few to try and share among your dining companions.

Husband and I are teetotalers, so we opted not to get any drinks (good thinking, since they were $13 a pop) and ordered a few plates to share.<br><br>We got the goat belly, goat empanadas, hamachi crudo, calamari bruschetta, ham frites, and duck tongues.

I thought that was pretty cool (husband said he would have preferred the opposite, but he would have gotten The Itis after the first course, I guarantee you). I enjoyed everything, but there were some dishes I enjoyed more than others. <br><br>The goat belly was delicious, as always. The bourbon butter it was in was very sweet and too weird for me. I also could have sworn I tasted peanut butter in it! The goat empanadas were funky but tasty. I ate the avocado/blueberry sauce that was leftover with a spoon. The hamachi crudo was the star of the night: light fish with little pieces of pork belly and chili aoili. The calamari bruschetta was soooo oily. It was delicious, don't get me wrong, but it was swimming in a pool of oil or butter, maybe a bit of both. It made me glad I don't have my gallbladder anymore. The ham frites were tasty shoestring fries with some kind of ham salt, served with smoked tomato aioli and beer cheese sauce. The duck tongues were great! They just tasted like fried clams. There were little pieces of raw tuna mixed in as well. We didn't get dessert, but instead opted to go across the street to Little Goat and get a Choco Taco sundae.<br><br>Another thing worth noting that I appreciate: they leave a wine bottle of room temperature water at the table.

The grilled octopus one medium and five tiny pieces of octopus in the entire dish the rest were green beans and other vegetables also nothing spectacular here.

It would have been so great if the saltiness level was brought down a few notches.<br><br>Duck Tongue Salad - I like the combination of the flavors; it's bright and fun. While other components were perfectly seasoned...Duck tongue was SO SALTY. The duck tongue was also really greasy... and then in combination of the fried wonton stripes.. it's like having 2 types of greasy croutons in one dish. I enjoy the flavors of this dish, but can only do a couple spoonfuls at a time.<br><br>Goat Liver Mousse - my favorite out of all the items. It is served with these fluffy buttered biscuit like bread along with blueberry compote and a couple of house picked vegetables. It's an elevated version of the biscuit with grape jelly you'd see often in a southern meal. If the biscuit (or the butter on it) was less salty, I can probably eat the whole platter myself. <br><br>Roasted Cauliflower - pretty good. combination of mint and cheese on roasted cauliflower worked well; pickled pepper helped cut through the greasiness of the dish. Pine nuts didn't add much to the dish, though.<br><br>Roasted Pig Face - :( I LIVE for big pieces of braised fatty pork with skin on.. but I just didn't like the combination of this one. The pork was very mildly seasoned (especially comparing to how salty their other dishes are); I don't know how they cooked it.. but there was no longer any distinction between the skin, the fat, or the meat. When you bite into it, the whole thing just becomes liquid fat in your mouth, and then you get more greasiness from the super skinny potato sticks... it was hard to swallow or take a second bite. The maple balsamic sauce could have helped to brighten the flavor and cut through the grease, but there was so little of the sauce on the plate. <br><br>Overall, a lot of the dishes we tried are overly salted and very heavy.

 About the size of a man's fist, the tender meat literally fell off the bone as our server broke it down tableside for us to enjoy.  Meant to be sandwiched between the baked naan with a bit of tangy Korean slaw, creamy buttermilk dressing, and a hint of red buffalo sauce, the balance of smoky ranch flavors made for the most gluttonous dish of the night!

The scallops were perfectly seared and the sauce complemented it perfectly. Grade: A-.<br><br>4) Steamed clams - The saltiest blackbean sauce clams I've ever eaten. I was LEAST impressed with this dish because i believe fresh clams should be cooked in a lighter sauce. The flavor should sing without many bells and whistles. Unfortunately, these clams were drowned in a saltwater bath. Grade: B-. <br><br>5) Crisp soft shell crab - Loooooved These. The legs were crunchy, light fried crispy. The body of the crab was so juicy, soft and tender. Served over a delicious creamy curry-flavored sauce. To die for. Grade: A+. <br><br>6) Grilled baby octopus - Another hit!! Loved Stephanie Izzard's combination of vegetables with the nicely grilled baby octopus. A bowl of fun, fresh flavors that perfectly complement the star = octopus!!! Grade: A. <br><br>One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago = Up there with MK and Graham Elliot!! <br><br>I was majorly impressed with the flavors and the great service. Stephanie Izzard deserves her Top Chef win!!! <br><br>Last words - This restaurant is perfect for a date.

Maybe it's her focus on her national food truck tour or the galloping success of the Little Goat, but Girl & The Goat isn't an obvious reflection of awesome.<br><br>We went again last night and were seated in the same section as before (by the windows) where it is cold. We had the same server who worked like a wind-up toy on crack (all smiles but impersonal, jerky movements, and an uncanny knack at recitation). His steam must have started to run out partway through dinner because he checked on us less. My friend commented that they could have flipped our table much faster if he checked on us more, brought us the dessert menu, and served us faster. And it seemed obvious they were in the business of flipping tables as the hostesses came by with clip boards taking notes on the status of all of the dining guests.<br><br>We thought the food was not nearly as mind-blowing as our first time. Once again, I thought everything was extremely salty. It was a lot harder to taste all of the flavor layers for which Stephanie Izard is renowned. My sister (who would salt her salt) loved everything except for the cauliflower. I would say the best things we had were:<br><br>- bread<br>- ham frites<br>- pig face<br>- pork belly<br><br>Oh - and of course my cocktails.<br><br>I am planning to go again in a few months. I made that reservation for a party of ten. I expected to give my debit/credit card number to secure the reservation but I was upset when they emailed me an authorization form to complete and sign. The authorization form says that I will pay $35/person if we don't show up or if we cancel within 48 hours of our reservation. There was something about having to sign a form and having to pay $350 for a no-show/late-cancellation that I found to be extremely off-putting.<br><br>It's nice that Girl & the Goat is so popular, but now I think that it's over-rated.

Overall, the dishes were too heavy, and either salty or oily, lacking delicacy (which although may be somewhat a feature of the dishes and the style of food, but it is a little too much nevertheless)<br><br>I'll start with the individual rating of the dishes<br>Shishito peppers: This was literally a bowl of peppers with Parmesan on top and a pool of salty miso on the bottom. I like peppers as much as the next person, and I hate to complain about large portion size. However, it became a burden at the end to have to eat our way through innumerous peppers (without some other element to break up the monotony of the dish). The peppers at the bottom were soggy and the whole dish was relatively oversalted. I would recommend this if your party is large and you want to each eat like 4 peppers, but it would be a travesty to order this if you are say out for a date night, because get ready to eat peppers.<br><br>Goat Liver: literally the highlight of my night, I wanted to give a whole other star just for the sake of this dish. the mushroom, pickles and i believe it is kumquat went so amazingly with rich goat liver. My one caveat is that the bread which came with this was overly rich, and it is unnecessary to have so heavy and oily a bread to go with something already so rich<br><br>Short ribs: Not bad, but unremarkable. They were not quite melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the sauce was not lick my plate good. A solid dish, but not one that deserves raving.<br><br>Ham frites: This is probably my fault in part for having fries ordered, but its fries with a cloyingly salty and rich ham powder sprinkled on top. Again, the dish lacks any element of lightness, or anything to counterbalance the straight oily saltiness<br><br>Duck breast: this was so disappointing; the sauce was a two-bit teriyaki which tasted too sweet and could have come out of a costco frozen half duck packet. the shrimp could have saved the day if there was slightly more of it, but there was probably 3/4 of one shrimp cut into the dish. the meat itself was not badly cooked, but as was the theme of the night, was unremarkable<br><br>goat carpaccio: good dish, solid 4/5 I would say, but again, it was topped with some fried kale (If I remember correctly); fried things become a crunchy crutch<br><br>goat empanadas: I was really so unimpressed with this. it was a 14$ dish that had no distinctive feature. the goat? not poorly seasoned but had no \"wow\" factor. The dough part was similarly unimpressive. If I had been handed this empanada off a food cart, I would have been satisfied, but not from a restaurant of this stature. <br><br>chickpea fritters: I was very confused about how I felt about this dish. the fritters were doughy and delicious, but they came accompanied by what seemed to be an arbitrarily complement of salad<br><br>overall, come relatively hungry; four college students could not polish off 8 dishes so at least the portion are relatively good for a \"small plate\" restaurant (but this also speaks to the heaviness)", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This is one of the toughest Yelp reviews I've ever had to write.

I have so much respect and appreciation for the manager and our waiter the night we dined here because they really made a difference in our dining experience.<br><br>After months of waiting, my boyfriend finally scored a dinner reservation and we came for my 30th birthday on Saturday night. We ordered several dishes on the menu and each can only be described as SALTY. I do not consider myself \"salt sensitive\" and I can appreciate salty foods. I expected that many of the dishes we ordered would be salty due to the ingredients but everything was so overly salty that everyone at the table felt sick by the end of the evening.<br><br>To be fair, we knew the roasted beets contained anchovies and the sauteed green beans contained fish sauce. I get that the dishes should be salty but we could not finish even one of these dishes between three people. Each dish ordered after these two should not have been salty but the roasted cauliflower, pan roasted arctic char and pork belly tasted extremely salty. At this point, my boyfriend brought up the issue with our awesome waiter, Brennan. He seemed surprised that we weren't enjoying our meal and couldn't finish any of the dishes we had up to that point and let the manager know. Aaron, the manager, immediately apologized to our entire table and said he would take care of everything. The chefs were advised to go easy on the salt for our final two dishes, the confit goat belly and the pig face. The pig face was delicious, perfectly crisp and seasoned just the right amount. I wish I could have enjoyed it more but by this point, I was already feeling sick from the previous dishes. The miso-butterscotch budino was wonderful as well.<br><br>Throughout the rest of our meal, our waiter continued to check on us and make sure we were enjoying our food. He was genuinely hurt that we didn't enjoy the food and assured us that Stephanie Izard herself would be speaking to the chefs the next day she returned to the restaurant.

You swirl it all up and dig in. All the elements reminded us almost of a breakfast dish. The meat was cut into pieces and vaguely bacon-y taste. The sweet of the red wine and maple infused the potato stix. The cilantro sauce was almost more of a garnish, which is good since that taste can over balance an already intense dish. We liked the inclusion of the egg. It was rich, sweet, and salty.<br><br>The service here is very friendly and knowledgeable. I had a fun conversation with the manager (a GQ looking man).

There are booths and tables, and we fortunately got a cute corner booth.<br><br>RESERVATIONS:<br>harder to get than most restaurants.

I recommend looking at weekdays, or later seating times, and smaller group size. maybe if you have a specific schedule in advance you can call ahead and snatch that table?<br><br>OVERALL:<br>Finally visited Girl and the Goat.

I thought I'd add my two cents by ranking everything I had and saying what I most liked about it so here goes!<br><br>Ranked from favorite to least favorite: <br><br>1. The Green Beans. I know, it's a veggie! How could it be number one on the list? It's the most flavorful, crunchy green beans I have ever tasted! Very savory and delicious, just fullllll of flavor! My friend and I could not stop eating this dish. Absolutely get it! <br><br>2. Close second: The pig face. Wouldn't have ordered it had it not been for all of the magnificent reviews about it! Our waiter and the chef recommended that we just mix everything (open the egg and mix it all together) instead of splitting it down the middle because if we do so, we might miss some of the flavors. Great recommendation! A great mix of sweet and savory, and melt in your mouth pig face! As others have mentioned, it definitely doesn't look like pig face, so no worries there. Anyway, definitely delicious!<br><br>3. The miso butterscotch budino. Delicious!! Our waiter recommended it and we were a little skeptical because the description wasn't very compelling, but the description definitely didn't do it justice. It had a nice sponge cake and all the flavors (the candied cashews, the whipped cream, the cake, the toffee, the pineapple) all came together to give a nice flavor that wasn't too sweet. Since my sweet tooth is not as prominent as that of some others, this was the perfect dessert for me (although I didn't taste the bacon...not necessarily a bad thing, just a note, it's not a strong flavor). <br><br>4. The goat blue bread. Soooo delicious. Very savory bread with lots of flavor. I love goat cheese so this was definitely the bread for me. I wasn't crazy about the onion jam, so I preferred the fig butter with it. Very good! <br><br>5. The miso hungry bread. This was a little bit toned down compared to the miso bread. The apple sauce spread was delicious! The bread was great, but not as good as the goat blue. So you can't really go wrong, but it depends on if you want a bread that has a more subtle flavor (miso) vs. one that is packs a nice punch (goat blue).<br><br>6. The goat empanadas. I may have eaten this wrong, since there were a lot of toppings and elements to it that I didn't really get to incorporate (I took the one on top and my friend took the one on the bottom). It was good, but I felt the goat filling could have been a little more seasoned. It tasted a little plain, but I was still quite impressed by everything! Will definitely be back! <br><br>Next time I will try the cauliflower since I heard that was also an amazing dish. Also, the service was great. The chef came out and described all the dishes in great detail. The waiter was super nice and friendly and gave us recommendations  when we asked for them (and great ones at that!).

The space is hip and modern and the service was fast and friendly. The portions are just the right size and I appreciated the small menu. I think keeping the menu small allows them to do the few dishes they serve well. I'll definitely be back to try the other menu options. The only reason I can't give my experience 5 stars is due to the price point. Being that the concept is that of ordering at a counter and picking it up at a counter, I feel the price is high.

Here you can eat one without shame (or with it if you're into that kind of joy reducing eating) because they are quality made and hit the spot. Their take on the cinnabon is called Ooey Gooey Cinnabun<br><br>The bad(ish): Nothing bad for me so far. Only maybe that they don't give me an extra stomach when I walk in so I can enjoy more food. It is on the louder side even during the weekday. If you're on a date I recommend the smaller 2 person booths instead the 4 person table, or a seat at the bar-like seating in the dinning room. It will be more intimate. If you have a group, grab a booth but don't expect to hear the person diagonal from you without some work.<br><br>The good/great: I'll keep this short. It's quality food, done right, and offers unique flavors on foods you already like. Like kimchi (or want to try it)? Like pancakes? You're in luck: Kimchee Pancakes.

The atmosphere is not uncomfortably pretentious like in other restaurants of this popularity and price range, and my food baby is proof of just how much I enjoyed the food. They recommend ordering 4-5 dishes for 2 people, but my friend and I, wanting so badly to try everything, ordered seven things in total. <br>1. Miso Hungry: I could not tell the butter was miso butter, but whatever it was it was delicious. The kimchi also was refreshing, and made the bread+butter combination not too cloying. Now on to the bread. Oh. My. God. The bread arguably was my favorite part of the entire night. I'm not sure what type it was, but it was just slightly sweet and incredibly buttery and flavorful. A great way to start the night!<br>2. Roasted Beets: I love beets, so I never will complain about a beet salad, but this one was genuinely one of the best I've had. The greens and the avocado creme fraiche were so textured and beautiful. And the BREAD CRUMBS. (What is with place and bread-ish products? So good!)<br>3. Chickpea Fritter: The garam masala yogurt actually makes the dish. The fritters obviously were amazing, but without the creamy/cold nature the yogurt provided, the dish may have been too fried. It was also just a beautiful dish. The golden, white, green, and purple (!) colors worked so well together.<br>4. Wood Grilled Broccoli: Possibly my least favorite dish of the night. Don't get me wrong... It was still wonderful, but it was just less innovative than the other parts of the meal. The crispies were a fun surprise, but the bleu cheese was just slightly too rich for my taste. The wood grilled taste was still great, though.<br>5. Sweet Potato Bleu Pierogis: My friend's favorite dish of the night. The mushroom sauce and mushroom ragout underneath and the apple slices above the pierogis were such welcome additions. The pierogi filling was just the right amount of sweet, and the crispiness of the dough was something I will continue to crave for a long, long time.<br>6. Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face: My friend is a vegetarian, so the above dishes we ordered all excluded meat, but I had to try this dish that I had heard so much about. This was perhaps the most aesthetically pleasing dish of the night. So photogenic. The pig face was honestly a little too rich for me, and I could have done with a little less of it. But despite the fact that this is not a dish for those who don't enjoy the fat part of their meat, the first few bites were so flavorful that I could not help but eat the rest. The sunny side egg was, as sunny side eggs oft are, an awesome touch, and I ate every single one of the \"potato stix\" on my plate.<br>7. Goat Cheesecake: A little underwhelming, but still so delectable. The goat cheese taste was strong but not overpowering, and the presence of beer in the form of \"beer kisses\" (which tasted like caramel corn... and I am not complaining about that) and beer caramel added a depth to the dessert that otherwise I feel like I would have missed. Again, not my favorite part of the night, but still absolutely recommended.<br><br>A glutton/foodie's delight. Bravo Stephanie Izard.

Period. I'm not saying it's not good, it's better than average. But for a place with over 2000 Yelp reviews and 4.5 stars, I definitely expected to be blown away, and that didn't happen. Maybe it's too popular to keep its quality? Or maybe it's the branching out into little goat that distracted chef's effort and talent? <br><br>To be clear, this is not the first time we came to g&g. We came here when it first opened in 2010, twice within a month, because back then reservation was WAY easier and we were simply amazed at how great the food was and how talented chef Izard was. Fast forward to present, it's near to impossible to score a reservation within two months, and the food we had really wasn't that great. Here's what we had: <br>- Bread with tomato oil and mushroom butter: this was the best dish we had all night. The combination of tomato oil and mushroom butter reminded me of dipping the bread in tomato soup. The bread was amazing, not too hard, not to soft, perfectly fluffy. 5 out of 5 stars. <br>- Oysters: I could be biased, but those were west coast oysters and I hate west coast oysters. We got the uncooked ones, so all I could judge was the little pickles on top of the oysters and they were OK. 3 of 5 stars. <br>- Beets salad: this was extremely average. I regret getting it. It's beets salad with dressing and breadcrumbs. There's no complexity to it, maybe it's the point of salad? But I was eating it and thinking did girl and the goat really just serve me such an average salad? I refuse to even review it. <br>- Escargot ravioli: the sauce was very tasty. However, we didn't think the concept of escargot ravioli works--it's a little too dry if you just eat the ravioli by itself. The escargot needed more butter, needed more salt, and the dish didn't give me enough sauce to compensate for the lack of butter or salt. 3 of 5 stars.<br>- Goat belly confit: I don't like goat, so I ate the lobster on the plate. But this was a really one dimension plate--gamey goat, creamy sauce, lobster meat in some other creamy sauce. There's no contrast in either texture or flavor. And quite honestly goat and lobster really just didn't agree with each other. 1 of 5 stars. <br>- Pig face: yes, this used to be my favorite and it has been on their menu since the day they opened. It's still very good, even though it was indeed on a little heavy side, I enjoyed every bite of it. 4 of 5 stars.<br>- Miso butterscotch dessert: It was actually quite yummy. But I can't candidly judge anything butterscotch because it just simply can't compare to the unbelievably amazing miso butterscotch shake that I'm in love with at Allium. 4 of 5 stars.  <br><br>So overall, I was tempted to give a 2 stars. But one thing made it up a little--somehow, there's record in their system that we had food allergy. Even though we haven't been here in a LONG LONG time, they remembered. And our lovely waitress also made sure to confirm with us in the beginning. I'm a sucker for this type of attention to small details. OK, I will give it 3 stars.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Hg0w9YkRtMSLTYl4FXgwZw/348s.jpg", "caption": "Pig face"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hXmhNdWDvashkNHzunBC4Q/168s.jpg", "caption": "Goat belly confit"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "This place blew me away again.

Anyway, you could tell it was aged and cooked perfectly.<br><br>Great night, great dinner.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I recently moved to Chicago and I've had numerous people tell me to visit Girl and the Goat while I'm here. Not only that, I watch Top Chef and (very recently) The Taste and the guest mentor and judge on one of the episodes was Chef Stephanie Izard so I was ecstatic when I was able to get a reservation in for my sister's birthday this past weekend. I booked two weeks in advance and we got a table for 10:45 PM on a Saturday.  <br><br>This place was kind of like tapas style, small dishes, so we ordered one item from each category (Bread, Oyster, Goat, Vegetable, Seafood, Meat, Dessert):<br><br>Herbs of a Feta<br>Fried Naked Cowboys<br>Chickpea Fritter<br>Pan Roasted Monkfish<br>Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face<br>Confit Goat Belly<br>Citrus Pavlova<br>Miso-Butterscotch Budino<br><br>For the bread, we ordered the Herbs of a Feta. Crispy on the outside and so soft on the inside. You can taste the herbs. I loved the hummus and dipping the bread into the feta oil. So tasty and great aroma. <br><br>After the bread, we had the Fried Naked Cowboys. I was hesitant about ordering this at first. I like my oysters raw. I usually don't appreciate it any other way but raw. My sister, however, doesn't eat raw oysters and the waiter said his favorite was the Fried Naked Cowboys. When it came out, it already looked so good. Each oyster was on a spoon already with the egg salad and capers. Mmmm it was one delicious, flavorful bite!<br><br>Next up was the DELICIOUS Chickpea Fritter. Wow. I HAVE to learn how to make this because I know I can't keep coming back every weekend just for this one dish. The outside was so crispy and when you bite into it, the chickpea filling was SO soft. The texture was perfect. Mixed with the other stuff in the bowl and it's the perfect vegetable dish. This was my sister's and my favorite of the night. We love chickpea (hence the hummus with the bread and then this dish with chickpea too).<br><br>For the fish/seafood, we tried the Monkfish. This was good but we didn't talk about it after dinner, like the way we would about the things we absolutely loved. We talked about the next time we would try the other stuff under their seafood section, like the Hamachi Crudo, Striped Bass or the Scallops so the Monkfish didn't blow us away or we would talk about that instead, but it was still good. <br><br>Majority of the reviews mentioned the Pig Face. This dish is special because you cannot find it at most \"American\" places. It's common at certain Asian places. This was wood oven roasted and you can taste it too. It smelled so good. The meat was crispy and had fatty areas so it balanced really well. It was topped off with a sunny side egg. Move the egg over a bit and cut it so the yolk falls on top of the meat and eat it altogether, with the other stuff on the plate. It's a really great bite. If you cut it with the egg sitting on top, the way it's brought out, then the yolk will just fall to the sides and onto the plate itself, not the meat. <br><br>Next up was the Confit Goat Belly. This was delicious, not because the star was the goat belly, but because they also had lobster, crab and fennel with the dish. Cut up a piece of the goat belly, add a piece of the lobster and crab, then scrape the food with the bourbon butter on the plate, and eat it all in one bite. The flavors were there. The texture worked. This was the perfect bite of surf and turf.<br><br>On a side note, the table next to us was raving about their Goat Empanadas. I heard the lady say the Goat Empanadas were the best empanadas they have ever had. I'll try that next time, but thought it was still worth mentioning on here.<br><br>After the food, it was time for dessert! At this point, we were craving for something sweet so it was perfect timing. We wanted something fruity and ordered the Citrus Pavlova. Wow. I could eat this ALL DAY. There were so many different components in this bowl. There was blood orange, yuzu curd, ice cream, kumquats, this thing that was like vanilla meringue (I have to learn how to make this!). This was PERFECT after all the other dishes. The next thing was probably an even more perfect ending to an amazing meal. Since it was my sister's birthday, they brought out a small serving of the Miso-Butterscotch Budino (bacon toffee, glazed pineapple, candied cashews) on the house. This was the most amazing dessert. I was about to lick the miso-butterscotch off the wooden board it was served to us on, but I refrained from doing so. 2-3 days later, my sister and I are STILL talking about the ice cream, the yuzu curd, the miso-butterscotch with the toffee and the pineapple chunks.<br><br>Yup, we are definitely going back.

Girl & the Goat is mind-blowing. Perfection at it's finest, and everything a restaurant should be. There is a reason why it is still tough to get a reservation here after almost 5 years since its birth. I took the bf here last night for his 30th birthday celebration and we were instantly impressed starting with the music. It's such a cool space and they pump out ridiculous tunes, both old and new school...everything from to Ellie Goulding, to House of Pain, to Santana. Such a party. When making the reservation I was sure to tell the hostess it was for a bday celebration and everyone from our waiter to the water boy wished my love a happy birthday...it was so fun! Speaking of the staff, I have to be sure to mention the fact that they are TOP NOTCH. The most attentive service I've seen in a long time. We really felt like we were the only people in the restaurant with the way we were being taken care of. When actually, the place was a packed house for a Sunday evening. At one point, my boyfriend was so ecstatic about homemade ranch (to be discussed later) that he ended up spilling it all over his coat and floor...about 3 servers rushed up to clean it off him and even came over with a cup of club soda and a towel to spot clean his coat...like, what? The service is bananas!<br><br>In a natural fashion we started out with a cocktail. Me, the Local 75, and the boy went with the old goat. Mine was deliciously refreshing and his was a classic old-fashioned. Both amazing. I will tell you what we ordered for the food, but my words can't even begin to do it justice. Please trust when I say each dish was better than the next:<br><br>Honey sambal brioche<br>Celery root and cheddar pierogi's<br>Sautéed green beans<br>Nantucket bay scallops<br>Wood oven roasted pig face<br>Crisp braised pork shank<br><br>We ordered everything at once and our waiter spaced everything to perfection and according to tastes. All of it was delectable, but the CUTAGRA was absolutely the pork shank. This my friends, was drop dead, hands down, the best dish I've ever had in all my life. The pork was crisp on the outside, tender on the inside and served with warm, house made naan, buttermilk ranch, a tangy buffalo-type sauce and butternut squash kimchee. The flavor explosion is unexplainable. It's a must have at Girl & the Goat. <br><br>We didn't want to come down from our food high, so we ordered the bittersweet chocolate for dessert. It was similar to a warm brownie served with shiitake caramel gelato and toffee creme. Wow. Unreal. Also, our waiter brought my bf a piece of sticky date cake with a candle to give him a bday wish....how cute is that? <br><br>Over all our experience and Girl & the Goat was exceptional. It's officially now my favorite restaurant in all of Chicago. The only downfall I could see happening is that it may ruin me for all future meals to come because, well, this is the BEST THERE IS.

I could have eaten about 10 in one sitting, if you go, you need to order these, the dough was perfect,the potatoes were tasty, I mean everything was just to the tee...they reminded me of an empanada...which I make all the time at home, so my tummy was extremely happy (third brownie point).  Next was the roasted pig face, just the name itself is worth ordering. So this dish was quite yummy, it was I believe two pieces of pork belly with these yummy crunchy potato stix in between with a sunny side egg on top and it had a few sauces on the dish as well.  If you get this, I recommend popping the egg yolk and mixing everything together so that you can get bites full of deliciousness (fourth brownie point!).  <br><br>Finally we ordered dessert, why not, right?  We ordered a chocolate malt dessert that came with hard shell, I forgot the name, but it was good and they brought me a dessert on the house for my birthday with a candle, it was the tres leche dessert--wow is all I have to say, the cake was so moist, not too sweet, it was divine (fifth brownie point!!!!)<br><br>Overall, I think this place is worth checking out, it's best to make a reservation ahead of time, you may need to do it two-three months ahead but it's well worth it.  I have to give it to Stephanie Izard, her and her staff have a great little gem here with Girl and a Goat!!!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Booking in advance is a must.  This place is popular.<br><br>The restaurant is located on a busy Chicago street.

It set the mood and expectation for the rest of the meal.<br><br>beef short rib - crispy fried rice neatly layer the top of three pieces of short ribs, with the heads of small mushrooms peeking through them. The beef, quite unexpectedly, melts in your mouth. Literally. I could feel the meat gently come apart, soft and perfect.<br><br>mushroom ragout - small mushrooms blended with creme fraiche and capers adorn rectangular agnolotti that confine buttery mashed sweet potatoes waiting to burst in your mouth and send your taste buds into a frenzy. This was my favorite dish - I love mushrooms and ravioli and sweet potatoes. The sauce in this dish is a sort of gently sweet tomato creme concoction. It makes you almost want to cry.<br><br>wood grilled broccoli - not my favorite, but then I've never liked broccoli, though I still managed to finish my serving of these smoked stalks over, what I'm guessing to be, whipped cream cheese with spices and garnished with little (pumpkin?) toasted seeds.<br><br>crisp braised pork shank - a highlight that everyone must try. A shank of pork served with spicy kimchi sauce (which I only just tasted because I can't stand spicy food), kimchi, flat bread and yogurt mixed with cooling spices.<br>The meat stays together as you cut and serve, but the moment your fork latches onto a piece and places it in your mouth is when the symphony begins. The meat is perfect. The skin crisp. It just soothes and hones your palette at the same time. Top it with a jot of the kimchi sauce for a glance of sweetness that gives way to a rolling wave of heat. Fantastic way to end the meal, I think.<br><br>We were happy, full and completely awed by the food. As much as I would have loved to try the date cake, I could not have managed another bite so we concluded our journey of food ecstasy for the evening.<br><br>I'd go back here just to try out the other dishes.

This was like chewing on rubber bands that sat on a grill. The taste was entirely fat and grill. There was no magic moment, of \"holy crap this is the best thing i ever had\" The sauce that came with it had zero flavor - The only thing that broke away from the taste of rubbery grill was the blood oranges. <br><br>Then came the cauliflower. After hardly eating the Pork Belly I was looking forward to a flavor other than \"seasoned heavily with grill.\"  The cauliflower was more of the same. It tasted just like the grill flavor of the pork belly, only this time highly salted because of the pickle mix... and salt. I'm guessing the salt brought out the grill flavor even more. <br><br>We really love eating out, we love big flavors and interesting meals - but this place just really felt like it was all the same.

Not a good sign when a member of your group asks the server when the duck duck bread is coming out after mistakenly eating it thinking it was complimentary house bread and butter to start off our meal (cue in Debbie Downer music....wah waaaaah).  <br><br>Grilled Baby Octopus-  The interplay of the smokiness of the octopus and the unsmoked Italian bacon (guanciale) are nicely balanced by the hint of acid from the lemon vinaigrette and I thought it was a clever touch slicing the celery root and red bliss potato into similar size squares to create the visual illusion of two ingredients appearing as one and being pleasantly surprised by contrasting textures on the palate.  The additional nuttiness and aromatic crunch from the braised pistachios completed the brilliant combination.   <br><br>Scallops- I rarely order scallops as a main entry since I liken their ceiling in quality much like Norm MacDonald describes the two categories of cliffdivers: grand champion and stuff on a rock.  In this case the scallops were cooked to perfection although the alternative would have been gummy stuff on a plate.  What makes this dish stand out are the accompanying players of pumpkin brandade, pecans, fried brussel sprouts, tarragon, and fresh pomegranate seeds.  Creative chaos at its best.   <br><br>Sugo-  this was one of those dishes you just knew had to be good based on its description:  a meat sauce of goat, pork, and veal atop fresh made pappardelle with cape gooseberries and drizzle of bechamel.  Unlike a traditional meat sauce, sugo is pretty much meat gently binded by a light amount of tomato sauce allowing  each separate meat to stand out rather than blend together like a traditional ragu.   I've had several variations of pappardelle with meat sauce in my dining adventures and this one will be my new gold standard.<br><br>Cauliflower- roasted and then dressed with pickled peppers, pine nuts, and mint. A nice break from the onslaught of meat courses which elevates a relatively bland veggie to rockstar status.  Can't wait to make this at home.<br><br>Pork Shank- crispy braised flintstone style hunk of meat accompanied by butternut squash/shitake kimchee, buttermilk dressing, and naan bread.  I liken this to Seinfeld's black/white cookie, rather than racial harmony, the components borrowing elements from Southern, Korean, and Indian cuisine appear to be all clashing on the plate (although thankfully not in the belly).  My least favorite dish of the evening,  All three components were underseasoned, and combining the elements together doesn't really create the United Nations gyro that was intended.<br><br>Goat belly confit- accompanied with lobster/crab, fennel, and brown butter, the goat was unmemorable and being a relatively lean animal, not sure if this cut bears any resemblance to pork belly.  A mediocre iron chef dish that I do not plan to revisit.<br><br>Wood-oven roasted pig face- probably unfair to evaluate this dish since it was at the conclusion of our meal where we were verging on meat sweats, this is a very rich dish with crispy meat topped with sunny side up egg, and deep fried shoestring potato sticks.  Tasty to be sure, but not necessarily in a sophisticated way.  More of a corned beef hash kinda tasty where you know it's a massive calorie bomb, but not quite sure if it will be worth the extra gym sessions to work it off.<br><br>Definitely a worthy dining destination whether you're a local or tourist in Chicago (the Purple Pig is like a poor man's Girl and the Goat if you can't secure reservations) and there were definitely some hits and misses to Chef Izard's whimsical menu, but I appreciate her fearlessness in taking chances since more often than not, she gets it right.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "All I can really say is \"omnomnomnomnomnomnom.\"<br>The waitress was really friendly and made some really great recommendations.  So great that we ate all the yummy yummy food that she recommended, to the point that my friend and I practically waddled out of the restaurant.  My tummy was so full it actually kind of hurt, but I regret nothing.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This place is the hardest place to get a table.

The brussel leaves and lemon gave the octopus a unique flavor that surprised us. <br><br>(4) Wood oven roasted pig face<br>-The pig face melts in your mouth. It is essentially a juicy, tender piece of pork fat with an egg over it and thin potato sticks, that are long thin french fries. I think the french fries took away from the dish- made it a little bit too salty. <br><br>(2) Grilled marinated pork belly<br>-Least impressed with this dish. The pork belly was firm and thick, not chewy like expected. The flavors in this dish was not very interesting either.<br><br>(3) crispy beef short ribs<br>-Some of the short ribs were very tender while olthers were dry and overcooked.It was not a unique dish either as it is very similar to a traditional vietnamese.<br><br>(5) confit goat belly<br>-best dish of the night. Tender goat belly on top of crab! I would get this again.<br><br>(5) Chocolate chip cheese gelato with sticky cake<br>-I'm not sure if this is actually what it's called but it must've been a special because I don't see it on the menu posted online.

It was delicious.<br><br>Drinks:<br>(4) petit verdo blend<br>-I don't know enough about wines, but I enjoyed it!<br><br>Overall, I was only blown away by 2 of the 5 entrees I had the whole night.

For those of you trying to get a sense of how long it will take to get a reservation, I was able to get this one ~2.5 weeks in advance. A prime time (like 6:00) is harder to come by, even on a weekday evening. My friend has also walked in and (after waiting ~two hours) was able to get a spot at the bar. So, miracles do happen, if you're willing to drink at a nearby establishment while waiting. <br><br>We weren't seated right away, which was a little annoying because we had the reservation. But I get that this is a really popular destination and you can't regulate how long people with previous reservations will take at the table. We took our sweet time enjoying our dinner here as a result; we didn't feel rushed at all. We had already decided on our food in the week leading up to our reservation, so we ordered immediately. Our waitress recommended 2-3 dishes per person to share (tapas style). Unless you want lots of leftovers, I discourage you from ordering any more than two per person. We were already almost completely stuffed by the time our third course arrived. Needless to say, we got two almost untouched dishes to go. <br><br>My least favorite dish was the green beans. They didn't taste like anything special and certainly were not worth the ~$10 spent on them. They definitely weren't bad--just your typical green beans with some salty sauce and cashews. With more cashews, I might have been more impressed. The baby octopus was okay (a compliment from a seafood-hater), but the dish really should have had a higher octopus to veggies ratio. The dish was more veggie than octo and the octo was super rubbery. The stand-out dishes for me were the roasted cauliflower, the oven-roasted pig face, and the ham frites.

It's service that you would expect at a Michelin starred restaurant with your water glass never being empty and your napkin always neatly folded when you get up from the table. Ambiance was energetic with upbeat music playing in the background, loud enough that you want to dance in your seat but not so loud that you can't have a conversation with the person across from you. Most importantly, the food was on point. By Owen's recommendation, we tried the halibut which was so well balanced and utterly delicious. My other favorite was the Goat Belly which is a new addition to the menu. It was extra rich and decadent with the addition of crab and lobster; out of this world tasty.

This place has seen the classic Restaurant Hip-ness Curve, from people loving it when it opened to people calling it overhyped.

So not only can you order a ton of different things, but you get to try a ton of different things. Many of them goat. Second, not all of them are goat! There is actually a great variety of things. Two of my all time favorites are the Liver Mousse and the Pig Face -- I think they're delicious. The vegetables also come in pretty reasonable, large portions, so you can fill up on the veggies and taste the other plates. Which brings me to three -- you can usually order enough to actually have a full meal here!! What an absolute rarity!! And for the price, you come out pretty well here -- you can definitely eat really well for $$$, but if you want to make this a $$ kinda night, you could totally pull that off too, just by ordering different (but equally delicious!) things and avoiding drinks.<br><br>The food itself is interesting but not too interesting.

Our server was attentive and very professional as well.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I've been waiting to write my review of Girl & the Goat because I felt that I needed a second experience.  For a restaurant that has so much hype and yet also seems to have so much inconsistency, I felt it was only fair to base my review on multiple visits.<br><br>My first visit was last year, probably about 8 months ago.  We made a reservation in advance, salivated over the menu, hyped up the experience, looked forward to it all week, and were completely underwhelmed.  The chickpea fritters were meh.  The seafood dishes were just okay but nothing spectacular.  The bread was downright hard, dense and disappointing.  My fiance had just been a few months prior to that trip and said our visit was nothing like his first visit (which he describes as one of the best meals of his life).  Everything was fine.  The food was fine.  The service was fine.  The overall experience was fine.  But it was nothing special and nothing that came close to qualifying the hype that surrounds this restaurant.<br><br>This past Saturday, while on a walk around the west loop, my fiance and I hopped in right at 4:30 on a whim and managed to snag a table for an impromptu early dinner.  It was like a completely different experience.  G&G keeps a revolving menu of items, but they also change the way they create their permanent items.  So the chickpea fritters that we ordered last year were nothing like the chickpea fritters they were serving this time.  We ordered 5 items between the two of us, and could easily have stopped at 4 with very full bellies.<br><br>Course 1: Chickpea fritters - absolutely amazing.  A great mixture of okra and tomatoes with the chickpea and heavenly crispy blocks of goat cheese were on top.  Absolutely delicious!<br><br>Course 2: Grilled Baby Octopus - another delicious hit.  The chefs at G&G have this amazing ability to push a taste to the limit.  And the grilled baby octopus pushes the flavor of lemon all the way to the point of extreme, without going over the line to make it overpowering.  The pistachios added a delicious crunch that went well with the charred flavor of the octopus.  And the lemon tartness brought all the other flavors together and smoothed them out.<br><br>Course 3: Driver Scallops - this may have been the only mediocre dish of the night, and by mediocre, I mean it was only very good instead of amazing.  I've had perfect scallops in a variety of places, and these scallops were perfectly cooked but there was nothing special or unique about this dish.  The kimchee and the rapini is a tasty accompaniment, but to be honest, I was tempted to leave the rest of the dish when the sepia came out and just focus on the new and shiny dish at the table.<br><br>Course 4: Grilled Sepia - I had never had sepia prior to this visit and it has a very firm consistency similar to octopus but the taste of this dish was so different, we had no problem with ordering both.  The tomato base of this dish was very tangy and tasty and again there was the presence of extreme lemon.  It was tough to choose a favorite, but I think this might just be my favorite of the night.<br><br>Course 5: Charred Pork Belly - This dish was just for my fiance, but I tried a bit of the flavor and it was excellent.  A nice robust charred flavor that was not too hearty or overwhelming.  He loved the dish.  Pork belly by nature is extremely fatty so he left a good deal of the fat pieces left on the plate, but he certainly licked the rest of it clean.<br><br>Service was wonderful.  We were at a communal table 4 unrelated parties of 2 all seated together, but it still somehow felt intimate enough for just me and my fiance even though we were sitting next to each other.  It was a friendly atmosphere and we enjoyed conversation between ourselves, as well as with the other patrons at the table.  Our waitress was very helpful with advice and recommendations.  The chefs sent out some complimentary fries with various dipping sauces for the table (to promote the social atmosphere) but the ladies in the corner seemed to think it was only for them and sequestered the plate between the two of them.  Clearly, they weren't locals.<br><br>5 courses and 2 drinks came out to under $100 for the two of us and we easily could have gone with one less item.  I was so happy to finally experience the food that lived up to the hype at Girl and the Goat, but I have heard from many that they also have had the same inconsistent experiences.  The only reason this isn't a 5 star for me, is because with the frequency with which G&G is constantly changing their variety, they seem to lose a little bit of credibility for always being consistent in their offerings.  I'll happily come back in another 6-8 months and look forward to whatever batch of creations Stephanie Izard has come up with at that time, but I'm not sold yet on G&G being a dependable mind-blowing experience in every visit..", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "One of my favorite dining experiences.  I've been here 3-4 times but haven't been around in 2 years so this isn't a new review.  Waiters are always knowledgeable and drink selection is deep.  The only gripe I have is that I feel that everything is slightly too salty here.  Maybe it's just me but I realize that I have to drink a lot of water when I'm here.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "My husband took me here on a date, and we sat at the chef's table.

The reason we got was because of timing of the plates, but that didn't really matter to us, so we were like...okay....   (personally i think i twas more the POS system, but if she had told us that rather than timing that would have been fine..)<br>We ended up doing it that way anyways with a plan that we would figure the check out ourselves, then we could tell her what was going on what card. <br><br>Ordering was an issue.  To start, we wanted to order 3 orders of the honey brioche, and 2 of the frites bc those we could share it among everyone. <br>Our waitress discouraged us from ordering that much, so we went with 2 orders of the brioche, and then 1 of fries. <br><br>After we got the bread and frites,  we were left with uneven numbers, so we did go ahead and order another order of bread,  and another order of fries. So it was pointless for her to discourage it. <br><br>When we ordered our mains, we also had some issues. <br>After the group of 3 and 2 ordered,  that left the last group of 2.  Everything they would ask for she would discourage because someone else at the table already ordered it.<br>This left them for limited options so they had to go with something they didn't want to get enough food for the two of them. <br><br>When the plates came, they were pretty small, so not really shareable among 4 people,  so discouraging that they order two of them was incredibly pointless.  <br><br>Unfortunately the service really killed the night for us. <br><br>The food was actually really good. I was in the group of 3 of meat eaters , and we got the shishito peppers, beef tongue, pork belly, and pork shank.  The Old Goat cocktail was SO good! <br><br>The honey brioche was delicious and their fries were super crispy. It was all really really good. <br><br>I just wish our server let us order what we wanted rather than having a disagreement with everything.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I can't believe I have never written a review for G & the G! Shame... seeing that this place has already garnered 1000+ reviews filled with lavish praises, what more can say...<br><br>Some useful tips:<br><br>1) If you want to dine at prime time, make advance reservations. And I mean like 3 months ahead. Their availabilities are shown on OpenTable 3 months out. We make our reservations 3 MONTHS in advance each time so that we can eat at a more normal time say at 7pm. If advance reservations that far out don't work for you, your options will look like either a 5:15pm or 10:15pm seating, IF you're lucky enough to even have those availabilities left to choose from.<br><br>2) If it's just two of you in your party, I highly recommend requesting for kitchen counter seats. They have two sections of kitchen counter seating; one at the entree section (right side) and another at the dessert/appetizer section (left side). Either side is great though the right side has more stuff going on (think sizzling, grilling, etc). Each time we dined at the kitchen counter, we received a couple of additional dishes with compliments of the kitchen. This is a very nice gesture of the restaurant as it creates a somewhat personal and appreciative relationship. During one of our meals at the counter on the right side, we had a great interactive dining experience with the chefs as well.<br><br>Despite G & the G being such an overly hyped restaurant in Chicago, it has a lot to live up to.

Our plates were exchanged out after each course and water glass never went empty. Impressive beer list too. <br>We started with the roasted beet salad. The sardines mixed in added a nice saltiness to the dish. Then we had the Arctic Char. Up next was the fire roasted broccoli. The rice krispies on top added a unique texture that went well with the broccoli. To round out the main meal we had the pork shank. It was crispy and the kimchee butternut squash cut the fattiness and richness of the pork nicely. <br><br>At that point I didn't think I could eat any more, but we decided to get some coffee and the bittersweet chocolate dessert.

I cannot say it was kimchi, but it was the perfect accompaniment for the rich dense, savory pork shank with fresh crispy Indian bread-naan.  Oh yeah, I also loved the goat confit.

Well, you start with a symphony of fatty pig parts found on the pig's face (snout, tongue, cheek, etc.) and you use it to sandwich some crunchy twiggy potatoes. What do you serve under this facial sandwich? A trio of sauces (a tamarind and black garlic sauce, a cilantro oil, and a red wine-maple gastrique). To top off this gluttonous assortment is a runny-ass sunny-side up egg. If you're a pork lover, this will fill that void that can't be filled by even the bacon-iest of bacon. It's that porky. It's perfection.<br><br>It's also relatively affordable. At only $16, you can order yourself a plate (forget sharing). Do this.

That butter spreads so nicely and has a smooth hint of greenery freshness, Dude, what a way to start.<br><br>-=-Scallops in Curry Sauce-=- This looked more like a stew, but it was good. All the crunchy on top made it fun to eat.<br><br>-=-Braised Beef Tongue-=- Looks like salad with a few slices of meat on it, with the meat being a crisp beef tongue. Really I preferred the scallops more to this.<br><br>-=-Shishito Peppers-=- So much parmesan cheese on this, and it made it so good. There was so many peppers in there that maybe 4 or 5 could have enjoyed this plate together. Good filler if you just need substance.<br><br>-=-Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face-=- The most hyped dish and with an equally alluring name, but you can just consider this like cabeza. For those wondering, there's no actual face looking at you. That dinky egg on top hid an equally dinky piece of meat below. It was still good, but not worthy as the grand finale to this meal. You still need to get one though.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The food is delicious. A carnivores delight. The chef is on the cutting edge.

Very well balanced flavor, the mixed ingredients all work together with minimum seasoning.<br><br>Duck tongues is also nice. it is crispy and flavorful. <br><br>The olive you bread has tender crumbs and crispy crust with olive inside. Very tasty. A single serving is small and only good for 2 person for tasting at best.<br><br>The pan roasted halibut has some execution issue. The two piece were not cooked consistently. One was over cooked, while the other one was oaky. The flavor is nice though. <br><br>Grilled baby octopus is the least like dish for me. It is over seasoned with salt and vinegar. Also, it blends all sorts of Asian vegetables in one dish. I think it is trying to do too much in one dish.<br><br>The wood oven roasted pig face is pretty heavy. The flavor has some subtle Chinese dish influence. <br><br>Overall, the dishes are flavorful.

The actual meat had a bit of an aftertaste kick, but if you like livery types of flavor then this might be your dish. I must say the winner of the night was Crispy duck tongues - YUM. The slices of duck tongues were a treat mixed with the some of the pickled veggies. For dessert the miso-butterscotch budino was fantastic. Definitely muted my palette after such a heavy meal.

Came here as a suggestion from multiple friends I didn't look into the place so I was at fault for assuming an early dinner would be an easy thing to accomplish. This place was packed at 6 on a Saturday with a 2hr wait so patience and perseverance plus hope led to landing bar seating.<br><br>Started with cocktails both were great had an old fashion and bolt action (memory may be wrong on the name) and bread order of miso butter and kimchi \"relish\" (quotations appropriate as this is essentially pico de gallo with a goju chang sauce drizzled over the top, not even mixed and I don't know how you get to loosely defining something as kimchi without fermentation or even a type of cabbage) miso butter was perfect and the brioche the same and amazing together and the \"relish\" had good flavor but the cucumber was a bit too pronounced (my personal opinion as I'm focused on spice with kimchi in mind).<br><br>Next was the beet salad that included frisee, green beans, bread crumbs, white anchovy, avocado creme fraiche. The flavor on this was good but the salad was over dressed and the green beans overcooked but oddly some were and some were not but I know it happens so no big deal there my main issue was the white anchovy which I was looking forward to as white anchovy are great so I was eagerly searching but nothing and so I came to the conclusion that they must be apart of the dressing but I knew better as they aren't cheap and they sure deserve more respect than being pureed into a salad dressing and then I found it one piece smaller than the 1/4 sliced beet and that was it so I was left wanting but entrees were next so hopes were high.<br><br>For entrees I ordered the scallop dish which comes with pea tendrils, fava beans, and smoked tomato rhubarb relish (should be called a compote why is relish having issues tonight), and brandade (salted cod & potatoe pureed together). The promise of this dish was so high I mean smoked tomato and rhubarb I was sold but alas the plate came and it was wilted pea tendrils covering everything without a bit of direction or reason so I moved things around and began tasting each component fava beans and pea tendrils under seasoned, brandade salty of course but I expect some control here but maybe it's being left salty was to balance with the under seasoned greens and beans (nope had a salt lick by the time I finished) smoked tomato and rhubarb absolutely amazing not too smokey not too tart it was great, and the scallops were cooked and seasoned perfectly overall I appreciate the direction of the dish but it fell short. <br><br>Second entree my girl (not very experienced in casual fine or fine dining) got the wood oven roasted pig face which comes with tamarind cilantro, red wine maple, potato sticks, and a fried egg. Very nice plating everything looked great so time to dig in and it goes down hill immediately cut into egg and yolk stays still(I chalked that up to possibly too long in the sally or too long waiting under the heat lamp) didn't think it would be that much of a factor but that was until the pig face (assuming cheek based on the size and I'm sure tongue would have been mentioned) it was jerky(even had a two top next to us get the same dish and exclaim how dry theirs was) but she was fine with it and said it tasted good still (refer to my above statement of her lack of experience plus this note of well done steaks are her preference..I still love her) so this was a severe disappointment.<br><br>Dessert save the day please..ordered the dark matter pot de creme which came with sesame spuma, ginger caramel, and sesame brittle this was perfect. Spuma was exactly what you want the flavor was sweet and the sesame was light but present and not too much when combined with the brittle and not lost when combined with the creme and the caramel had a great texture a ginger note. I'd certainly order this again.<br><br>Overall  we were able to enjoy ourselves but it took more effort to do so than is expected due to the acclaim of this establishment but the layout, decor, and music was very comfortable which helped.

Appreciated the pine nuts and the kick of pickled peppers but honestly cauliflower is still cauliflower. Still better than broccoli would have been.<br><br>Seafood - scallops. OMG OMG OMG.

Creamy sauce and potato sticks made it more interesting. Egg could have been runnier. I'm Chinese though, so I was disappointed when I did not see a whole pig face. <br><br>Duck leg - after the pig face, this dish was just like a deja vu. You can definitely tell the ingredients are fresh and top-notch, but the treatment is pretty similar - they seared the dug leg, slow cooked it perfectly so it was tender and juicy (coz the searing locked the juice in) but the sauce was strikingly similar to the pig face sauce.

obviously, one comes to expect that a place so booked must have magnificent food and maybe service to match -- sadly, that was not the case at Girl & the Goat.  Food was mediocre at best and service held no passion.  It was clear that the service team just wanted us in and then out; I left believing that no one in the restaurant actually cared if I enjoyed my experience.<br>     The table settings were a sharing plate per person, a set of silverware, a glass cup, and a napkin.  When we sat down we were told that we had to order everything at once and that our server would course our meal out for us.  We asked if we could order things after each course, but that request was denied.  This was the second red flag of the night; the first being a rude hostess when we showed up early.  We then devised which courses we would order.  We were informed that we should order two per person, so we ordered 3.33 per person (10 courses) since we were eager to try the cuisine of the highly publicly acclaimed Girl & the Goat.<br>     Our first course was warm marinated olives; these were pretty good, but also extremely simple (which was expected and not a problem).  Next came the hamachi crudo with crisp pork belly, chili aioli, and caperberries; this dish was okay, but nothing to write home about.  Next, the squash blossom \"crab rangoon\" with almonds and Chive yogurt; this was another okay dish that tasted pretty much like any other crab rangoon (which is a problem because this place  has a 4.7/5 on opentable with over 6,000 reviews, so the food should be much better than average).  Then came the goat carpaccio with smoked trout roe and olive-maple vinaigrette; this dish was below average -- I've had far superior carpaccio in Michigan, which is, in the culinary sense, a far inferior location to Chicago.  When I eat at a place in Chicago that has 4.7/5 on opentable and requires a three month wait to even get a reservation, I expect that the food will be far superior to Michigan food.  The dish tasted rancid and was not aesthetically appealing.  The onslaught of disappointment was continued by the calamari bruschetta with clam baguette, goat milk ricotta cheese, goat bacon, and green tomato; the calamari in this dish was actually pretty good (though not deserving of a 4.7/5 on opentable), it had a nice chewy texture and a pleasant taste, but the calamari did nothing to enhance the bruschetta; the two ingredients simply did not belong together.  Now it was time for the duck tongues with tuna and black poke, crispy wontons, and piri piri; this dish was good (again, not deserving of a 4.7/5), but it felt like it was missing an essential ingredient.  We felt that the dish would have been complete if it was spicier.  Now, the goat empanadas with miso-blue cheese aioli and squash-apple slaw; again, this dish was good, but certainly not deserving of a 4.7/5 in Chicago, an area that has multiple Michelin star restaurants.  Now, the best dish of the night, the bucatini; this was the only dish that I would actually order again, if for some godforsaken reason I was forced to come back.  The best dish was followed by the worst: the octopus with guanciale, fava beans, pea tips, pistachios, and lemon vinaigrette; this dish tasted like licking an extremely sour grill.  I'd rate this dish a 1/10 (extremely bad).  Our final course was the crisp braised pork shank with buttermilk dressing, grilled spring onion kimchee and naan;

the server described it as a strong ginger ale, but it was on the weaker end of ginger drinks I've had.<br><br>These were the dishes we were able to try:<br><br>Escargot ravioli (with bacon, tamarin-miso sauce) - A nicely balanced dish accompanied by crispy onions, which gave the dish a good textural balance.  The sauce was rich but delicious.  <br><br>Braised beef tongue (with masa, beef vinaigrette, salsa verde) - The beef tongue was tender and paired with some pickled veggies which brought a bright acidity to the dish.  The salsa verde was on the edge seasoning-wise.<br><br>Wood oven roasted pig face (with sunny-side egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine-maple, potato stix) - Our server helped us mix this dish throughly.  The flavor combination was a delicious balance of sweet and savory.  The pig face melted in your mouth.<br><br>Diver scallops (with brown butter kimchee, hazelnut rapini, and avocado) - The kimchee was incredibly salty, but the scallops were nicely prepared and had a good sweetness.  <br><br>Roasted cauliflower (with pickled peppers, pine nuts, mint, and parmesan) - I thought this was a fine dish.  The portion was very generous.  The parmesan made the dish a bit salty.<br><br>Wood fired walter's chicken (with asparagus, rhubarb, green goddess dressing) - <br>The chicken had a bit of a generic barbecue taste but was tender.  Some of the asparagus was deep fried; the other asparagus on the plate was quite bitter.  The bread that accompanied the dish, which seemed like a sort of pita bread, was excellent.  The rhubarb tasted fresh and tart.<br><br>Sugo (with pappardelle, rosemary, and gooseberries) - I wish this dish had more pappardelle, which was tender and had a nice mouthfeel.  The gooseberries were bright and flavorful.  I found the sugo to be too salty; our server described it as a meat sauce, but I would say it was more meat than sauce.  <br><br>Config goat belly (with bourbon butter, lobster and crab, and fennel) - This was perhaps the most disappointing dish of the night.  The goat belly was a bit on the dry side, and the seafood accompaniments were drenched in butter (to the point where you couldn't taste the seafood very well).  <br><br>We were given a sampling of their bavarois, which was a combination of a berry compote, sticky cake, and goat cheese.  I personally dislike goat cheese, so I just sampled the bottom flavors, which I found to be on the sweet side (but the goat cheese might have balanced this out).  <br><br>If we were to come again (which is, I suppose, very unlikely since we're not local), I would have skipped the chicken, goat belly, and sugo for sure.<br><br>We were extremely lucky to be seated right at the pass, which gave us an amazing view of the kitchen.  The chefs we talked to were very friendly and helpful, giving us advice on where to eat in Chicago.  <br><br>Overall, some very good dishes, but many of the plates were over-seasoned, and the meal was not quite as special as I hoped it would be.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/v-G9abR7MuN2vqFRbDx73Q/348s.jpg", "caption": "happy juice (fruity ginger ale)"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/soJ_OSy66_OV2y_o4-EUXw/168s.jpg", "caption": "escargot ravioli"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/B6aChqFzZnTXJ1BtLsEO6Q/168s.jpg", "caption": "beef tongue"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "I was so excited to go here for the first time, and was devastated when 2/5 of my dishes were so unappetizing that they were not even worth eating, and i wasn't even inspired to ravenously finish my dessert.

I made a reservation back in September to celebrate finishing my Masters in Nursing and graduation for mid December. The best reservation I could get for 2 people was for a Thursday night at 10:45pm......and that was 3 months in advance. I wasn't thrilled with the late dinner reservation, so when they asked if we wanted an earlier time slot if it opened up, I said we would take it. Apparently the restaurant took that as \"if an earlier day opened up for an earlier time, that's when the reservation would be\". and failed to communicate that with me completely. So on Tuesday, the week of the reservation, they called to confirm our reservation for Wednesday night for 9:30pm. I was so confused and said, no our reservation was for Thursday, I made this over 3 months ago and it's a big celebration dinner that is been planned far in advance. They basically said that there was nothing they could do, and it was either Wednesday night or nothing. I have been wanting to try this restaurant for YEARS so said 'Ok, we will come in Wednesday instead\". Since I was working that night I had to rush to find a sub last minute so I could make this new reservation. I had to change my work schedule and switch days to accommodate their mistake. <br><br>On Wednesday night, we arrived at 9:30pm for the reservation and the hostesses were not friendly at all. We waited 30 minutes for them to finally sit us for dinner. The hostess walked us to our table, which was basically in the hostess booth. I honestly don't know why this is even a table in the restaurant. My chair was literally touching the hostesses, wasn't even in the main dining room, and should not even be considered a table. I understand they are busy, but so are a lot of other restaurants in the city. If they already knew we had to switch days and wait even longer for the table, could we at least not be in the dining room instead of basically the bar/hostess booth for dinner?!<br><br>I normally do not get bothered by this sort of thing, but not only did they screw up the actual day of the reservation, we had to wait another 30 minutes to sit in the worst spot in the restaurant. After making this reservation 3 months in advance and saying multiple times that it was for a big celebration and special dinner, the staff did nothing. I have lived in Chicago my entire life and this was BY FAR the worst service I have ever had at any Chicago restaurant. I feel like since they are so popular and trendy that they do not care about customer service and they take advantage of that. The hostesses clearly do not communicate. I did not even want to stay after the horrible experience so we just left. I would rather spend a big celebration and my money somewhere that appreciates their customers.

Best spot, just saying--got to see all the action AND we got a few dishes on the house (win!). Service was great, truly friendly and considerate, but let's talk food:<br><br>Portions weren't that big, but I definitely felt stuffed at the end. <br> <br>Bread appetizer: I forgot which one we got, but it one with goat cheese. I thought it was good, but nothing special, so I wouldn't recommend getting this--waste of stomach space<br><br>Beet salad: I'm usually not a fan of creamy salad dressing, but found this one to be yummy. It didn't have the rich/fatty taste, and was refreshing and flavorful. We saw the chefs make the Kohlrabi salad the most, so maybe that salad's the real deal, but the beet one was pretty good regardless.<br><br>Lamb tartare: Delicious, but portion was a bit small. I liked that they put some veggies/greens in there with the meat, it complimented it well. Definitely left me yearning for more. Recommend. <br><br>Pig face: The famous pig face! delicious, creamy, and melt-in-your-mouth. And of course, that fried egg on top just makes everything 100x better. Like a high-end spam, but with a pig tongue/cheek-y taste to it. <br><br>Sauteed green beans (on the house): Cooked with an asian twist, but I found it to be a little too salty. Wasn't anything special.<br><br>Goat loin: Oh my lord, this was seriously heaven in my mouth. Even though by the time this came out I was about to explode from all the prior delicious food, I had one bite and I was like \"Man, I need more of this!\". I would die happy if this was my last meal on earth. Cooked so well, the meat was so smooth and the sauce that came with it complimented it so nicely. Nice and tender, medium-rare-ish. Such flavor, much mouth-gasms. Portion was larger than I had expected, which was a nice surprise. Highly recommend, best thing I ate that night :) <br><br>Desserts: Got the butterscotch miso budino on the house and ordered the rhubarb shortcake. They were good, but I wasn't wow-ed by any of them. I might have put high expectations on dessert though, since the rest of our meal was soooooo good. <br><br>Price: For all of our food and a beer, it was $100 including tax/tip. I was surprised because I thought for the amount we ate, the tab would come out to be over 100. Although it is pricier than your average McDonald's dollar menu meal, I think it's reasonable for a special night out. I'd definitely come back.

We got seated immediately at our table for two on the side that separated from the bar. We were really excited since we had heard all the hype about this place for a couple years now and the thousands of reviews on here. The waitress came right away gave us some recommendations, we got our drinks which were pretty good. And then came the food.... we got the:<br><br>Ham Frites AKA fries in beer batter and ham tasting with some chilli powder i believe. They were were pretty good. Not sure how you can go wrong with fries though so nothing special.<br><br>Italian Sausage Bread ($4): Basically a whole loaf of bread. It tasted like pizza, it was really good. Probably our favorite part. Crispy on the outside with chunks of sausage on the inside and dough. Real good. <br><br>Baby octopus: Well, everyone raved about it and waitress suggested it, and we love octopus. There may have been a total of 2 pieces of baby octopus in there all cut up with a bunch of vegetables and this heavy tangy sauce. Quite disappointed.<br><br>Escargot Ravioli: 4 pieces, weird texture, again,,,nothing special. the sauce was pretty good though we dipped our bread in this sauce. <br><br>The Roasted Cauliflower: just grilled or roasted cauliflower. We definitely needed this after all the carb and probably the only reason we finished it because we downed the bread and fries. but definitely nothing special. It will take you 5 minutes to make the same at home. <br><br>And finally the Pig Face: Fattiest, Greasiest meal of all. Not sure how anyone eats this, It was SOO FATTY! comes with an egg on top and they say mix it all together, definitely tastes like pure oil and putting a piece of lard in my mouth. <br><br>The waitress noticed our displeased faces on the pig face and was kind enough to take it off our bill. <br><br>Overall, I was incredibly disappointed by the food and would give it a 2, just because the bread was good and everything else was edible just not WOW I gotta go back. The drinks were a 3 or 4.

Yes, I have an uncommon and overzealous love for all things eggplant, but I am also very picky about how it is prepared. Most places like to bread it and fry it, which masks the delicate flavors. Stephanie doesn't take this easy way out... I don't know how she preps it, but it is a perfect foil for the crunchy and creamy fritters. <br><br>Another fave is the green beans/string beans. She uses some very strong fish sauce in this dish, so sometimes it can be a bit salty. But... oh la la, i love the flavors. Be careful, because I think it is one of those dishes that can end up burning your mouth if you eat too much of it (like salt and vinegar chips).<br><br>Yeah. I know. Neither of my favorite dishes is a meat or goat dish. Those are great too, but these were the two dishes that knocked my socks off. <br><br>ps. The bread with the spreads ... so good.

We were complimentary given green beans which we probably should've ordered anyway. It was a plentiful serving, so we ate them throughout the meal with smiles on our faces. Next up, from Sous Chef Andrea's suggestion, we had the halibut. It was in this blueberry compote type sauce and it truly melted in your mouth. Each meal promptly followed the next, so the goat empanadas were up. The avocado base really added to the heaviness of the goat. As a meal finale, we ordered the pig face. I wasn't a huge fan as I prefer leaner cuts of meat, but my boyfriend probably would've bathed himself in it daily if he could've. The amazing chefs somehow convinced us to order desert, so we had the butterscotch bead pudding with candied pineapple and bacon, and they also brought out a complimentary rice pudding with rhubarb.

I'll just say: It was everything I never expected it to be. <br><br>The first time I ever went to G&tG was actually in summer of 2011, with a foodie friend visiting from out of town. I'm ashamed to confess I was barely conscious and severely hungover, and more or less merely a begrudging local companion to my visiting buddy. It didn't help that everything said friend wanted to order was of the heavy, greasy and beefy variety, which is a strict no-no for post-alcohol recovery-mode Irene. <br><br>Fast forward to last month, when Boyfriend and I flew out to Chicago so we could check out my old grad-school stomping grounds. I wasn't terribly enthusiastic about getting out to G&tG, given the notoriously long waits (we were going for Sunday dinner, too) and my general dislike for traveling to locales west of the river and not on the Red line. The night threatened to start off badly, especially after we got to the restaurant, and a real asshat at the bar was hogging two empty seats, claiming he was saving them for a friend -- two hours later, when we left, those chairs stayed empty. <br><br>But then a bright light shot through the murky night. Some couch seats opened up just then, and our waitress, a total team player, quickly ushered us into them, telling us, \"Don't mind that jerk.\" We immediately started the food coming. <br><br>Oh my god. The pairings. The textures. THE FLAVORS. SO MUCH FLAVORS. SO GOOD FLAVORS. The duck tongue: crispy, chewy and savory. The confit goat belly: falling-apart juicy with creamy balancing sauce. Our dessert: something I'd never heard of (apparently it was Izard's mother's recipe), but reallyreally tasty without going overboard on either the sweet nor the salt. <br><br>I honestly think my favorite dish of the night was the grilled baby octopus -- and not just because the waitress brought it to us for free to \"make up\" for the douchebag from earlier. Just the way the chewy octopus paired with the soft beans paired with the crunchy pistachios paired with the smoky guanciale paired with the dash of soy or whatever it was she used to season the dish was... genius.

I have never experienced that another restaurant but it was kind of fun! It's a great way to start the meal. The different toppings and butter made it fun and it's a good size for 2 - 3 people to share.<br><br>B<br> - Goat Liver - This is a HUGE portion in my opinion. You get five crumpets which are like five big biscuits and about half a cup of the goat liver puree.

What?!). <br><br>The location is a bit random and awkward to get to (why doesn't that bridge have better pedestrian crossings?), but the restaurant itself is huge and industrial-feeling (including a small sidewalk patio), yet with a homey comfortable vibe that seemed to suit everything from a fancy date to a casual bite with friends (I even saw some kids there, so I guess it's good for families as well?). Our waiter was attentive and welcoming, and helped us navigate the menu. <br><br>The drink menu has some cool cocktails and some nice local beers, so we tried a few to start and were pretty happy with our selections (try the Cross of Gold beer). The food menu is comprised of small plates divided into a few different categories (bread, meat, seafood, veg, goat, dessert). Between three of us, the waiter recommended we order six dishes, so we started off sharing the Summertom homemade bread and then each picked one dish for the table and one dish to primarily keep for ourselves, including: kohlrabi salad, spring onion potstickers, squash blossom crab rangoons, halibut, goat empanadas, pig face, and then for dessert, the Thai basil chocolate brownie dessert to split between all 3.<br><br>I doubt you can go wrong here, because I didn't eat a single bite all night that I didn't think was absolutely delicious/fairly unique/well-executed, but the standout for me was the halibut (which happen to be my 'personal' dish)... the fish was cooked to perfection, and the sauce and accompaniments were so out of this world that I physically had to stop myself from licking the dish after the food was gone (I have no idea what was in that sauce, but it was very umami and very addicting). I was so distracted by how amazing the food was that I didn't even think to take any pics or record the menu, and barely remembered to take a pic of the receipt so I could remember exactly what we ordered (and how damn cheap it was compared to some other lessor restaurants I've been to). I don't think the three of us even really spoke much, we were so focused on how good everything was and I think the extent of our conversation was like, \"OMG try this!\" and \"holy wow, that's fricken good\". <br><br>So, yeah, Stephanie Izard definitely won Top Chef for a reason. I was rooting for her during her season, and now I'm an even bigger fan. If you're a also fan of hers, or Top Chef, or awesome food, or even just cool restaurants in general, you need to come here ASAP.<br><br>Pro-tip: arrive just prior to 4:30 when it opens (early bird special, what what) and you're likely to be able to secure a table without waiting months for a reservation.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "One of my favorite meals!  I've been wanting to eat here every time I visit Chicago but I can never get a reservation.

So far going to Girl and the Goat was our dreamed place for special occasions as to reserve a table is close to magic. It was my b-day and my hubby booked a table a month in advanced. We were so excited! We got our seating at ... the kitchen counter! For the whole birthday dinner experience I haven't seen my hubby's face or enjoyed the meal but I saw everything what was going in the kitchen. And that was NOT what I came for. Do not get me wrong I enjoy cooking myself but when I am at the restaurant I want to enjoy food: its presentation and taste. Talking about food: Roasted Beets Salad was good but the beets were not roasted. They were cooked only and I do not know if they were cooked by restaurant or bought as bulk from somewhere (judging by the way how a female cook was dealing with them - they looked like purchased in bulk) I am a health coach and a cook myself and beets are part of my cooking experience since childhood so I know what I am talking about. And Kohlrabi Salad had crumbled goat cheese which was not stated on the menu and it was a deal breaker for my hubby. Pig's face was good but seeing it prepared for multiple times while we were waiting for our order, it took its magic away and it didn't taste the same. The female cooks were very skilled in preparing salads and deserts but I wondered why there was not a single female working in the meat section? Is there a reason for that? The whole placement made me think: would I truly enjoy cooking if I would repeat preparation of a single dish for 400 times a day? The only thing what I can remember from this outing is the look and business of the kitchen. Girl and The Goat - you TOTALLY KILLED THE MAGIC and PLEASURE of EATING OUT! Next time, we will consider going for special occasions to some local joints like Autre Monde or Cucina Paradisco where we can always enjoy the great food without seeing how it is being prepared for multiple times. It would be for the same price and great culinary experience. The word DISAPPOINTMENT comes to my mind when I think about my recent dinner at Girl and the Goat and it is a shame as it supposed to be a fun b-day dinner outing!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ram7Dzuo3_-bvG_m4_fMkw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Killing the Magic - my slight right view at our table - first salad and deserts station, next one Pig's face station :("}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/awpief5cGro6elxD292UtA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Killing the Magic - the view in front of me at our table at my disappointing experience at Girl and The Goat"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "I love this place, I just wish it was a little more affordable, but maybe next time I'll try little goat.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Another great dinner and drinks here.

Trust me, it's delicious. I think I sighed in contentment at least a dozen times. A couple of folks at our table were hesitant, but I think they were won over by this delicious meal.  (If you could have seen Theresa L sigh and put her head in her hands--I think she was won over!)<br><br>We did get all four deserts to try as all--Red Tea creme brulee, a chocolate cake with raspberry gelato, a quatros leches cake with fresh blueberries , and a goat cheese cheesecake. They were all very good but my favorite was the creme brulee--I'm a sucker for a good brulee and this was so creamy with a nice hint of tea.  The least favorite was the leches cake as it didn't have enough \"leches\" for us to think about a fabulously moist cake. <br><br>The space is gorgeous.  Sleek, dark, loud--but in a good conversation carry kind of way.

I am currently living in Munich, Germany - but I am originally from Chicago. Girl and the Goat opened a little before my fiancee and I moved to Germany, and unfortunately we were not lucky enough to get reservations prior to our depature. HOWEVER! This summer we were back for a visit, so as soon as we booked our flights I went to OpenTable to see if I could get a reservation.

Please keep in mind that I made this reservation for 4 people, approximately 5 months before the reserevation!<br><br>Anywho, our server was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. She explained that we should get 7-8 plates to split between the four of us. After looking at the menu, we did not need any arm pulling to push us to order 7-8 plates - almost everything looked exteremly delicious. <br><br>We ordered raw oysters, green beans, goat belly, chickpea fritters, scallops, pig face, fried zucchini flowers, and lamb stuffed calamari... as well as two bottles of wine :). <br><br>The oysters were beautifully prepared and melted in your mouth. I did not get any briney taste - which is one thing that I missed a little, but the garnish of ginger and other spices made up for that. <br><br>The green beans... HOLY MOLY - so delicious. They are served in this sauce that is delicious enough to want to bathe in. We later found out (at the end of our meal) that this sauce is also sold by the bottle - naturally, we bought some to take with us ;).<br><br>Out of all the dishes we had, I would have to say that the confit goat belly was the most disappointing. On paper, it looks absolutely delicious, but when you tasted it... well, it was strangely sweet. Although it did not say on the menu, it tasted like there was vanilla added to the dish - which mixed with the bits of lobster was actually off putting. <br><br>The chickpea fritters were probably my favorite dish of the night (or at least tied with the green beans and the pig face). They were served with a variety of pickled veggies - which my friends (who had been there before) said were different from when they were there last... so I assume they change the veggies based on the season. <br><br>The wood fired scallops were cooked to perfection, and also were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. <br><br>The zucchini blossoms were relatively standard... nothing to write home about when compared to the other dishes. <br><br>The Pig Face.... mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. What an amazingly tastebud frenzy of excitement! Everyone needs to try it. I don't really want to go into too much detail about the dish, because everyone should go in not knowing what to expect. However, know this, it is NOT an actual face. <br><br>The lamb stuffed calamari were good... calamari were not over cooked, and everything was seasoned nicely. <br><br>All in all it was a GREAT culinary experience, and I would most definitely go back again... and again.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Don't come here if you're plan A was Au Cheval but they're too busy and will be a long wait.

They have a delicious reason why. Straight from the oven, their Potato Bread is to die for, it  comes with a potato cream  spread and also a garlic butter spread.<br><br>**Diver Scallop: Yum-Azing!!!! Perfect texture with the perfect sear. If there's anything I have learned from cooking reality shows, it's that only a real chef that knows how to do a scallop right.

The peppers has a little bit of spicy kick to it so it's good to wake up the appetite with one.<br><br>**String Beans w/ Fish Sauce: OMG, the fish sauce and the nuts on top, this dish is addictive. You will keep popping those beans in your mouth. The fish sauce adds a little bit of tartness to the string beans. Another great plate to add a little bit of vegetable to your menu.<br><br>**Escargot Ravioli: Must admit, I'm not an escargot kind of girl. But it sounded so interesting on the menu that I just had to try it. It was interesting for sure. Ravioli usually come with a soft filling, but the chewy escargot inside the ravioli gave it a different level of pasta experience.

I also requested to be seated at the chef's table if possible mentioning that we were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday.<br><br>We arrived a little bit early. The decor is very pretty inside with a nice ambiance. We sat at the bar and ordered some drinks until our table was ready. I wasn't sure if the restaurant received my request via OpenTable since it was never confirmed so I was super happy when the waitress led us to the chef's table and then wished my boyfriend a happy birthday (without me mentioning anything). It was nice to know that they try to accommodate your requests and even made a note that we were there for a special occasion.<br><br>Awesome service!!! Our waitress was fantastic, very friendly and prompt. She recommended that we get about 4-5 dishes for us which turned out to be the perfect amount of food.<br><br>The chef's table was also a great experience - you're seated right in front of the kitchen so you can see all the dishes being put together. <br><br>The food was amazing - seriously one of the best meals I have ever eaten so far. We ordered the shishito peppers, grilled baby octopus, pig face (that egg!) and pork shank. We also received a free dish - escargot ravioli. I don't think I would have ever ordered it on my own accord since I never tried escargot before that dish but I would definitely recommend it and probably order it again. At the end of the meal, our waitress brought out a mini dessert dish with a candle for my boyfriend's birthday which was really thoughtful (and delicious).<br><br>I can't pick a favorite dish because I enjoyed all of them so much!

Needless to say, I immediately went on OpenTable to see if they had any reservations open in the near future and luckily I was able to find a table for 2 on a Wednesday at 8:15. Not too bad considering I saw some reservations for 11:45 PM (who would even eat that late?!). When we got to the restaurant, we were seated immediately at a small table, which was a little too close to our neighbors for my liking but it didn't ruin the experience at all. <br><br>For drinks, my boyfriend and I decided to try some beer and wine that we've never had before, so I went with a glass of the Montepulciano/Sangiovese and being from Baltimore, he chose the Stillwater Cellar Door. They were both really great and complemented the meal well. <br><br>Since I did extensive research on Yelp, I already knew what we wanted to order coming into the night and decided on the sautéed green beans, scallops, pig face, and confit goat belly. We were also going to order some oysters, but decided to nix them because I wanted to enjoy each dish without being too overly full and make it to dessert! I'm glad we made that decision because it turned out to be the perfect amount of food. The sautéed green beans came out first and they were delicious. Being Vietnamese, I loved the fish sauce vinaigrette, which was an interesting spin because it somehow did not remind me of Asian flavors. I also loved all the shallots and cashews that were in the dish and I would definitely order it again. The scallops were a little disappointing though because the dish only came with 2 and I couldn't really taste the uni in the sauce. Next came the infamous pig face, which I thought was good, but a little too fatty for my taste. My boyfriend found the texture of the pig face to be too mushy and wanted more potato stix for the crunch and contrast. Last came the goat belly, which I was a little nervous to try to be honest. I've tried some weird things before, but I've never enjoyed them because I kept reminding myself what I was eating. However, I came in with an open mind and boy was I glad I did! The goat belly turned out to be our favorite dish because the meat was tender, but crispy on the outside and leaner than the pig face which was very welcomed. The crab and lobster that it was topped off with was also a great complement and I really enjoyed the surf and turf aspect of that dish. <br><br>For dessert, we shared the miso-butterscotch budino, which was the perfect end to the meal. The budino was nice and moist and I loved the candied cashews and butterscotch. My boyfriend laughed at me and asked if I was going to lick the bowl clean, but hey, can't a girl just want to scrape out the last of the butterscotch? <br><br>Overall, the meal was everything I'd hoped it would be with great drinks, food, and atmosphere. After coming home, I later found out that they were celebrating Girl & the Goat's 4th birthday, which made sense since I thought the Happy Birthday banner above our table must have been leftover from a party.

Went here when I was a vegetarian and still loved everything!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "First off: Didn't make a reservation five months ago before you knew you were going to be in Chicago or even wanted to dine at Girl & the Goat? Well, then show up about 15 minutes BEFORE the restaurant opens, and they will seat you right away once they're actually opened. You can also grab seats in the lounge or at the bar where food is still served, but honestly, get there early, and you can still score an actual table, even on a weekend. Just make sure you are there EARLY because you will not be the only one trying to do this. Still, as long as you're there by the time they open, I think you should be good.<br><br>Secondly: The food is quite good, but portions are SMALL and pricey. They recommend 2-3 dishes per person (to be shared amongst the table), and that doesn't include bread or starters. This can really add up, but hey, it's fine dining, so what do you expect.<br><br>Third: As for specific recommendations, I'll just start from the beginning and go through everything we ate. We tried the \"ghums n' roses\" bread. Skip it. The bread was too hard and crusty, and the spreads were nothing to write home about. The table next to us ordered a different type of bread, I think maybe the onion, and it looked WAY better. I was simply suckered into the ghums n' roses bread by the enticement of rosemary honey butter, but it did not live up to expectations. The oysters, however, were good, but they were oysters. Nothing above and beyond really. Next up were the duck tongues. Decent but not my favorite thing we ate. Next was the arctic char. Now THIS, on the other hand, was my favorite thing we ate, at least outside of dessert anyway. This was cooked and seasoned and accompanied so well. I wish we had ordered two! Definite must try. The halibut, however, which came recommended by the server, was a complete letdown. Very bland and unflavorful. Go with the arctic char instead. Confit goat belly was also a bit disappointing. It was very citrusy actually, and while it was tasty, there was more lobster and crab than actual goat belly. It was good, but I just wish the proportions had been better. Goat loin was tasty too. Slightly gamey, but not too bad. Pretty tasty. And then we got to the pig face - one of the main reasons we came here. It's supposed to be eaten as a sort of hash, with the egg, pig face, and other accompaniments mixed together. The men really enjoyed this, but I'm not big on really fatty pieces of meat (I prefer leaner meats) so this was not my cup of tea. Finally, dessert. The miso-butterscotch budino is an absolute MUST. It's basically a butterscotch pudding/flan-like dessert, but it's the bacon toffee pieces that absolutely make this dish. You need to ensure that there is crunch in every bite, and you will seriously swoon. Delicious. The plantain cake was good too, but it just couldn't hold a candle to the incredible budino.<br><br>Finally: Valet is $11, which for Chicago isn't too bad. Street parking in the area was kind of confusing, so I'd just recommend going for the valet. The restaurant itself is nice but laidback. You can dress up or you can wear jeans. Unless you're in tattered rags, I can't see them turning anyone away, but perhaps at least make yourself look presentable. Oh, and the cutest part of the restaurant? The doggie bag has a picture of a goat with a doggie hat/mask on. Very clever.<br><br>Overall: I would definitely recommend trying it for an experience, but I will say that it wasn't everything and more than I expected it to be. Good food, but be careful what you pick, and expect to pay a pretty penny.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fLQ-w85hPS4pimbyj7pa9g/348s.jpg", "caption": "Pan roasted arctic char"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BpIaEDTfEoVJ5ybK-SGPow/168s.jpg", "caption": "Duck tongues"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/v2mxTyZrknHmg_6bh2-HbA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Goat loin"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "When I tell people I'm going to Chicago, everyone always says go to Girl and the Goat.  Finally on my fourth visit to Chicago I've finally gone, and I was NOT disappointed!  For the quality of food you get, the prices are reasonable, and I love being able to do family style and try various dishes.  It's conveniently located off the Pink and Green lines.  One thing if you haven't made a reservation (which I highly recommend) is that you can sit in the bar/lounge area pretty easily without a reservation.<br><br>There was literally not one dish I disliked.  In fact, they were all above and beyond delicious.  We started with cocktails which were all fabulous.  I got one the Innovator, which tasted like Christmas and was perfect for a cooler day in Chicago.  We started with the johnny applecheese bread which was SO good.  We kept the cheese butter and malt oil for dipping later (a wise choice might I add).  Our server was very friendly and helpful - she was right in recommending 1-2 dishes per person, so we ended up with 6 dishes (not including the bread, and dessert).  We opted for the roasted cauliflower, the hamachi crudo, the grilled baby octopus, the pig face, pork shank, and goat confit.  Our server also gave us a complimentary sauteed green beans which was incredible.  I wish I could choose a favorite dish, but literally every one had so many layers of flavor, that I really can't choose.  The roasted cauliflower had an Asian flare to it, even though they specifically told us they only added pine nuts, pickled peppers, and mint.  All the vegetable dishes we got were on the larger side, and the hamachi crudo was probably the smallest dish (and the most underwhelming.  NOT saying it's bad, but I guess that might be my least favorite of the bunch).  The octopus was perfectly grilled (had a small amount of char, not rubbery in the slighest), and the pig face and pork shank were so tender.  Fall apart off the bone with a crispy outside.  Really can't go wrong.  Just when I thought that we couldn't have any more delicious food, we finished off with teh chocolate peanut butter cake/ice cream and these FANTASTIC donut holes.  I don't think I can have a normal donut hole again.<br><br>5 stars for sure for this place.  I would love to come back when I'm visiting Chicago!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "For all the hype this place gets, the food is not that phenomenal.

The bread is worth the $8 because the spreads make it taste so fancy and gourmet.  I loved both the tortone and brioche.  The kohlrabi salad was very nice, though much lighter and best as a starter.

We took the suggestion and practically licked the plate clean.  The escargot ravioli was the only thing I probably wouldn't order again. You get 4 ravioli under a bit of sauce and veggies, and while it's a really fun concept, it actually just tastes like escargot inside some pasta.

Basically a jowl prepared oven roasted with a sunny side up egg on top. As all of the reviews have stated this dish is amazing. Perhaps the best single dish we have had anywhere.

Pork shank - I'm extremely disappointed how full we are were that we actually had a few bites of the shank left. We didn't do the pork shank justice because we didn't devour it like we did with other dishes but if it came out first, you betcha.

It would be another 45 minutes or so to wait for a table. So we waited in the restaurant and sat down at the lounge area. My determination to eat the Pig Face would not be denied. The hostess grabbed us about an hour later and proceeded to take us to....a communal table? That was unexpected for sure. No matter, I was starving and didn't want to make a fuss about having our own table. On to the food!<br><br>Warm Apple Pistachio Ginger Bread: Initially we didn't order their bread. Didn't want to fill real estate up with unnecessary items. But seeing virtually everyone else around us with a loaf of bread at their table, we had to try one of their in-house made breads. Great choice with the sweet jewels of apple and the nutty crunch of the pistachios. And it was WARM! It should be a sin to serve cold bread ever.<br><br>Grilled Baby Octopus, Guanciale, Wax Beans, Romano Beans, Radish, Pistachio-Lemon Vinaigrette: The \"salad\" course we chose. Tender, slightly smoky junior cephalopods. It was a symphony in a dish.<br><br>Grilled Rainier Oysters, Goat Mignonette, Goat Jus: Plump, juicy oysters sitting in a dark, amber goat jus sprinkled with the goat mignonette. It was a shame there were only 4 to an order. I could have devoured a dozen on my own.<br><br>Chickpea Fritters, Pickled Red Onions, Stewed Chick Peas, Crave Brother's Mozzarella: This was solid, but not spectacular. Perhaps the addition of a meat protein would take the dish to the stratoshere. May I suggest bacon?<br><br>Sweet n' Sour Cod Cheeks, Bacon, Potato Aioli, Tempura Broccoli: An Asian-like dish. The cod cheeks dissolved in your mouth. I'm a proponent of frying foods to make them better. So the crispy tempura broccoli was a hit for me.<br><br>Wood Oven Roasted \"Pig Face\", Sunny Side Egg, Tamarind, Cilantro, Potato Stix: The item everyone raves about. They take all the meat from the pig's face and form it into a roasty, toasty disk of porcine goodness. The addition of a fried sunny side egg was like guilding the lily but I wasn't complaining. If you're a pork lover, this is the dish for you.<br><br>Pear Wonton, Parsnip Purée, Pineapple Sweet and Sour, Candied Ginger, Tamarind Stracciatella: For dessert, a perfect end to the meal. Numerous textures and temperatures on the plate. My palate was surprised with the crunch of the wonton and candied ginger, the soothing coolness of the stracciatella, and the delightful brightness of the pineapple. <br><br>The only complaint I had was when we were sat by the hostess she said we had to be done by 7:30PM because a big party was going to take over the whole communal table at that time. When we left our table, there was no big party taking over our table. Even so, a new party of 2 sat across from us as we were enjoying our dessert. Our dinner would have been even more enjoyable had we not felt the need to rush a bit to finish before that 7:30PM deadline.<br><br>I will definitely be back.

Goat Blue Bread with fig butter and fennel onion jam ($4): You might be thinking... who pays for bread?

But the very thin fries here were completely OVERFRIED- to the point where fries become translucent because it's so drenched with oil. To top it off (literally), the fries were sprinkled with this grainy, powder-like version of ham (kind of like pulverized bacon). It was SO salty, we couldn't finish it. <br><br>3. Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face ($16): FAVORITE - there is a reason why there are so many reviews for the pig face - in the dish, there is a pig face, crispy potato stix, with tamarind and cilantro topped with the sunny side egg. Everything needs to be mixed up and eaten in one bite... and WOW Absolutely heavenly and perfection in your mouth. I could eat like 3 of these myself. forreals :}<br><br>4. Crisp Braised Pork Shank ($25): This is one of their bigger portions of the meal which was a very tender, meat-falling-off-bone shank, that came with a slight sweet/spicy butternut squash-shittake kimchee, creamy buttermilk dressing, and hot puffy naan. There was an array of flavors and textures that just played together quite well. By this point, we were tooo full but it was still nice to try. <br><br>5. Confit Goat Belly with bourbon butter, lobster/crab, and fennel ($19): Confit means that the meat is fried in its own fat. So.... Of course, that sounds appetizing! Ah, I dont even know how to start describing this one. It had the most INTERESTING combination of sweetness from the lobster/crab, with the tang from the fennel and herbs. It was the most \"fresh-tasting\" savory dessert I've ever had. Definitely a must-try! <br><br>General comments:<br>Cons: Price and Parking - Most of the dishes were quite salty... some more bearable than others. I would definitely want to try other dishes but coming here our meal for 2 came out to ~$90 with tax and tip. Price is always an issue but eating fancy only happens every once in a while!

My partner and I waited almost FOUR HOURS for a table. I called about a half hour prior to arriving (around 6:30 PM) to see how long the wait time was and the hostess quoted about an hour and a half, but noted, \"It may change depending on when you arrive.\" Granted, we were requested to hang around the bar/lounge area to try and get seated there (first come, first serve type deal), but we figured an hour and a half wait wouldn't be so bad if we went to the brewery across the street for a few beers. WRONG - that time turned into four hours, in which we were hating our lives.<br><br>Finally, 10 PM rolls around and we finally get a phone call saying our table is ready.<br><br>Ordered the hamachi crudo, cape cod mussels, beef short ribs, braised pork shank, and the goat belly, which was their special of the day.<br><br>Hamachi, short ribs, and goat belly were A+. Hamachi was melt-in-your-mouth fresh; short ribs were juicy and super tender; the goat belly was nicely cooked with lobster chunks and a light, buttery sauce which really brought out the flavor of the meat.<br><br>The mussels were a nice size, but cooked in a very run-of-the-mill vinaigrette recipe and not cleaned properly considering I ate chunks of sand out of some. I also got lucky and ate the one that was starting to go bad.<br><br>The pork shank was tender, a nice quality cut; but was super salty. I love fried things but wasn't expecting it to be THAT salty, considering pork/pork skin is already naturally flavorful. Luckily, our waiter was very understanding when we gave him our feedback and he took it back so we weren't charged for it.<br><br>I'd go back again to try other things, but not if I'm expecting another four hour wait - for that price point and quality I'd rather spend some time at Joe's for some impeccably delicious (and fresher) seafood and steak.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Long wait to be seated; but worth it.

This was such an amazing experience; you could feel the heat of the wood burning grill while watching the chefs work diligently to to churn amazing dish after amazing dish and are able to interact with them (as is Chef Izard, they were such a friendly, down-to-Earth group of people).<br><br>Our entire meal was fantastic. Virtually everything on the menu seemed enticing and we wanted to try it all; as such we ended up ordering far more than our server recommended and it all was so outstanding we did not leave a morsel. The biggest highlight was the fried duck tongue (if you are squeamish about organ meats this is the perfect entry dish; if you had not read what it was on the menu you would never know you were eating tongue and would just fall in love with the flavors and textures). Other favorites on the night included the melt-in-your-mouth goat loin, the decadent chickpea fritters and the miso butterscotch dessert with the most heavenly pork toffee. <br><br>The two biggest complaints I generally hear about Girl & the Goat revolve around the food being too salty at times or the dishes being too busy. After three meals here I have experienced only a single dish to be too salty for my palate (and I normally am fairly averse to very salty foods). I also love that Chef Izard is daring with combining unlikely ingredients together and developing extra layers of flavor; sure a lot of dishes are rich but to me she melds ingredients masterfully, elevating the dishes and making them unique without taking anything away. The only slight negatives I can conjure for Girl & the Goat would be that during my meals where I was not at the chef's counter the regular tables are rather close together and the dining room on the noisy side - while the ambiance manages to be nice with an air of elegance alongside the energy, it is not quite on par with the cuisine that is undoubtedly worthy of top notch fine dining fare. Likewise the service while friendly is not quite as polished or personable as some of Chicago's other elite venues. <br><br>Girl & the Goat despite no longer being a new venue is still packed on a daily basis and deservedly so; this is a venue where the experience matches if not exceeds the hype. The more of Chef Izard's cuisine I consume the more impressed I become and she definitely has evolved into one of my favorite chefs. In 2013 Michelin made amends and starred some deserving but previously snubbed restaurants; now Girl & the Goat is Chicago's best restaurant that is not starred (and is superior to quite a few that are); let's hope that Michelin finally awards Chef Izard a well earned star this fall. <br><br>Follow me on Twitter: @Goof_2", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SjCKda7IAEOLH23RfhgdNA/168s.jpg", "caption": "View from Chef's Table"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/E1QuaudRHJz3V2X1gb7IVg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Duck Tongue"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "I don't think people still need reviews on this place anymore judging by the wait times and how far in advanced it's booked out.

In the final tally, the goat falls pretty far from featured element: it operates almost solely at the margins, a background and not a backbone.  It's like a raw-meat dish for people who don't like raw-meat; a carpaccio for diners who'd like to taste all the flavors but the carpaccio.<br><br>-- Octopus: Parts of this cephalopod were very well grilled, but others were too small and (thus) too burned (Coetzee would say this is where \"burned\" becomes \"burnt\").  The haricot vert tossed into things was too al dente for the mélange; the bitter, roasted lettuce--and I usually really enjoy grilled or roasted leafy greens--detracted rather than added, accentuating the pieces if octopus that were burnt.  All together another dish--like the goat carpaccio--that by being too much ends up not enough.<br><br>-- Escargot ravioli: This was at least very tasty, with succulent escargot, wrapped in a well-rendered ravioli dough, served on a nice subtle-yet-hearty, rich-but-not-thick sauce.  The onion-crunch topping was also a nice textural touch that enhanced the bite of the ravioli, and it functioned well in the flavor-matrix of the sauce, pasta, and filling.  Yet, even this dish was marred: four snail-stuffed ravioli for fifteen dollars, when--as good as they were--I could eat a full plate of the best escargot in Chicago at Watershed for $11.  Or, if I just happen to be on that stretch of Randolph, I could head to Maude's for likewise-excellent escargot, much better drinks, and a lyonnaise salad that blows any item I had from Girl & the Goat decidedly away.<br><br>To top it off, our server was a bit lame, and a bit more than pushy.<br><br>How sad.  I had been so eager to try this place.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Really good, everything is very heavy I would suggest going with a group to split items, not because they are large but because a couple bites are all you need", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Superb.

But we definitely thought the Four in the Same was the best cocktail, refreshing, citrusy, slightly bitter, not too sweet. A really good drink for the meal ahead.<br><br>We started off with one of the bread options that vary depending on the day called the aMAIZing and as corny as it was (giggle), it really was amazing. The bread was so fresh, so warm, and stuffed with a layer of gooey cheese and spinach. It would have been completely fine on its own but it was accompanied with two delicious sauces, a mole and an avocado creme fraiche. I could have just had this for my meal and been completely content.<br><br>We moved on to one of the specials of the evening, a shrimp ceviche with Malaysian style chips. The flavors were harmonious, not too acidic, the shrimp superbly flavorful and fresh. It worked so well with the chips which had their own unique flavor. But my friend and I discovered that the ceviche was brought to an entirely new level when paired with a bit of the mole from the bread. That was heaven.<br><br>We also got the roasted cauliflower which was simple yet good. I love the flavor cauliflower gets when roasted or fried already but this dish added a bit more complexity with its pickled peppers and cheese.<br><br>We ended our savory journey with the confit goat belly, which is a small portion but extremely rich. Paired with lobster and crab that all have been basted and/or poached in the bourbon butter, you definitely couldn't have too much. The goat, lobster, and crab were all flavorful but I felt it was a bit too rich for my tastes. The fennel and microgreen salad however was the highlight giving that much needed levity and tart flavor to cut the heaviness of the dish.<br><br>Wanting to leave off on a sweet note, we ordered the chocolate cake with thai-chili gelato. This dish had so many different textures and temperatures. The cake was rich, moist, and warm. The thai-chili gelato was chocolate based but not too spicy only leaving you with a subtle burn at the end. There were also pomegranate seeds and cocoa nibs for added crunch. There was even marshmallow fluff for sweetness and some milk stout to bring it all together. However, I felt there were way too many components in the dish and altogether, they were not necessarily harmonious. The stout was definitely lost from all the other stronger flavors and added to this odd lukewarm temperature in the dish. The flavors that stood out came from the cake, gelato, and marshmallow fluff. That said, we still finished it but I think it needed a bit more contrast or varied flavors given the amount of components.<br><br>All in all, this was an amazing meal and definitely a spot I would come again when I come back to Chicago.

The bread the thick and does taste like broccoli cheese. The mushroom soup \"spread\" is heavenly. I'd love to have this all day, every day.<br><br>Cauliflower - very great play on some different flavors. I can see why this is so popular; it's a solid vegetable dish and different from a basic cauliflower dish.<br><br>Escargot Ravioli - the miso-tamarind sauce is great, but where was the bacon? And the actual ravioli didn't taste like anything - literally it was like I was chewing on dough. The ravioli needed to have it's own flavor, especially stuffed with Escargot. It shouldn't be carried by the sauce.<br><br>Goat Belly - Surprisingly, Goat Belly is not at all like pork belly - it's drier and more like a brisket. It was nice to find chunks of lobster in the sauce, but the flavor didn't really stand out. This dish was pretty unassuming.<br><br>Pig Face - The meat is more like pork belly and is cooked very well - the pork is super tender (or fatty?!). Nothing was wrong with the dish, but like a few others, the flavor was just kind of dull. I did like the potato stix though! I have a sneaky suspicion people like this dish because of it's name. <br><br>Dessert was a miso-butterscotch budino - this was delicious and I don't even crave sweets or really like butterscotch! It was a perfect balance of custard and bread-pudding-like texture. I couldn't really tell what was bacon or pineapple, but I think the flavors just all complimented each other so well that it tasted like one cohesive dish.<br><br>In writing this review, I think I've realized what my general issue is with Girl & the Goat: the flavors are great and creative, but a little dull. I could use a little more flavor explosion like I got with the bread.

The flavor marrying with other ingredients, like the hummus, made it a successful dish. Goat was tender, not gamey, but there is a slight whiff of it. It's not goat unless there's a whiff of game. <br><br>Chickpea fritters: heaven on the palate, like a Belgium truffle chocolate or a genache melting in your mouth.

The duck was also a perfect complement to the dish. This was one of my favorites.<br><br>Goat cheese tortellini: Another solid dish. The stuffing was rich and decadent. The pasta was made and cooked perfectly.<br><br>Woodoven roasted Pig face: Another favorite. Crisp pork and the egg was perfectly over easy and it does make a difference. Don't underestimate the egg. The pork itself is a bit salty, but that's what the egg and maple sauce are there for. It wasn't meant to eat deconstructed, but I tried it anyway.<br><br>Goat cheese cheesecake: Oh...my...GOODNESS!

The gluten-free bread was really good.<br><br>For dessert we had the budino, which was okay.  The decaf coffee was really good.  On the whole, the great food more than offset the problematic host/hostess crew.  The food was quite memorable, I would definitely come back if we come out this way again.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "We came in town for my bachelorette weekend, and the only thing I knew I 100% do was visit this restaurant.

The service was perfect from the moment we walked in til the moment we left. Kind, friendly, helpful, discreet, not pretentious at all. The only slight misstep was that for our party of 9 we were recommended to order 18 dishes. This was an absolutely absurd amount of food for our party, and we ended up canceling as many dishes as we could nearing the end (around four or five) which they handled with grace and no complaints. We were floored by the food. The standouts for me were the duck tongue, the goat liver (I think) mousse with stone fruit jam, the goat empanadas, the ham frites, the diver sea scallops. Other favorites at the table were the beets, the bread, the sea bass, the beef tongue... Ok, pretty much everything!! We had a delicious sparkling rosé to start the night off and then drank a delightful Pinot Grigio the rest of the time, but I'll admit I barely had room. The atmosphere was also truly lovely.

Somewhere around the time of werewolf molecular gastronomists and obnoxious saffron addicts, I grew tired of Top Chef and stopped watching.

In The West Loop. And it's impossible to get in.<br><br>Of course.<br><br>Well, rave review after rave review finally piqued my interest to dismount from my high horse and... GatG shut me up. It shut me up good. I'm disappointed in myself for not watching Season 4 of Top Chef now. A local won. It was filmed in Chicago. The finale was in Puerto Rico. I have failed all around. <br><br>Every (and I mean 'every') dish I've tried has been enjoyable. The menu isn't haughty or alienating. It just offers fresh ingredients served in familiar (to a point) ways made with the utmost skill. This is doing it, doing it, doing it well. If you have great service (which you should), go with the suggested recommendation and order 2 plates per person. At a four top, that gives you 8 dishes (duh) and that should be just enough to fill your belly, delight your senses and make you join the church.

I hate green beans. Loathe them. I curled my body around the plate and made sure only I had access to these. Tremendous. Salty (fish sauce), savory genius. Kohlrabi salad with fennel, evalon, toasted almonds, blueberry, and ginger dressing? Made my guitar (and, by my 'guitar', I mean 'mouth') gently weep tears of joy. Chick.pea.fritters. Don't ask. Just act. Do. I had them with romesco, hazelnut hummus, sesame and goat feta. Breads. They sound basic. They taste fantastic. Don't count them as one of your dishes. Just order one or two for taste.<br><br>Fish: Grilled baby octopus with guanciale,  wax beans, radish, favas. pistachio-lemon vinaigrette. As guilty as I felt eating a baby anything (especially a baby sea monster), I can't deny that it was perfectly prepared and entirely addicting. Escargot ravioli. So much better than any escargot dish I've had in Chicago (and consumed before I would forever swear off escargot thanks to a traumatic experience in Uptown; more later).<br><br>Meat: goat. Duh. Terrine, empanada, straight up, etc. You're here to eat. Do so with abandon. You may think you know the animal, but Chef Izard knows how to change things up with each preparation to make you have entirely different experiences with the same protein... in the same setting. There's a reason (well, many) that she won the show, folks.<br><br>Desserts: they change. Get all four. No matter what they are, get.all.four. This is not up for discussion.<br><br>Cocktails: not a bad one to be had. The beer/wine list is impressive as well.

The plates your dining on are changed after every new dish so, the complex flavors are never mixed. Girl and the Goat is truly edible art and we were certainly impressed.<br><br>We ordered:<br><br>Grilled Baby Octopus with guanciale, wax beans, romano beans, radish, and pistachio-lemon vinaigrette - I really enjoyed the ingredients used in this dish.

However, the pistachio-lemon vinaigrette was just too overpowering making the entire dish too tart and salty.<br><br>Braised Beef Tongue with masa, beef vinaigrette and salsa verde - I thought the chef had such a creative play on the traditional way beef tongue is prepared. Thin slices of the tongue with fried masa, this was like a deconstructed (and fancy) taco. The masa was a wonderful contrast to the strong flavors of the vinaigrette and really balanced out the whole dish. <br><br>Diver scallops with bok choy and shitake mushrooms - My favorite plate and more mellow dish at Girl and the Goat. Don't underestimate it's subtle flavor though because these meaty and perfectly cooked scallops spoke for themselves. The delicious scallops were served on a bed of shitake mushrooms that were absolutely divine and a perfect complement. <br><br>Grilled Pork Ribs  with a tomatillo-mushroom slaw and grilled scallion vinaigrette -  These pork ribs were fantastic. They were fall of the bone tender and had a sweet glaze that won us over. <br><br>Confit Goat Belly with bourbon butter, lobster and fennel - The goat belly was so smooth and velvety it practically melted in your mouth.

I did.  I still don't get it.  Nothing special about it. <br>Follow the hype if you must.  I'm here to tell you that it's not as amazing as you hear.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "OMG foodgasm! The halibut, pork face, pork shank, and miso budino!! Must order those dishes. I am in love! I have always been a fan of chef Izzard ever since she competed in ToP chef. After a three month wait for a reservation, girl and the goat is my favorite restaurant! I can't wait to try little goat next time I am in Chicago.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Had a private dinner in the wine cellar as part of c2e2.  Total foodgasm. I'd watched top chef, never believing what the judges say until I dined with this winner. And she's delightful in person. I've been talking about this meal for years.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I'm not going to lie: we came here because my husband and I are huge Top Chef fans. And I was nervous after getting seated at a super-small, super-cramped table that they actually have to pull out to let one person sit down (I'm guessing this is a Chicago thing, because we've seen it more than once this trip). But our waitress was warm and friendly, my water glass was never empty, and nobody gave me grief when I only had one glass of wine.<br><br>The plates are offered in categories, so we just decided to pick one from each. We started off with the pretzel bread and smoked salmon cream, which was OMG good. There's nothing like fresh-baked bread, is there? And there was nothing fishy about the salmon cream - it was just rich and lovely.<br><br>Next up were the wood-grilled oysters, which were cooked perfectly. I've only just discovered that I loved oysters (after a trip to NOLA) - they were buttery soft and just super tasty. The chickpea fritters were different from expected, but not in a bad way - they just melted in your mouth. Our goat empanadas had a light, crisp exterior and were everything good in the world. <br><br>We got adventurous with our proteins, opting for the braised beef tongue (my husband's a fan of tongue; I'd never tried it before but am SO GLAD I did) and the fried frog's legs (he was terrified, but we're both converts). It was all so so so tasty.<br><br>Of course, we couldn't leave without dessert. We went with the rhubarb shortcake and plantain cake. There was something a little disconcerting about the latter, but again - not in a bad way. There was just a bit of bitterness to offset the sweet, and I decided after eating most of it that I liked it (took me a while - it was just a really complex dessert!). The rhubarb was awesome, too, all kinds of sweet and tart and crisp.<br><br>As a little bonus: right before dessert, I watched Rob Reiner walk into the restaurant. Totally thought I was hallucinating or making things up, but no, the waitress came by after seeing my shocked face and said, \"You saw him, right?\" Apparently he comes there regularly. No one sitting near us seemed to recognize him by face, but hello, this is Mr. \"When Harry Met Sally\" and \"Princess Bride.\" (I died a little. Seriously.)<br><br>The check was way less than I had anticipated, which was another nice bonus. My husband joked that G&tG did restaurant-ing the way Tyra Banks does modeling: H-to-T. Everything about the place was wonderful - the decor, the staff, the food. Even the bathrooms were perfect. Oh, and did I mention the music? When the Eels \"Fresh Feeling\" came on, I knew I was home (it was the song I walked down the aisle to at our wedding).<br><br>I vow to return to this restaurant every single time I'm in Chicago. Seriously, I loved it that much.", "pics": null}}]}
