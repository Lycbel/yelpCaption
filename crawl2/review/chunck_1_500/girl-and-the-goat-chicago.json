Tourists and locals alike continually flock here to indulge in her innovative menu with bold flavors, intricate platings, and wonderful combinations of flavors and textures. Dishes are tapas style designed to be shared by the table. Your server will tailor the progression of the dishes you order to build on flavors throughout the meal, ultimately reaching a crescendo with the final dish.<br><br>I love the hamachi crudo. It's got a chili-soy vinaigrette, finger hots, gooseberries, puffed black rice, and garnished with some microgreens. The hamachi is fresh, tender, and has a bit of a kick from the vinaigrette. The black rice adds a crunch to the dish.<br><br>The seared scallops are cooked perfectly. Each order only has 3 scallops, so plan accordingly based on your party size. There's also wild maitake and wood ear mushrooms, oyster sauce brodo, and a squash brandade. <br><br>The wood oven roasted pig face is perhaps the signature dish on the menu. There's a sunny side egg placed on top, with crispy potato sticks on the bottom. The pig face is crispy, fatty, and tender. It blends well with the potato sticks and egg.<br><br>The confit goat belly is absolutely unreal. It's got bourbon butter slathered over the entire dish, which is fantastic. There's also lump crab and lobster chunks. The goat is melt in your mouth tender, and the seafood is perfection.<br><br>The crisp braised pork shank is usually the finishing salvo of your menu, if you order it, and it's a must order. The pork is crispy on the outside and fall off the bone tender inside. It requires very minimal effort to extract meat off the bone, and the meat is so juicy, flavorful and tender.<br><br>Everything on the menu is executed flawlessly and there isn't such a thing as a bad dish. The above are just some personal favorites I get each time I visit. Even the roasted cauliflower is a must order. Other dishes that I recommend are the goat carpaccio, goat empanadas, and wood fired octopus. For dessert, get the semifreddo and toffee yummy cake.

We were lucky to get a reservation only a week in advance on Sunday at 5:30 PM. The place was already crowded when we got there. We sat in the corner where there's the huge picture of a girl and a goat in gothic style. It looks like a very cool place. We quickly ordered a few items from the menu which we have already chosen from looking at pictures and reviews on Yelp. We went for the goat liver mousse, scallops, goat ribs, wood fire octopus and duck tartare. <br><br>Everything was delicious! It's very unique and has interesting combinations incorporating Asian fusion and influence. These are dishes that you wouldn't typically see at other restaurants so I was very excited to try, and of course they didn't disappoint. The goat liver mousse was so smooth and the bread was warm and yummy. We had to ask for more bread since we finished it so quickly. They saw that we had 3 people so they asked if we want 3 scallops instead of 2. They just charged for the extra scallops. They were cooked perfectly. The goat ribs were very soft and felt off the bones. The octopus was pretty good but that didn't seem too creative compared to the other ones. I also had duck tartare for the first time and the duck didn't taste too strong or anything. <br><br>We were very happy with the food itself overall but quite disappointed at the service. The server seems inattentive and sometimes when we asked for something, he doesn't seem too enthusiastic to get it for us. I understand maybe because the place was crowded but still it makes our experience a bit less satisfying, hence the 4 stars. <br><br>We ended order one more dish, the roasted pig face since there was so much hype about it. When it was brought out, we were told to mix everything up, the uglier the better. So we did just that! It was creamy and very rich and heavy. I think it tasted good but a bit too much and not too balanced. They probably need more veggies stuff in there.

Interesting choice of presentation and Im sure during the day it'll look much better. I did though absolutely adore that cute little Goat motif in the center of the dining room wall.<br><br>Service : Considering it was a Friday night dinner, suffice to say the place was packed to the brim! We did have reservations though so got a neat little corner within 20 mins (I shudder at the thought of coming here as Walk Ins!!). Once seated though, the service was prompt and pleasant. <br><br>Food : We got ourselves a portion each of Goat Empanadas, Confit Goat Belly, Wood Fired Lamb Ribs and Wood Fired Oysters.<br><br>The Goat Empanadas were fried to perfection, the shell not too thick and the meat succulent although lacking a punch in flavor. <br><br>The Goat Belly was an interesting setup as I've never paired goat with seafood, let alone Lobster and Crab for that matter! The belly itself was cooked just right and as all Belly dishes go (Pork or Goat), it needs something to counter or balance that fattiness. Sadly with milder protein like crab and lobster, it just got lost and up being a one tangent dish. The bourbon butter though was exquisite!<br><br>The oysters were smoked to perfection. For a second, they almost looked raw :). The spice was well done and overall it was a decent dish<br><br>The lamb ribs were one of our favorite dishes of the night! Fall of the bone and the thick sauce coating is how you typically expect a well made ribs to be. <br><br>We ended our evening with a portion of their Aw Honey Honey dessert.

The short ribs were similar to when you get kalbi at a Korean restaurant, but the pairing of the apple salad was a good contrast. As for the lamb ribs, they were incredibly tender. It fell off the bone so easily that you had to lift the piece of meat onto your plate. The glaze on this was smooth and truly wrapped flavor all over the meat with no dry parts.

The style seemed to be a modern twist on comfort food, which is something we enjoy. We ordered a couple of vegetable dishes including the sauteed green beans ($13) and the roasted cauliflower ($13). For something so simple like greenbeans and cauliflower, our tastebuds were blown away from the get-go. The green beans had a great fish sauce vinaigrette and the cashews gave it an Asian-inspired flavor. The cauliflower with pickled peppers, pine nuts and mints all blended well together.

We loved the flavor of the goat in the empanadas as it wasn't too gamey or heavy. The miso bleu aioli, grilled pickled beech mushrooms, and queso fresco, brightened up the dish. The confit goat belly was probably my least favorite dish because it was so heavy with the bourbon butter, which coated all of the goat belly, lobster, crab, and fennel.<br><br>A couple pork dishes stood out with the wood oven roasted pig face ($19) as well as the must-order crisp braised pork shank ($26).

The food isn't going to blow your mind, the wait can be super long, and the value isn't quite there - but it is a fun place to visit. Especially if you're into Stephanie's work!<br><br>So the main dish that stands out is the wood roasted pig face. Now, don't let the name put you off - it's more of the tender meat of the cheek and the dish doesn't resemble a pig. For butchers and chefs, the cheek is actually a fought-over delicacy because it is very tender and flavorful (and also scarce in quantity). Get this dish every time - it will not disappoint you. <br><br>(Honestly, if you can't come back to Girl & and the Goat often, I'd consider getting one order per two people that want to eat this.)<br><br>The other stand-out dish was the pork roast - which is much bigger than the pig face but also not nearly as flavorful. It's still very good and crispy and can help fill the carnivores of the party, so I'd recommend getting this if you have at least one big eater in your party.<br><br>The rest of the dishes are all solid choices - though nothing mind-blowing at all. Because of the limited amazing dishes here, Girl and the Goat isn't our first must-go places in our foodie world but since you're probably already here, here's a quick rundown.<br><br>- Wood Roasted Pig Face: just in case you skimmed the review and missed it above. GET THIS<br>- Bread and Butters: there's usually 3 per season, with the mushroom butter usually being there. 4/5, cool imagination put into this, helps fill you, no need to get more than one.<br>- Happy Juice: it's nostalgic to me to get this. Off-menu, and they've changed the formula since. I think it's now some kind of ginger beer and other juice. Kinda small, but a tasty drink!<br>- Cauliflower: I keep ordering this despite all my previous reviews saying it's not worth it. We got it again because our waitress really enjoyed it, but we agreed it's not worth it.<br>- Goat Loin: The meat itself was very tough for some reason. But the olives and \"Mediterrean\" flavors around it were awesome. So 4/5 for the flavors, 3/5 for the meat.<br>- Scallops: perfectly cooked. Solid 4/5<br><br>Overall, I'm not sure if Girl and the Goat feels the need to innovate since they have so much demand through popularity. It's been 6 years since my last visit, and it felt even more commercialized than before. But if the formula works, then why fix what's not broken.

I was slated for a 10:30pm reservation on a Wednesday (odd time but I was flying in from the West Coast, so the time difference worked in my favor, plus you take what you can get at a place that is somehow still one of the hottest tickets in town years later). Slow baggage and some O'Hare Uber shenanigans meant any chance of checking into the hotel to change was a lost cause which left me rushing in a cab straight from the airport to the restaurant bags in tow. The host was incredibly understanding and kindly stowed our many bags away for the length of dinner and gave no mind to the fact that I looked like I had been traveling for the past 9 hours. <br><br>We were seated in high seats right by the kitchen, which I think is great for smaller parties as I love getting to interact with chefs and witness the frenetic energy that a busy kitchen emits. <br><br>Now on to the good stuff...<br><br>As far as drinks, I started with the \"Ring of Fire\" as slightly spicy tequila based drink balanced out with some pomegranate sweetness, followed with a nice hoppy IPA with good citra hops, juicy and hazy, and finished with the \"All Nighter\" the perfect rye based boozy after dinner cocktail to cut through some of the dessert sweetness. <br><br>The food at the Girl and the Goat is meant to be shared and my only regret is that there weren't at least two more of us to help take down some other items of the menu. <br><br>Here's a rundown of the food ordered:<br>Roasted Cauliflower with pickled peppers, pine nuts, and mint. <br>Spiced Shrimp with delicata squash, brown-butter miso aioli, and furikake<br>Seared Scallops with wild maitake and wood ears, oyster sauce brodo, and squash brandade<br>Wood-Fired Lamb Ribs with cranberry-tamarind glaze<br>Goat Empanadas with miso bleu aioli, grilled pickled beech mushrooms, and queso fresco<br>Confit Goat Belly with bourbon butter, lobster and crab, and fennel<br><br>Nearly every dish outmatched the one before it, with my personal favorites being the spiced shrimp (the pairing with the crispy squash really made this a complete dish) and the confit goat belly which was so decadent I can barely even begin to describe it. <br><br>For dessert we went for the caramel corn and malt balls which had vanilla malt ice cream, caramel popcorn and a chocolate magic shell. The piece de resistance was when one of the kindly chefs we had been interacting with throughout dinner tossed another dessert our way because \"you look like you've had a day,\" and that's how I discovered the joy of a sweet potato toffee cake and sour cream ice cream, two things I never would've imagined ordering on my own. <br><br>All in all, a fantastic experience and great to see that a restaurant with this much hype can exceed those expectations.

I loved the crunch of the onions over the warm, crisp empanadas. The goat meat was soft and tender. <br><br>We tried the bucatini and pork shank from the meats section of the menu. The bucatini noodles tasted freshly made and had a creamy sauce on it. We really liked this dish. The pork shank is MASSIVE. The meat falls right off the bone.

Wait times exceed 2-3 hours, as this restaurant is situated on Randolph Street in the insanely popular \"West Loop\" neighborhood in Chicago, which is quickly becoming one of the culinary capitals of the country.

From what I understand, the bar is first come, first serve, and you can order from the full menu here if you're willing to hawk seats.<br><br>Stephanie Izard has been getting a lot of press recently, and in my opinion, she deserves even more.

Seriously do not skip the cauliflower... even if you don't like vegetables. I could eat this all day. The salmon and beef tongue were pretty average in my opinion, though my friends RAVED about the salmon. The only dish I didn't care much for was the ribs, but these came second-to-last, and I was pretty full at this point. They are a bit fatty, so it really depends how you like your meat. My friend said this was his favorite dish. This was MORE than enough food for the 4 of us, and we all had arrived extremely hungry.<br><br>I know that the goat empanadas, scallops, squash blossom rangoon and crab cakes are also really popular. Gives good reason to return.<br><br>As if this place wasn't already spectacular, the service was stellar (we left well over 20%+ for tip), as they were really diligent all night. Our waiter also \"sequenced\" our food out, as we ordered all at once, which demonstrated the expertise / knowledgeability of the waitstaff here. There was 4 of us dining, and all said, even with the wine and dessert, this meal came out to under $70 / person, which is incredible for a meal of this caliber.<br><br>A+, would give 6 stars if I could, and you're almost certain to love, regardless of your demographic.

So you can only imagine how excited I was to come here... Unfortunately, I think this restaurant falls in the latter, largely due to Chef Izard's Top Chef acclaim. I found the dishes to be very heavy and the flavor contrast was too strong and callous .. It lacked the cohesion I typically seek in an award winning restaurant.<br><br>We came in on a Monday evening and waited a little over an hour for a table. I genuinely felt they would've seated us earlier if we stuck around (we went to a nearby bar to kill time), as we were seated minutes upon returning, despite the hostess informing us that there may be an additional 30 min wait. Anyhow.. we ordered the beet salad, escargot ravioli, beef tongue, pork face, and goat confit. <br><br>--The beet salad was delivered with arugula and ?radicchio, bathed in a vinaigrette. For me, I was unsure if the beets were fresh or canned.. it was slivered finely, and when you ate it with the green bitters, the contrast was so potent that it made it difficult to enjoy the subtle sweetness of the beets. For reference, my fav beet salad ever is Jean Georges' Public Kitchen and/or from ABC Kitchen .. This just missed the mark IMO.<br><br>-- Escargot ravioli was delicious by itself but it sat on a salty beef broth that was far too strong and overwhelmed the ravioli. I would recommend this dish if you knew how to construct your bite: would suggest plating the crunchy onion on top of the ravioli, and allow it to sit on the SMALLEST amount of broth in your spoon .. only then did it become more palatable for me.<br><br>-- Beef tongue: very much like a warm salad but no grain. Probably one of the more solid dish but the vinaigrette was too heavy to allow the savoriness of the tongue to stand out. There is a lot of texture in this dish but it was hard to construct a bite as the crisp (I think it might've been fried wonton/dumpling skin?) was oversized, so the different ingredient ratio was problematic.<br><br>-- Pork face is legit a rip of a Filipino sig sig. I wish they would give credit where it is due .. Deep notes of tamarind and vinegar, with great crispiness of the pig cheek/ears. Prob another one of my fav dishes largely because it reminds me of classic Filipino food in Queens, but very disappointed that it failed to credit a culture that mastered this dish for ages. And for $16-18 (don't remember exact cost), it was def overpriced compared to the aunties in Woodside that make it for $8-10 (and, trust me, they make it way better).<br><br>-- Goat confit was perhaps the most confusing thing I consumed all night. The goat didn't taste like confit cooking .. more like abbreviated braising. Meat was musky and muscular. It was accompanied by lobster which was deliciously sweet and drizzled with a cream reduction. The lobster by itself was great, but to add it as a complimentary note to the goat was very confusing and, personally, didn't mingle well. This dish was just unharmonious IMO. <br><br>Overall: it just wasn't my cup of tea. The different flavors within one dish contrasted too sharply for me to enjoy. It felt like the dishes were generated whimsically without much thought to its cohesion .. or maybe that's the intention? Moreover, I actually found the dishes to be heavy (ie overwhelmed with vinaigrette or the roux? coated the respective meat too much) that I felt absurdly gluttonous after eating here. And, for the record, portions are huge by NYC standard. If I had to do it again, I prob would've ordered no more than 4 dishes. <br><br>Would I recommend? I guess if you're into sharp contrasting flavors and rich cuisines, but, maybe for the more scrupulous tongue, it might be best to skip.

Â The dish itself is not pinned down to any specific region or style of cuisine in the world. There was a multi-cultural approach to the composition in my opinion. The breading was delicately soft, yet still sturdy enough the hold the filling. The inside was actually quite liquidy, which isn't a bad thing but took me off guard. The crab flavor is fresh and is not buried by the other ingredients. Â <br><br>Their Sourdough bread is actually worth ordering. Plenty of blueberry sweetness, along with that tang that sourdough has. The sauces and schmear gave it a further dimension that Â offers depth and comfort. Â  <br><br>The Goat Empanadas are solid, but I thought they would be amazing. The braised goat on the inside reminded me of peppered steak, with that distinct goat taste. The breading was a little starchier than I would like, as the flavor itself wasn't memorable. But they are still worth getting if you have a big appetite. I like that you can order them in any sized quantity. Â <br><br>Grilled Broccoli - Not as good as I hoped, but it primarily relies on the smoked bleu cheese sauce from underneath. Not as refined in composition as I would like, but there's something base satisfying from the sauce itself. The broccoli was OK, but since the sauce was the main attraction, they didn't do much to the broccoli. <br><br>Goat Belly Confit - This was not meant for any mere mortal, but for the gods! The fatty, gamy goat belly blended harmoniously with the lobster, while the bourbon butter intertwined an unholy marriage of flavor that destroys the stratosphere. If you ordered bread, sop up some of the bourbon butter once you're done with the meat. Honestly, this dish is worth Michelin star status. I absolutely recommend everyone order this, even if you are stuffed to the gills. Â <br><br>Lamb Ribs - With the wet rub they use, these bad boys are basically meat candy! Fall off the bone, plenty of candied char, with the lovely gamy taste to reign it all in. This is definitely still tapas size, but don't be afraid to order these. Â <br><br>Pork belly - Asian inspiration is strong with this one! The sour cherries and bok choy are a great combo to the slices of pork. Although I had envisioned a block of pork belly, they shave it down to thin slices and sear it to resemble pork chop pieces. This was the favorite dish at the table, so even the pickiest of people can appreciate this one. Â <br><br>Green Beans - Our server actually brought us out a decent size sample of the green beans, as he recommended we try them. I generally dont like green beans, but I figured I would give them a shot. They definitely tasted like fresh, boiled green beans, with a bunch of sauce drizzled on top. This was probably my least favorite part of the meal. There wasn't anything special about it IMO. I dont see how this could be the dish that created the restaurant. Im glad my server let me try it for free, but its not something I ever care to have again. <br><br>Chicken - Our waiter wrote this down by accident, so they gave it to us for free once they understood their error. I usually don't order chicken from places because its usually the most conservative dish on the menu. Surprisingly, they did a great job giving this tired old bird some new life. The chicken itself was moist, and they focused on just dark meat (makes sense from the gamy-centric focus). The Â plating was a work of art with all the colors and shaved vegetables they used. The honey ramp glaze was the real show stopper of this meal. The sweet yet earthy taste brought me back for more with each bite. Â <br><br>Popcorn Dessert - What a lovely dessert! Salty from the popcorn, creamy from the chocolate malt ball ice cream, and lightly sweet all around. It truly felt like having movie theater popcorn (light at the butter) with milk duds. They gave a good portion where two dainty people can share, or one hungry person. Â <br><br>Overall I was quite pleased.

Wasn't really a big fan of the chickpea fritter unfortunately- it was plated beautifully but the texture on the inside of the fritter was a little odd for my liking and the fritter itself was a little bland. <br><br>I like the ambience to this place, it's pretty hip and really good vibes, but is not good for kids as it may be a little loud and the menu isn't very kid friendly.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/C1imTJVOr5oW-rUJParYew/348s.jpg", "caption": "Olive Yu(zu) Focaccia"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PoP2fm38htkdj3-A-wdrXA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Chickpea Fritter"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wtgz_AeKdWoK6UFnwHYI-g/168s.jpg", "caption": "Goat Empanadas"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Absolutely delicious.

The server was friendly and recommended that two people usually get 4-6 dishes to share. We got 11 dishes (lol!). The kitchen decides what order they come out in from lightest to heaviest. <br><br>We ordered: <br>Sweet Onion Brioche bread - 10/10 This was by far my favorite. I felt stupid ordering bread at such a nice restaurant but omg, I would have felt stupid if I HADNT ordered this. I loved it so much i actually ordered another one in the middle of my meal. The bread is soft with a slightly sweet onion smell to it and it came with a pepper relish and the yummiest cream cheese (with a hint of smoked salmon) I've ever had. It was such a perfect combination of warm bread with creamy and cool cream cheese. THIS DISH IS TO-DIE-FOR. <br><br>Raw Oysters - 9/10 Fresh and tangy, loved it! Only downside is that it came with 4 :( <br><br>Green garlic pierogies - 8/10 Soft and creamy on the outside and crunchy and delicious on the outside. The corn and mushroom relish underneath was amaaaazing. <br><br>Escargot ravioli - 6/10 This is the first time I've had snail and it wasn't bad! The broth was a little salty though. <br><br>Goat empanadas - 9/10 I loved the mushroom and aioli that came with the empanadas. The meat was tender and juicy and very flavorful. <br><br>Goat belly confit - 4/10 I found that the crab meat didn't really belong but this dish is usually a huge hit with everyone. <br><br>Sauteed green beans - 7/10 Really enjoyed these green beans. They were blanched well so they still had a bit of crunch to them. The vinagrette on them is delicious and the peanuts were a nice surprise. However, there was SO MANY green beans that this was where I started to fill up. Beware, this is a huge dish (in comparison to the others). I sort of wish this came out more in the middle of the meal and not towards the end. <br><br>Crispy pork shank - 10/10 A huge crispy pork shank came out with a ranch and buffalo dressing and a piece of naan bread on the side. Wow!! Â The pork was so crispy on the outside and so juicy on the inside that I was able to just pull the bone clean off of the meat. I actually found that the meat itself was so flavorful that I did need or use any of the sauces it came with. All I needed was the naan bread. This is also a huge dish by itself too.<br><br>Caramel corn and malt balls - 10/10 What a fun dessert!! The scoops of vanilla had a crunchy chocolate coating and the light and airy but sweet popcorn was an interesting play on textures to contrast the cool and creamy vanilla. Sounds simple but it was a delight to eat. <br><br>Note: we really wanted to try the calamari bruschetta but it wasn't available that day. Apparently, not every dish on the menu is available every day. Every morning, each dish on the menu is made by the chefs to assess the quailty of the ingredients. If they are not up to par, that dish is not served that day. <br><br>Chef Stephanie Izard is a culinary genius. All of the food was unique, playful and interesting and I am excited to try her other restaurants.

I noted in the reservation that It was for a birthday dinner, and they gave us the best seats in the house at the chef's table. We were able to oversee all the dishes being made, which made our decision about what to order that much easier and fun! We started out with the goat empanadas, cause we felt It was our duty to order a goat dish at a goat restaurant, and they were highly recommended. They were absolutely delicious--fried to perfection and topped with some cheese, mushrooms, sprouts, and onions atop an orange sauce. The meet inside was super flavorful and It was a perfect portion for two. We also ordered the octopus, which was so good. It came over a pepita mole sauce and pickled banana squash. It was bursting with flavor, not fishy at all, and a great texture. We also ordered the wood grilled broccoli, which were charred to a wonderful crisp. The blue cheese sauce that accompanied It added a nice flavor as well as an addition of what seemed to be Rice Krispies for some texture. We got a complimentary kohlrabi salad that was super yummy. It was filled with so many different greens, adding so much flavor, such as fennel, beemster, roasted shitake, pear, etc. It was also dressed very nicely! Next, we had the wood fired lamb ribs, our favorite dish by far. They were so extremely tender and filled with so much flavor. They were absolutely delicious. Lastly, they gave us a complimentary birthday dessert of caramel corn and malt balls. The Caramel corn was crunchy and reminded me of an upscale Cracker Jack. The ice cream was so yummy and the chocolate shell was delicious. It was a perfect way to finish off all the goat restaurants!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Absolutely wonderful.

Â A real toss up between a three and a four star review.<br><br>First, I really wanted to go here, so I went onto OpenTable and looked up available times, and they stunk. Â Basically, during the 5 days I was going to be in Chi-town, they had 1030 pm on a Sunday night. Â That's cool, no big deal, but we happened to walk by two days earlier and I stopped in and asked if they had any earlier time. Â I was told no. Â But when I got back to the hotel that same day, I checked on OpenTable and they had 845 pm. Â This pissed me off. Â First of all, the restaurant should recognize that me booking through OpenTable costs them money, that's how the platform works, and if they'd just rebooked me themselves while I was standing there, it would have been free. Â I wish the guy would have said, \"If something earlier opens up, I can let you know.\" Â Anything is better than just \"no\", and going home and seeing the answer is yes.<br><br>Anyway, we arrived on time for our reservation but had to wait a bit around, like 15 minutes or so after our reservation time. Â We were sat in the main dining area, and it's very cramped and very noisy. I moved the table about two inches away from another table, and a server assistant came by and pushed it back and told me not to do that. Â So you can imagine when they then proceeded to sit a woman next to me that smelled like she bathed in perfume, I was not pleased. I hate the smell of perfume, especially when I'm eating. Â So since I knew I wasn't allowed to move over, we had to move. Â We got moved to the area closer to the bar, and we were happy because the table was shorter, so we were sitting closer to each other. Â We were in the hosts' butts, but we didn't mind.<br><br>Service was hit or miss, we waited a long time for repeat drink orders, and had to flag someone down. Â Food was good but nothing that stood out as being the best anything I've ever had - the pig face was quite good, and so was the goat liver mousse.

'It wasn't long.' Â He explained that everything is served family style and he recommended sharing 6 things since it was two of us. <br><br>The menu is pretty diverse and totally interesting.

Wow! That was impressive that they take service that seriously. We ordered the rest of our meal and he would determine how to bring our and order the courses. <br><br>We were ready for refills on our cocktails so I got a martini and my dinner partner ordered Best of Three.

I was already super full but we had two more things coming, so I had to muscle through. <br><br>Then came the goat empanadas. I have never had goat but felt compelled to try it since this place is known for it. The empanadas seemed like a good entry-level option. They were so good!

Other servers brought our dishes fairly quickly, were very attentive to refilling our water, and replaced our plates after each dish was brought out. <br><br>My dining experience here was extremely memorable and I know I will be coming back someday (hopefully soon).", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HIwt5e4kcAwDVdUBIr6V2A/348s.jpg", "caption": "Confit Goat Belly"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_RmiEpND6CR4M3j7pbgz7Q/168s.jpg", "caption": "Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PtVpRcRy7OG7HnrMHtrbwg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Seared Diver Scallops"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "BF: Where are we going for dinner tonight?<br>Me: You're going to be a goat! <br>Hashtag Girl & the Goat<br><br>People are not exaggerating when they say to make reservations months in advance, or get stuck with a 10pm slot (which I guess works well for people on Pacific time). Alternatively, I believe you can you can order off the regular menu if you snag a seat at the bar. <br><br>We arrived early and got drinks at the lounge area. Like the rest of the restaurant, the area was comfortably casual, service was prompt and friendly, and the cocktail menu was I-want-to-try-everything intriguing.<br><br>(++) I loved my LOCAL 75, which showcased Chicago's local specialties with Chicago Distilling Co. Ceres vodka and Chicago London dry gin infused with Asian-inspired flavors of black cardamom, yuzu, and lemongrass, with a finish of sparkling wine for good measure. The boo got the MORNING RITUAL with Creyente mezcal, Amaro Sfumato, Ancho Reyes, Chamargo de Chile, coffee bitters, vanilla, maple, lemon--as expected from the lengthy list of ingredients, it was thought-provoking and something you may Ernest Hemingway to drink before writing a novel. The $13 price tag is definitely justifiable considering the craftiness of the cocktails and the general classines of the whole Girl & the Goat schpeel. <br><br>(++) Our typical trick at fancy restaurants is to order the bread, because while it may seem overpriced, it is unlikely to disappoint and does a good job of filling you up amidst the rest of the dainty fine-dining-esque plates. The OLIVE FOCACCIA ($7) was indeed hearty and was on the artisan bread level with the asiago crusted exterior and pull-apart soft interior. The harissa butter was interesting but to me tasted too much like regular whipped butter, so I opted for the olive oil dip instead.<br><br>(+++) Though simple sounding, the SAUTEED GREEN BEANS ($12) lives up to its reputation. The beans themselves are fresh and sauteed to the perfect al dente texture, given a twist with the fish sauce vinaigrette, a crunch with the cashews, and a creaminess with the aioli. It's the homemade staple perfected to Chicago bucket list status.<br><br>(+++) The CONFIT GOAT BELLY ($16) was the most refined dish of the night, a delicate balance of melt-in-your-mouth goat belly (yes, it is similar to pork belly but more gamey), lobster and crab, and fennel, then glazed with bourbon butter. There is a lot going on and it takes awhile for it to all sink in. I suggest eating this dish in small bites in the true spirit of fine dining so that you can pick up on the complexities.<br><br>(+++) The CRISP BRAISED PORK SHANK ($26)... is huuuuggggee! I think the most amazing part is its texture, which was something of a gradient from a crispy roasty exterior to a buttery fall-off-the-bone interior. Although there was so much meat, it never got boring because of the heterogeneity of the meat and the DIY flavor options with the buttermilk dressing and curry sauce. The squash-shiitake kimchi kept things interesting as well with its provocative fermented tones, and the naan had a very thin texture with a puffy, doughy composition that reminded me of Taiwanese green onion pancakes. The touches of fusion seem a bit sporadic, but the creativity made it a memorable dining experience.<br><br>We were so stuffed (thanks to the bread and the giant pork shank) that unfortunately left had no room for dessert. Being the crazy Yelpy foodie that I am, I made sure we returned before leaving Chicago in order to try Girl & Â the Goat's famous goat cheese dessert.<br><br>(+) The YAY FOR GJETOST ($11) featured the gjetost (goat cheese ice cream), which had a delicious full-bodied flavor. You could taste the cheese, though it wasn't pungent per se and it was heavily incorporated into a lusciously creamy ice cream. In my opinion, the focus shifted somewhat too much to the accompanying apple cake, and it was too sweet for my tastes with the candied almonds and ample caramel sauce.<br><br>(++) I preferred the STICKY TASTY CRUNCHY YUMMY TOFFEE CAKE ($11) (it's not as much of a hodgepodge as it sounds). The sweet potato based cake was unique and earthy, pairing well with tart gooseberries. Again, I think it was made too sweet with the toffee sauce, toffee crunch, and brown butterscotch ice cream (though deliciously indulgent). <br><br>Overall, we really enjoyed our visits to Girl & the Goat. The price is very reasonable, considering the quantity of quality food. The style is casual-trendy with stellar high-caliber cooking and a backdrop of a chic rustic ambiance--perfect for trying Stephanie Izard's genius cooking without the stuffiness of fine dining.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rCNf_5kSWtOzntZNTuAsqg/348s.jpg", "caption": "Local 75 and Morning Ritual"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SySDBZYzSraBIzcDmon9tA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Olive focaccia ($7)"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Z0N2f2AJNnOhfIgICEeDag/168s.jpg", "caption": "Close-up of the delicious pork shank"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "A MUST in Chicago!!

I booked like a month before my visit and I ended up with a 4:45pm dinner on a Monday night, which seems crazy early for dinner but it was better than not having a reservation at all. <br><br>We ordered the following:<br>-Potato bread: A moderate sized bread round served with a red pepper sauce and a yogurt chive one. The yogurt chive one was my fave but if you mixed the two, you also get an amazing new sauce that the bread works really well with. The bread itself is pretty much a french with herbs and bits of potatoes in it. It was nice, soft and fluffy in the inside and crispy on the outside. We couldn't stop ourselves and ended up eating the whole loaf before our other dishes came. <br>5/5<br><br>-Branzino: Whole branzino fish bathed in a red fresno chile sauce, topped with a green papaya salad. The green papaya topping reminded me of the typical ginger slivers you find on a whole fish dish at your typical Chinese restaurant. The skin on the fish was nice and crispy. The sauce had a kick to it but it was not insanely spicy, worked really well with the fish. Loved that the fish was deboned but we did find some occasional bones towards the front of the head and the tail (our server had already warned us and we are no strangers to eating non-deboned whole fish)<br>5/5<br><br>-Crispy Pork Shank: This dish was amazing, the pork was so crispy on the outside, yet so tender on the inside. I was blown away when our server dropped off the dish and stabbed a fork into the middle of the shank, the fork literally melted into the meat as if it was butter on a warm loaf of bread... We snapped a couple of pictures and went straight to digging into it. The shank was served bone in. I lightly picked up the bone and the meat around the bone just fell off effortlessly. The dish is paired off with a kimchi sauce, a white light garlic sauce, a naan looking bread that tastes like a peking duck bun and some slivers of kimchied radish? This dish basically reminded me of a play on peking duck but with Korean fusion and with pork instead of duck. <br>5/5<br><br>-Bucatini: I wanted pasta so I got me some. The pasta itself was a little salty for my liking but all the flavors were there. The bucatini was cooked al dente and topped with tender pork shoulder and heirloom tomatoes. Super yummy, my husband killed most of it because he liked it so much. <br>5/5<br><br>-Toffee cake: Dessert cake made with sweet potatoes, topped with toffee, served with a butterscotch ice cream and some tart fruits. This dish was our least favorite. The savory dishes here definitely overshadows the sweet dishes here. We could've gone with it but we came so far and we had to at least try their desserts. <br>3/5<br><br>We had 5 dishes and our bill came out to be under $100!

I will say I am typically never a fan of expensive small plates but Girl and the Goat was an exception. We were a group of 7 (definitely get reservations ahead of time) and ordered 17 dishes (waitress recommended 2-3 dishes per person but we like to eat). I'm not a big goat/lamb/meat in general fan so I'll give my take on my favorites but pretty much everything we ate was raves about. <br><br>From the breads section, get the sweet onion brioche. That relish is bomb and the salmon cream cheese was a subtle touch. I hate olives so the olive bread was not for me but if you like a strong olive flavor, check it out. <br><br>From the vegetarian section, I recommend the green beans, cauliflower, and pierogis. I absolutely hate it when restaurants make vegetables bland but this was not the case here. Everything was packed with flavor and had multiple components that somehow all worked beautifully together. Roasted cauliflower was the best from this section. Beet salad could be skipped. <br><br>I love seafood so I liked everything we tried from the fish section - calamari (be warned it's not fried), crab Rangoon, and halibut. The halibut has a nice sear to it and worked well with the mushrooms. The creamy squash in the rangoon was a creative and delicious twist. The bruschetta underneath the calamari was bomb. <br><br>From the meat section, the winner from everyone else at the table was the lamb ribs. The pork shank was tender and the naan was great if it came fresh from the oven. The pig face was like a breakfast dish and was ok, and the grilled chicken had a nice rub to it.<br><br>From the goats section, the goat empanadas were deemed alright. Apparently the meat was ok but the empanada shell was tasty. The goat belly was pretty meh and also took a while to come out of the kitchen so we were all pretty stuffed by the end. <br><br>What sets Girl and the Goat apart from the other expensive tapas style restaurants I typically hate is the service. Maybe it's because we were such a large and expensive party, but we got the olive bread on the house. When the goat belly took too long to get to our table, the waitress gave it to us free of charge. Then we had some issues with how hot the restaurant was (heat wave in Chicago today) and had asked the waitress if there was a way to cool it down (there wasn't but she brought lots of ice to us), she politely explained the situation and then gave us two free desserts on the house to make up for the heat.

Â <br><br>When you walk in, you are greeted nicely by the hosts and it has a large, but cozy feel to it. Â It was decorated for the holidays and I loved how tasteful they ornaments were. Â It wasn't gaudy or corny, but really beautifully decorated. Â The restaurant had a rustic feel to it but it wasn't trying too hard.<br><br>Our server was great - she was very easygoing, helpful, and not snobby at all. Â The people taking the plates and refilling the water were very polite as well. Â Sometimes when you go to more well-known restaurants in the West Loop, you can get pretentious vibes from the servers, but I did not feel that here at all.<br><br>Being a pescatarian, this place is pretty meat-heavy and a haven for goat-meat lovers. Â Being a foodie though, this place had been on my bucket list for quite awhile. Â They were accommodating with making some dishes vegetarian/pescatarian-friendly, which I really appreciate. We ordered a bunch of smaller plates for sharing.<br><br>We started out with the olive focaccia bread served with a yuzu-harissa butter and lime olive oil. Â The olive pieces soaked up the lime olive oil flavors and the yuzu-harissa butter was unique and delightful. Â I absolutely loved every second of this dish being an olive lover. Â I don't see harissa on many \"New American\" menus so I appreciated the uniqueness of it. Â <br><br>The second plate consisted of raw oysters served with a lemon mignonette. Â The oysters were so fresh and some of the best tasting oysters I have ever had in Chicago. Â The mignonette was a wonderful complement to the more intense oyster flavors. Â The oysters were just the beginning of our adventures with seafood that night.<br><br>The grilled cuttlefish was also a unique assortment of flavors. Â It was good but I wasn't taken by anything really. Â I did really like the hot mustard and pistachio lemon relish. Â The fingerling potatoes were a nice texture addition to the different texture of the cuttlefish pieces. Â The cuttlefish had a really nice texture and was grilled, but had more of a subtle flavor.<br><br>My favorite dish of the night were the potato blue cheese pierogies. Â If you knew me, you'd be surprised that this was my favorite dish because compared to the other dishes, the flavors weren't super unique, but it just all blended really well together and tasted delicious. Â The blue cheese was a zesty, exciting flavor paired with the more mild potato flavor. Â I really loved the maitake mushrooms served on top of the apple relish. Â I am not super into apples but I really enjoyed the relish because it wasn't dominated by the apples.<br><br>We ordered the sautÃ©ed green beans as a side because the server had raved about them. Â But I was kind of underwhelmed by them. Â They were not super flavorful and were a bit bland for my tastes. Â They weren't extremely bland but just not that great. Â I did like the cashews but the fish sauce could have been stronger.<br><br>We ended our meal with the Calamari Bruschetta, which was also another highlight. Â The calamari was sautÃ©ed perfectly and was served on top of the goat milk ricotta and apples. Â It was not your typical bruschetta and I appreciated how creative of an approach this was. Â I am not crazy about apples but the goat milk ricotta was heavenly. Â <br>Unfortunately, we were too full for dessert because we had too many small plates.<br><br>I did really enjoy this experience but probably hyped it up too much in my head. Â I think there are other restaurants in this echelon that have more options for me and have more exciting flavors.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PlQjxXWSUGLk8OLBipo4bA/348s.jpg", "caption": "Olive Yuzu Focaccia"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/p-dWSoCk-AUexxVPFmJWvA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Raw oysters"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fL0Z9-f6OiIcFU85BOgz7w/168s.jpg", "caption": "Grilled Cuttlefish"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Heard a lot about this restaurant, wanted to see the hype and here for a birthday celebration.<br><br>Service: 3.5/5 stars, <br>reservations @10p.

We sat front and center at the bar so service was really fast, we were done in an hour! <br><br>The menu consists of shared plates and you order everything in the beginning and then they will bring them out to you one by one, which I thought was a great system so you could focus on each dish by itself. We started with the hamachi crudo, light and refreshing and perfect for the hot sunny afternoon. Next was the goat empanadas, because why would you come here and not order goat?! I could tell the difference in taste from your typical beef or chicken, but it wasn't bad in any way, just unique. The blueberry salsa was probably my favorite part. Then we had the escargot ravioli. I would've never ordered this on my own but I'm glad that my boyfriend did! It's served in this bacon tamarind broth but it really reminded me of minestrone from its smell and color. I think the crispy onions were the perfect touch. Last but certainly the best item of the night, wood oven roasted pig face!

In fact, it lends itself well to the casual tapas-style dining.<br><br>We waited 15-20 minutes for our reserved table, which wasn't too bad for a bustling Saturday night at peak dinner hour. Our server was prompt and fairy attentive. She recommended 4-5 plates, so that's what we did.<br><br>We had the olive focaccia bread as a starter. I'm not a big bread person, but I thought it was pretty good (albeit a little on the dry side). It had a strong olive flavor. For the other plates, we did the hamachi crudo, pan-fried shishito peppers, braised beef tongue, and goat empanadas. Everything was very good. I liked the empanadas the best, with the shishito peppers a close second. For the price, the hamachi seemed a little on the skimpy side, but it was delicious... I don't think I'd order it again, though.<br><br>I felt myself getting full halfway through the goat empanadas (our last plate), so the server was spot-on with her ordering quantity suggestion. <br><br>All in all, I would say that Girl & the Goat came pretty close to living up to the hype. I really enjoyed the experience, and there's no denying that Stephanie Izard is a talented chef. Each dish was carefully thought out and executed well.

We underestimated their small plates and portions. We could have passed on the bread and perhaps something else. I also did not care for the empanadas. The halibut was delicious, but I like seafood dishes in general so this might be biased. My FAVS were definitely the green beans, scallops and pig face. Would highly recommend those. If my stomach had more room, I think I would have enjoyed the pork shank more.<br><br>After dining here, I can see what all the hype is about. Great service and food.

I was a big fan of the chipotle butter. The yogurt spread, while tasty wasn't anything completely amazing. <br><br>Goat Carpaccio: This was an interesting take on goat. The roe on it was also interesting. You could taste some of the gaminess of the goat. One of the more interesting and unique dishes. <br><br>The Squid Bruschetta: I think our mistake may have been ordering this along with the bread. This is heavier than the term bruschetta may lead you to believe. The squid had a dark sweet flavor. While the squid was well cooked and made a good compliment on top of the bread, this dish was almost too heavy. <br><br>Pig Face: Again I'm not sure if expectation was the enemy here. The pieces of pork were crispy with a sunny side up egg on top. It was reminiscent of a hash. Again it's a heavier dish. <br><br>I think there were notes of brightness I was missing in the heavier dishes. Overall the dishes were good, but I was more expecting mind blowing flavors. In addition to the food the service was mixed for us. The bar tender was attentive and clearly passionate about his beer. The server however made us feel rushed.

There were some tiny missteps with food, but the service, atmosphere and overall quality did not go unnoticed. <br><br>First and foremost, this was some of the best, non-fussy service I've ever experienced. We had a very knowledgeable, friendly server; she kept our water and wine glasses filled. (We ordered a bottle of white, which was kept on ice throughout the meal--nice touch!) <br><br>The cadence of the meal was perfection! Usually with small plates, you get a hodgepodge of whatever comes out of the kitchen first. This felt like we got a staged, 5-course meal of small plates, one right after another, with courses cleared in between. Small details, but they certainly enhance the experience of the meal. <br><br>The food! Our first \"course\" was the sweet onion bread, which came with a salmon cream cheese and pickle relish. The bread was excellent--you could taste the onion in the bread. The salmon cream cheese was really really subtle; my friend is a huge smoked salmon fan, and she couldn't really taste it. I personally loved the subtlety; it was like putting lobster butter on bread. The pickle relish was great, too! It added a nice tang and spice to the dish. <br><br>The goat empanadas are really yummy! The empanada itself is good, but not exceptional...but I did like what came with it; the addition of pineapple and blueberry was surprising, but it worked SOOO well! Very tasty! <br><br>Then came the pan-fried shishito peppers. A good dish! I wouldn't have ever thought to combine parmesan cheese and miso, but it worked! There was a bit too much of the cheese for our liking, but the peppers were nicely cooked and it was unique combination of flavors! <br><br>Then we had the escargot ravioli, which was one of our least favorite dishes. The broth was rich, but the bacon made it too salty; it tasted like it had been over-reduced. It also had an unpleasant sour flavor. Pasta of the ravioli was nicely-cooked! <br><br>The highlight was the pig face--it was like breakfast for dinner on a plate. The egg was a tad overcooked, but the crispy pig face was really good, and the subtle taste of maple was really yummy. And the potato stix gave it a nice salty crunch. Highly highly recommend!<br><br>We also got dessert. We tried the caramel corn and malt balls, and as a thank you from the kitchen, they gave us a small tasting portion of the lemon pound cake. (Very nice touch!) <br><br>The caramel corn and malt ball dish is suuuuuuuper sweet and very rich. I only had a couple bites. The caramel corn is very good, but the malt cream was a bit too rich. It also came with some sort of salty, chewy, taffy-like candies(?) which made it a few ingredients too many. Decent dessert, but a bit decadent. <br><br>I devoured the lemon pound cake! It was super light and tasty; the ice cream it came with was perfection! We thought it was avocado, but apparently it's a sorrel ice cream! It gave it a really nice fresh kick to the dish--highly highly recommend! <br><br>Overall, top notch service, great food, and for the amount of food we got plus a bottle of wine, for the quality, the price tag was not as bad as we expected! <br><br>Still a special occasion place, but worth the visit and the hype!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "My husband and I arrived early before they opened hoping to get a seat at the bar because we didn't have reservations.

Stephanie Izard, top chef winner and Chicago native, has outdone herself with an innovative menu of family style small plates/tapas with bold flavors and Mediterranean influence. Whether you are an adventurous eater, ready to indulge in duck toungues, roasted pig face, and goat empanadas or you love more traditional fare such as succulent ramp marinated chicken, tender baby short ribs, and sautÃ©ed green beans, Girl and the Goat has something delicious for everyone. A dining experience at Girl and the Goat, located in the trendy west loop, is highly coveted, so make sure to make a reservation well in advance. We made our reservation a few months in advance on OpenTable. Initially there were only reservations available at 10:45 pm on Thursday, however we checked back and reservations opened up. We ended up making a reservation at 7:30 pm on Thursday. They were very busy but we were seated quickly. There are plenty of tables throughout the restaurant and also communal style seating on a long booth in the center of the restaurant, which is where we were seated. <br>The server explained the menu, that a group of two diners typically orders four to six dishes to be shared and that the dishes would be served starting with the lightest and ending with heaviest. Some dishes can also be served as half orders which was advantageous for myself since my dining companion has an aversion to seafood while I love it and wanted to try a little bit of everything. Most dishes range from $12-$28 a piece. <br><br>The goat empanadas, piqued our interest and we were so glad we ordered these as they were one of our favorite items that we tried here. The goat empanadas were served as two, with miso-blue alioli, chanterelle mushrooms and apple giardiniera. The sauce was so flavorful and the goat meat was tender and delicious. If you have never consumed goat meat before, it's almost reminiscent of pulled pork, very tender, flavorful, and delicious. <br><br>Next up were the chickpea fritters, served with quinoa tabbouleh, chickpeas, pomegranate seeds, feta, and a tahini vinaigrette. The combination of flavors was amazing. The fritter had a polenta or tofu like texture. The sauce was delicious. Next we had the green garli pierogies, served with a scallion sour cream, and tomato rhubarb relish, very tasty. <br><br>Service has the illusion of being attentive as there were certain employees throughout the restaurant who's only responsibility was keeping everyone's water glass filled and plate-ware and utensils fresh and clean. However, our main waiter never came back and checked on us throughout the entire meal after the first initial order taking, even though he checked on the family next to us several times. I had to wave him down to add a couple seafood dishes to the order and a cocktail. <br><br>I ordered the fried oysters. They were delicious! If you've never had fried oysters, I'd equate them to the flavor and texture of a fried mushroom. I also had a half order of scallops, which was one scallop, since my friend doesn't like seafood. The scallop was garnished with brown butter alioli, blood orange, smoked beet, and pistachios. The flavors and garnishing was great but I actually thought the scallop was slightly undercooked. <br><br>Next up were the crispy beef short ribs, my other favorite menu item, served with avocado and grapefruit. The meat was melt in your mouth tender...so delicious. Finally we were served the ramp marinated grilled chicken, a very generous portion, large enough to be a meal of its own, served with shaved carrots, red peppers, and spicy peanut crunch. Bone-in chicken was fall off the bone tender and the combination of flavors was unique and delicious. I also really enjoyed the cocktail that I ordered, It's Always Sunny in Oaxaca, mezcal, mango, turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, and cayenne...subtly spicy and very tasty. I would definitely order this again. A couple next to us ordered the pork shank, a very large generous portion, served with pita bread and various dipping sauces which looked and smelled amazing. I will definitely be ordering the pork shank upon my next visit. <br>The family next to us, was offered a complimentary dessert by our same waiter, even though they said they were too full. However, we were not offered a complimentary dessert. It seemed like when I had inquired about half orders, in regards to seafood, that our waiter toned down the service which doesn't seem right since we spent $136 on our total bill between the two of us.

Â I called a little over a month in advance as my wife and I were traveling to Chicago for our tenth anniversary, which I did let the staff know when I booked the reservation.<br><br>The place was packed at 7:45 on a THURSDAY. Â We started with a couple of drinks at the bar. Â My wife had a very well-made traditional old fashioned, and I had a slightly more modern gin concoction that was garnished with cinnamon. Â Both were very tasty.<br><br>The restaurant is pretty well laid out - there's a pretty spacious lounge for waiting, a sizable and well stocked bar, and you can see into the kitchen from practically every table. Â However, if you are very fortunate, the host will lead you to two bar chairs that directly overlook the grill station in the kitchen - the chef's table.<br><br>From there, we had a full view of the kitchen and all the food going out, which informed on which dishes we ordered. Â Everything from the grill and oven is wood-fired; and the chefs in the brigade are on point even during the busiest rush. Â They do suggest 2-3 dishes per person, which are served family style. Â We settled on duck tongue, the shishito peppers, a grilled broccoli dish, scallops, lamb ribs, and goat belly, and a reasonably priced 2011 Bordeaux. Â (The head-on branzino and octopus also looked amazing, but we did not try those dishes). Â <br><br>Everything that came out was 5 stars. Â The duck tongue was nice and crispy. Â The Shishito peppers combined with a Parmesan cheese crust gave a nice degree of heat that didn't overpower the flavor of the peppers and cheese. Â The grilled broccoli was served over a wonderful tahini yogurt sauce, the scallops were served with this rich oyster sauce that I could've eaten a whole bowl of by itself. Â The lamb ribs were falling from the bone, and the goat belly was remarkably tender and earthy.<br><br>We finished off the meal with two terrific desserts- a chocolate pavlova with chocolate ice cream and caramel inside the crust, and grape gelato combined with peanut butter cake and cookie crumbs that called to mind the flavors of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.<br><br>If you love great food, you must eat at this restaurant at least once.

Hearty, rich and filled with flavor. Last entree was the wood oven roasted pig face. Set aside the image that conjures and order it. It's designed to evoke a breakfast hash and it's the best you've had. Just a perfect combination of flavor and texture, and the egg ties it all together. For dessert, the aw honey honey was ethereal, airy and crunchy and not-too-sweet. We also tried the sticky tasty yummy toffee thing ... So good. Richer than the honey honey, but not too sweet or overwhelming. You'll see in the pictures that we usually dug in before I remembered to take a picture. The visual appeal Lisa consistently strong.

Again, if you're going on a date, REZZIES, YO.<br><br>We ordered sauteed green beans, seared diver scallops, pan-roasted bass, crispy beef short ribs, duck tongues, and the sourdough. <br><br>Obviously, the bread came first. It's kind of hard to mess up bread. The feta was a nice touch, I preferred it to butter. It's just so foreign to me that we pay for bread? I don't know. <br><br>Next, came the duck tongues. Can I just the idea of duck tongues is morbidly hilarious? All these ducks with no tongues. Anyway, they tasted like French fries that had been cooked in duck oil. To be honest, that might have been a better way to make this dish, rather than what was served. It captured my interest at first, but was no longer fun after the first couple tongues. I was more interested in the tuna chunks. I would hardly call it \"poke\" though. That's rude.<br><br>We got the crispy beef short ribs next. Honestly, the star of the whole dinner. I highly recommend this. I really enjoy how they made the meat crispy without overtly frying it. What magic. The relish of avocado and the ruby red grapefruit chermoula really completed the taste of it. This was the peak of the dinner.<br><br>After that, we received the scallops. They were okay. I couldn't really taste the aioli or blood orange. Just you're usual ole scallops. <br><br>The pan-roasted bass was decent. I'm Chinese-Filipino, so I really appreciated the pork belly adobo. The sticky rice-coconut jus did not have enough coconut to it. Starfruit was interesting but tasty. The bass, however, left much to be desired. Unmemorable. Like, as I write this review, I literally cannot remember what it tasted like. <br><br>The dishes are tiny as heck, especially for the price. Maybe the experience was dampened not only by the wait, but earlier in the day, we had the best dim sum I've ever had in my life, and for six of us, it came out to $21 each. It was more than enough food. Here, for three, it came out to around $39 each for three people, and we were just barely full. The portions are TINY. Three scallops?<br><br>The restaurant boasts \"global influence,\" and it's really sad because a lot of these dishes should not cost as much as they do. Butter chicken? Adobo? Come on now. My mom makes better adobo than this and for a lot cheaper. I wouldn't come here again unless someone else paid for me. It's a shame because there are so many good looking dishes on the menu, but it's another case of expectations vs. reality. Maybe we were just unlucky or something because I'm desperately trying to like it as all the previous reviewers did.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "One of the best restaurants I've ever been too.

Once we booked our trip to Chicago, I knew I had to get a reservation at this restaurant so we got booked our reservation several months in advance. Below are a few dishes we enjoyed:<br><br>Calamari Bruschetta - When I was reading reviews of this restaurant, I instantly knew we had to try this dish. I was so glad I did because it was amazing! The flavors melt in your mouth and the bread was perfectly toasted. Definitely order this dish! <br><br>Pan Roasted Halibut - The fish was perfectly pan roasted and the flavors of the vegetables worked really well with the dish. <br><br>Wood Grilled Broccoli - This vegetable dish was recommended by the staff and I can see why. It sounds simple - just broccoli, right? But, when you mix the broccoli with some cheese and crispies, it's a game changer! This is the perfect dish to complement the heavier flavors of the other dishes.<br><br>Woodfire Glazed Lamb Ribs - Another amazing dish! The ribs were perfectly marinated and cooked to perfection. It wasn't too gamey in flavor. Highly recommend this if you like lamb! <br><br>Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face - Several reviews mention this dish as their favorite dish. If you've ever had a fried egg with pork belly, the flavors are pretty similar to this dish. Overall, this dish was good but not amazing in my opinion. It may also be because it was our last dish of the night and we were pretty impressed with their other dishes. Â <br><br>Goat Empanadas - When they have an entire menu on the side dedicated to goat dishes, we knew we had to at least order one to try it out. The empanada was perfectly crispy on the outside and the filling inside was amazing. It's a bit pricey considering it only comes with 2 but the it was pretty good. The pineapple-blueberry salsa was really refreshing and was a nice spin to the dish. <br><br>I would recommend making reservations beforehand because this restaurant was completely packed on a weekday night. Prices are pretty reasonable for the quality of their dishes.

You had to go to the website, click, hover, wait and wait for a good reservation to open up on Open Table. The first reservation that I got was 10:00pm, then 9:00pm, the best one that I kept was 8pm. <br><br>We arrived half an hour early and thanks to the table that left before us, our table was ready in 5 minutes.

Two dining rooms separated with a divide and both sides were bustling with diners, staff and chefs. <br><br>The three of us went with much anticipation and excitement. The menu is farm-friendly and vegetarian friendly. The food was rich, unctuous and very novel.<br><br>We ordered: <br>1) The escargot ravioli, which had a surprisingly palate cleansing seafood taste compared the savory rich bacon-y pig-bone broth that the escargot was bathing in. I was so enamored with the sauce that I tried to drink it. DON'T. Its very salty.<br><br>2) Duck tongues- I loved this! The duck tongues were fried bits of protein with a spicy piri piri sauce and mixed with tuna and black bean. It was very appetizing, spicy and refreshing and so unique! Something that I've never had before.<br><br>3) Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face. I thought this would arrive on the pig's head. Surprise! Instead, the pig's face is boiled down, flattened like a hamburger and has a sunny side egg on top. This tasted like simmered savory bacon and that runny egg mixed so well with the pig face. <br><br>4) Beef tongue. This was a like a deconstructed beef tongue tortilla/taco. Beef tongue with crispy tortillas, beef vinaigrette and salsa verde. This was an excellent way to eat savory tender beefy tongue. We put the tongue slices on the tortilla with salad and salsa verde. I wanted a whole bowl of this for myself.<br><br>5) Crisp braised pork shank. This was the best version of pork shank that I've ever had. The pork shank was tender, fall off the bone and the outer parts crisped in jus and butter. The fresh piece of buttery soft naan was perfect to roll up bits of the pork and stone fruit kimchee.

The pork is deep fried very quickly, so the outside is crispy. I like this unique manner in which this pork is prepared, however, I feel like it falls short just a bit. Reason being if you happen to take a piece of the pork tha tis all on the outside, you're just gonna get the skin and it tastes very very dry and grindy. You really have to cut the pork in a manner in which you get the inner soft parts, but also outer crispy parts. I would like to see the chefs cut it for you, but in a deeper 'score' like manner such that the presentation of the entire shank is still maintained, but it's cut in a way you'll fully enjoy the taste. Either way, the flavors of this dish is really solid<br><br>Goat belly (5/5) - By far my favorite dish of the night. It's a very small portion, but executed with so much thought and finesse. This goat belly is served with lobster, crab, and fennel. It's almost like a surf and turf, with a lot more thought behind it (Rather than just throwing meat and seafood on a dish). The goat belly was rich, but the addition of the crab and lobster provides a refreshing lightness that tones down and complements the richness of the goatbelly. The fennel added a really nice texture and rounded out the profile of the dish overall.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fBh_EalqX3uWx6yXpAkogA/348s.jpg", "caption": "string beans. highly recommend!"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8xh6OaSyO6NV_HAcD2htpg/168s.jpg", "caption": "lamb shank. flash deep fried. not bad."}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CabzLb0BNIICG4sv0IRnyA/168s.jpg", "caption": "goat belly. highly recommend, but don't expect a good portion. just for taste"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "I'll start things off with a quick warning, reservations fill up 2-3 weeks before the day.

Not sure how far in advance this call needs to be made (we called about 24 hours ahead of time) but the way that the bone cleanly fell out tells me that it must have been cooked or soaked for hours.

The signs are super confusing anyway with arrows pointing in both directions, guaranteeing some sort of major mess-up for you and a nice ticket from the government. I suggest you take public transportation, Uber, or take advantage of the curbside valet parking.<br><br>AMBIANCE/SERVICE:<br>----------------------<br>The decor is simple and cozy. The girl and goat painting near the front is super cool, deviant art-like. All the staff are wearing shirts that display goats doing cute/funny things. Clever!<br><br>Service is absolutely on point. I had to bring this up before the food section, because flawless service is key to the dining experience here and we were not disappointed. There are so many items it can be intimidating to navigate the menu, especially since two of us have food allergies, but our server easily guided us along with recommendations and items that could not be eaten. He even organized our dishes to be sent out in optimal succession. Also as each dish was placed before us, it was announced as safe/not safe for my friend who has an allergy to certain forms of fish. Super critical and effortlessly delivered. Thank you!<br><br>FOOD/DRINK:<br>--------------<br>And the best way to kick off said dinner? How about *The Very Old Fashioned* featuring J. Henry \"Blind Goat\" bourbon (crafted specifically for this restaurant)? Yes, we'll take a round. Very smooth and complemented the dishes very nicely.<br><br>Now let's get to the food.<br><br>*Duck Tartare* with gooseberries, pickled mushrooms, gochujang mayo, cracklins, duck dad lavish - Great start to the meal. Not overwhelming in flavor, good texture.<br><br>* Hamachi Crudo* with crisp Pork belly, chili aioli, caperberries - Sliced perfectly thin and I enjoyed the contrast in texture of the other elements in the dish. <br><br>*Duck Tongues* with tuna and black bean poke and piri piri chili powder - Crispy and flavorful, but not my favorite dish. The tongues were a bit chewier than I would have liked.<br><br>*Roasted Beets* with green beans, white anchovy (on the side for us), avocado creme fraiche, bread crumbs - LOVE! I'm a huge fan of beets, and these were prepared perfectly.<br><br>*Goat Liver Mousse* with pickled rhubarb, giardiniera, bread & butter, pickles - Super buttery, creamy, and everything you're missing in your life if you like liver. That mousse is bomb! And don't forget the super buttery popovers too. Nommm.<br><br>*Wood Grilled Broccoli* with rogue smokey bleu, spiced crispies - Why are all the veggies here so darn good? Another great dish that goes well with everything. Spiced crispies on point.<br><br>*Calamari Bruschetta* with clam baguette, goat milk ricotta, goat bacon, green tomatoes - This dish is heavier in flavor than the others, or maybe this is because I'm starting to feel STUFFED around this point in the meal.<br><br>*Pan Roasted Halibut* with marcona almond butter, white asparagus, blueberry nuoc clam - Bursting with flavor! Although I'm super full already by now, I'm still going because this dish is so tasty. If you like Halibut, get this.<br><br>*Roasted Cauliflower* with pickled peppers, pine nuts, mint - I said it before and I'll say it again. They nailed all the veggies! <br><br>*Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face* with sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine-maple, potato stix - Pig Face is life. Even though I feel like I have no room left in my tummy, somehow I'm able to keep eating this. Super delicious and savory in all the right ways!<br><br>*Crisp Braised Pork Shank* with buttermilk dressing, grilled spring onion and radish kimchi, naan - Extremely crispy skin and quite the chunk of meat. We could barely finish this dish, it pretty much owned us. I think I prefer the Pig Face to this dish, but many of the others liked this one more.<br><br>SUMMARY: 11 dishes, 6 people, $57 each including tax and tip.

Delicious fish dish. <br><br>But honestly you have to get the pig face. It sounds scary but it's so approachable. It's like breakfast.

Pretty decent but not something you need to order.<br><br>Shishito Peppers: Tons of shishito peppers even for a half order with some bread crumbs and sauce. The shishito peppers were tender and a great side dish for any dish. The sauce had some depth to it that matched the bread crumbs heaviness, which I felt made the dish so great.<br><br>Roasted Beets: Beets are so appealing to me now and I loved the avocado sauce in it. The beets and the green beans just worked with the avocado sauce.<br><br>Lamb Ribs: Didn't feel lamb-y at all. It tasted like any fall-off-the-bone ribs with a sweet sauce with some sliced green onions. The 4 ribs were a bit fatty but nothing I didn't expect.

I mean, it's the most reviewed restaurant in Chicago. When a place is THAT popular, I tend to like it less. It's like with the super popular kids in high school. When they already have so many fans, how does my fandom make a difference? I'm merely just another number on the growing list. <br><br>I'm from LA. I had heard about girl and the goat before moving to Chicago. It was at the top of my list of restaurants to try like everyone else. My very first time dining here was in 2013. My fiancÃ©'s cousin made a reservation for us. That dinner was exquisite. We loved it. Since then, the number of times I've been here is in the double digits. When you have a homogenous group of friends back in LA, everybody who visits Chicago wants to try the place. At one point, I was scared to come back and would tell my friends I'd meet up for drinks after their dinner . After all, it's not a cheap place either. My feelings for girl and the goat have not been consistent over the years. There have been times when I didn't care for the dishes. Don't get me wrong, nothing was bad, I just wasn't impressed. Sure, my standards are higher for a restaurant that's as hyped as this. However, service was always top notch even though the place was non-stop bustling. <br><br>I often review restaurants after trying it once. That one time could've been really good, or it might've been an off night, and it was terrible. Maybe they're consistently good. Or consistently bad. But for most of the time, I don't have that information to fully assess the place b/c I don't dine there enough. However across the many dining experiences I've had here, I can confidently say that girl and the goat truly lives up to its hype! My favorites are their desserts and cocktails. That butterscotch crumble is phenomenal. Every cocktail I've tried is tasty. And I've tried a lot of drinks here. I've also sampled different dishes since their menu rotates. I'd say the standouts are probably what everyone else loves - wood oven roasted pig face, grilled octopus, roasted beets, roasted cauliflower with pickled peppers. I'm not a fan of lamb but my fiancÃ© is crazy about it. He's tried everything from the goat carpaccio to liver mousse, confit goat belly and empanadas and has nothing but great things to say. <br><br>Needless to say, I'm a huge fan. Make your reservation months in advance so you don't miss out on the most reviewed restaurant in Chicago. It's most reviewed for a very good reason.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Okay, so where do I start? I came here with my bf to celebrate his graduation.

I believe the waiter also brings out your dishes in a particular manner so that the flow of the taste has this harmonious collaboration. Ordered 3 different dishes and each dish got better and better. And the last dish heavenly perfected the end of the meal. Don't be dissuaded by the goat. I'm not a big goat fan due to the gamy taste, but it was amazing!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Friend from NYC was in town. She really wanted to check out this place. Miraculously a reservation came up for 9:45 on the day of and it would be perfect timing based on her flight. With all my good luck of being able to score a reservation literally hours before I should've gone to the casino. <br><br>Anyways, first comment is going to be about the ambiance. The atmosphere is GREAT. I loved it here. It was lively. Although we didn't have the best seat in the house, I still felt like there was never a dull moment of silence due to the great ambiance. <br><br>Service was phenomenal too. Waiter was very attentive even to the tiniest of details with much wit as well. Water was constantly poured. Although service could've been a bit quicker, I am not going to complain due to the restaurants business. <br><br>For drinks I got my go to drink, the Old Fashion. I really enjoyed. Just wish there weren't so many ice cubes in my drink....drives me insane when that happens...especially at a nice place like Girl and the Goat.<br><br>Now on to what matters, the food! <br><br>First we got the Chickpea Fritters. When I think of Chickpeas I think of those circle things in middle eastern food. But this dish came out in tofu like squares. And it was extremely delicious! With the fruit it had the perfect balance! 5 out of 5 stars!<br><br>Second we got the Hamachi Crudo. This was a dish out of left field. The waiter recommended it to us. After we had it I questioned to my friend if waiters/waitresses get commission based on what doesn't sell well. Lol. This dish just didn't mesh at all with the rest of the dishes that were on the menu. It was like eating sashimi at a steak place. It was just weird. Wasn't a fan. 3 out of 5 stars. <br><br>Third we got the Goat Empanadas. I have no idea what goat tastes like but this dish was great. Extremely tasty balance of everything on it was GREAT. 5 out of 5 stars. <br><br>4th Dish. Wood roasted pig face. Did I tell you I love pork? I love pork. This dish was great. Crispy melt in your mouth pork. Sooooo good. I don't even know what pig face would taste like but after having pig face here, I'm getting pig face everywhere. 5 out of 5 stars. <br><br>5th Dish. Crisp Braised Pork Shank. This was a really good dish. The naan was surprisingly incredible that came with it. I really liked the buttermilk dressing with the Naan but the buffalo kimchi sauce...did not taste anything like kimchi. It was weird. 4.5 out of 5 stars. I think the execution could be better but I ain't no master chef so don't take this too seriously. <br><br>Dessert we got Blueberry Bourbon baba again recommended by our waiter. Again, I think he takes a commission for what doesn't sell. This dish was not good. It tasted weird. The bourbon made the dish extremely sour. It just didn't mesh in my mouth. Blah. 2.5 out of 5 stars. <br><br>All in all I had a great experience. I wish we ordered more variety because the 2 pork dishes we ordered at the end seemed a bit too much. Something was missing from the 5 dishes we ordered. Maybe take out the Hamachi and go with a veggie dish or a seafood/pasta dish. All in all a solid experience. I'll definitely come back.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/No7Kju9ZfSBAJ9RRvLmwmQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "Old fashion.

I was lucky enough to book 3 seats but took me a month in advance.<br><br>This restaurant is great in all aspects. Their service is on point with everything. They bring out their dishes one after another and present each one along with it's ingredients. This restaurant is family-style so most dishes are shared and are at a small portion. Me and my friends decided to order two each from their unique menu.<br><br>We started with goat empanadas which the meat was tender and full of flavor. It had the texture of pulled pork. Next, came the thick scallop cubes which were meaty and sautÃ©ed to perfection. Third, came the escargot ravioli which had this nice garlic sauce and along came pig hearts which were tiny and slightly meaty. The hearts were grilled but wasn't worth it to me (Too pricey for something tiny..literally). The pig face came next which was one of my favorites. The egg yolk on top breaks within the meat and provides this nice texture. The meat is full of flavor and has this fatty taste which is delicious. Finally the last part but my favorite, the pork shank which is a deep fried whole pork shank similar to Filipino style crispy pata. The meat is tender inside but crispy from the outside. The naan could be a lot better; it was a bit bland and too soft which to me, didn't pair well. <br><br>Overall, this place is definitely worth it and a must eat in Chi-town. Don't leave this city without eating here. The menu is unique and their bartenders do an excellent job with cocktails. I suggest ordering some drinks and sipping it at the bar before getting seated.

Read on for details.<br><br>When I knew I was going to visit Chicago, it was a requirement to visit G&TG. Stephanie Izard has been my favorite Top Chef since her first appearance and just to dine in one of her restaurants has been a dream of mine. I showed up, sans reservations, and was able to find a place at the bar extension. My waiter gave me a menu and put a dot next to which items could be ordered in half-sizes. He suggested that I order four things, so I ordered:<br>- sauteed green beans (half order)<br>- wood grilled broccoli (half order)<br>- springy focaccia<br>- goat empanada (half order)<br><br>The man next to me had also ordered the green beans and I realized once his were delivered that a half order would be way too much for me. I jokingly said that we should have shared one order, and he agreed. A few minutes later, another man sat down across from us, also on his own and sitting at the bar. After my next course was delivered, a woman sat to my right and the four of us started chatting. I shared my broccoli and focaccia with our group and we all tasted sips of each others drinks. Slowly but surely, we added to our ragtag group of Misfit Toys until there were 9 of us passing our apps and drinks, insisting that everyone get a bite of this or that. Not counting the drinks, by the end of the night I had also tasted:<br>- shishito peppers<br>- escargot ravioli<br>- seared diver scallops<br>- duck tartare<br>- blueberry bourbon baba<br>....and so many others that I forgot to write down. <br><br>It got to the point where even our fearless bartender started throwing extra servings our way to accommodate the growing crowd of strangers. <br><br>This was, by far, the most expensive meal I've ever eaten solo. Granted, I did spend $20 on spices to bring home and another $30 on drinks, so I guess it actually wasn't that expensive.<br><br>I know firsthand now why Stephanie is both a Top Chef and Iron Chef victor.

It's the most yelped restaurant in all of Chicago and the co-owner/chef -<br>Stephanie Izard, just took the Iron Chef Gauntlet crown 4 days ago. Is this enough to convince you to try this place out?<br><br>We knew it was going to be hard to score a table without any reservations so we moved around our schedule and made sure to arrive here by 4:30pm (right when they open). We were 10 mins early and there were already a few parties inside waiting. Already a crowd waiting before opening? I already knew I was in for a sweet deal. When they were ready to seat people, we checked in and they had a communal table open for us. This was a pretty cool concept as they sat parties of 2 at a long table that could seat 8 in total. This gives the opportunity to mingle and talk with those around you and also gives you a sneak peak of the action in the kitchen.<br><br>Our server was great - gave us some recommendations and every dish that was brought out was quickly briefed to us on what was in it/how to eat it. If you're coming with a friend, the suggestion is to order 4 total dishes to share. Everything is family style here and is meant for sharing. Apparently, the most popular dish here is the Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face, but the Crisp Braised Pork Shank is also up there and since our server couldn't help us decide between the two, we decided to get both! Along with these two, we ordered the Pan Roasted Halibut and the Escargot Ravioli. <br><br>The first dish to come out was the Escargot Ravioli. The ravioli is paired with a very rich, salty broth, as well as some fried onions sprinkled on top. The broth though salty, had an interesting flavor, one that we've never had before. It was also our first time trying escargot and it had a unique taste to it. I think the broth was the main component to this dish - it really tied all the flavors together. Was the escargot amazing? Good, but not amazing, in my opinion. The Pan Roasted Halibut was second, and this had a mix of mushrooms and asparagus all paired with an Asian fusion peanut sauce. It was a nice juicy piece of halibut which I appreciated!<br><br>Now, the dishes that stole our hearts: Pig Face and Pork Shank.... The Roasted Pig Face was so unique and flavorful that we were too scared to finish the plate. Every bite was more delicious than the last. The Pig Face gets its name from the patty that is made by the meat from a pigs head. It's meant to eat like a hash, so you mix together the patty with a sunny side up egg as well as the crunchy potato strings. They really hit it out of the park with this one, if you're having a hard time deciding what to order, do yourself a favor and order this. Truly phenomenal. The Pork Shank was no laughing matter either. It came with a side of naan and the pork was fall off the bone, with a crispy skin all around. Every piece was juicy and tender. It was paired with two dipping sauces, but we felt the pork was better by itself. <br><br>Overall, this restaurant definitely lives up to it's fame. My only complaints would be small portions and high prices. However, given the setting and the quality of the food, that's expected. We can see why you would need to reserve months in advance to get a table here. Will be back for some pig face!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AlHP4mRFXGRZzGfU64iMyQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "Sweet and Spicy Brioche Bread"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ejASYRMSLQU0lpFTwgp4XA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Escargot Ravioli"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vcwJeulfsvgiLGEKIckpCQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Pan Roasted Halibut"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Had an absolutely amazing experience here. The ambience is warm, the service friendly and the food bountiful and savoury. I can't remember the last time I had such a wonderful experience accompanied by great food. We made reservations approx 3 weeks in advance. If you are dining with 1 other person, ask for the \"chef's table\". Essentially, this is a front row seat by the open kitchen and grants you and your guest the opportunity to watch the kitchen staff of about 10 chefs (5 men, 5 women) put together some of the most wonderful food creations known to mankind. The great thing? We did not ask for the chef's table but were graciously afforded this opportunity...just because. Since we had to wait (all of 10 mins) to be seated our waiter said that we would get a dish \"on the house.\" Well, that could not have been further from the truth. We ordered 5 share dishes off the menu...and got 10. Outstanding. The 5 extra menu items were called \"minis\" which meant the dishes were not full courses. Could have fooled me. Although we were 2, we were unable to finish any of our dishes. So, be prepared to deal with first world issues of the inability to eat everything on your plate. Since this was one meal in a lifetime, I was not guilted into thinking about world hunger and enjoyed the sumptuous spread. Everything from the broccoli to the cauliflower to the sweet onion bread was amazing. Â There are many choices for the vegetarian, considering my guest and I do not eat chicken, beef or goat. Â You are bound to find something you like on their electic menu. Â Wish this experience could be gotten in Toronto...

On the night of, this place was PACKED!! But for good reason as you'll soon see! <br><br>To begin, the service was awesome. We came in, gave my name that the reso was under, and were seated almost immediately. The vibe was super chill and casual, and they even had a couch area for people who wanted to lounge around. <br><br>The drink menu was pretty diverse, with a bunch of IPAs and hipster beers, along with your usual wine menu and some pretty unique cocktails. <br><br>Now to the food... the star of the show! Here's the thing, coming into a Top Chef (and now Iron Chef) restaurant, you've got some pretty high expectations. I would say most dishes will definitely blow your tastebuds<br><br>sautÃ©ed green beans with fish sauce vinaigrette. cashews: This was simply delicious. Such a simple dish with a few ingredients, but executed so flawlessly. The beans were perfectly cooked, and the fish sauce vinaigrette was not too salty, nor too sweet and went very well with the beans. Cashews added a very nice crunch. Very good portion size for 2. 5/5<br><br>roasted cauliflower with pickled peppers. pine nuts. mint: This was sooo delicious. Who would have thought you could cook vegetables, let alone cauliflower, so flavourful!!! The mint added an amazing punch of flavour, with a nice zing of acidity from the pickled peppers. What a play on textures and flavours! 5/5<br><br>duck tartare gooseberries . pickled mushrooms . gochujang mayo . cracklins . duck fat lavish: Another homerun dish!! The duck tartare was prepared perfectly and garnished with the mayo, mushrooms, gooseberries, etc. on the side so you can mix as much or as little as you wanted to. It came with 3 or 4 big crispy crackers (i.e. cracklins) that you topped with the tartare. It wasn't as gamey as I would have expected and the texture was amazing with so much going on. 5/5<br><br>confit goat belly bourbon butter . lobster and crab . fennel: This was a special of the day at the time, but looks like they may have made it a regular menu item. the goat belly was similar to pork belly, except with a little bit of gaminess. Completely melt in your mouth, and the lobster and crab were also perfectly cooked. Everything in this dish came so well together including the fennel that gave the dish a good crunch and liquorice flavour. Only thing that could have made this better was reducing the amount of butter in the dish... it was literally a pool of butter at the bottom. 5/5 <br><br>wood oven roasted pig face with sunny side egg. tamarind. cilantro . red wine-maple . potato stix: OK. Everyone said this was amazing on the reviews, BUT I would say this was actually the dish we least enjoyed. It was good nonetheless, but maybe it was because we already had so much great food! You mix the egg in with bunch of crispy roasted pig chunks and potato sticks, and sort of becomes a crispy mush. I think it could have used a lot more cilantro to freshen up the overall dish as it was quite rich. 4/5<br><br>chocolatey - chocolate cake shiitake gelato: By dessert, we were insanely stuffed. But we knew we just had to order the most-raved about dessert. Luckily we ordered this cake because it was such an amazing finish to an already great meal. The cake was similar to a chocolate lava cake, with oozy chocolate filling inside. The shiitake gelato tasted EXACTLY like the mushrooms, and it was all topped with a crispy chocolate crunch topping and vanilla cream sauce. I wish I had some of this right now! 5/5<br><br>Overall, the flavours were amazing and the portion sizes were surprisingly large. I think Izard would completely kill it (in a good way) if she were to open a fine-dining establishment. She's got a very unique take on mixing flavours and it seems to be working incredibly well. She's taking risks on flavour and I think that's what makes her a killer chef.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/evjvWwSmKJyTVuAEBxZ_HQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "chocolatey - chocolate cake shiitake gelato"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oexQ-uuEXYnBoU1UodwW2w/168s.jpg", "caption": "confit goat belly bourbon butter . lobster and crab . fennel"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ji5KPPULnVHl3H1xgGQF3w/168s.jpg", "caption": "wood oven roasted pig face with sunny side egg. tamarind. cilantro . red wine-maple . potato stix"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "This place was amazing.

Â My husband and I secured an early seating on a Saturday evening (4:45pm to be exact) to celebrate our wedding anniversary as I have been dying to dine here. Â First off, it is near impossible to get a weekend reservation, and people are not lying when they say the secure their months in advance. Â The restaurant opened at 4:30pm and by 5:15pm it was already packed so you should secure a reservation, or you will be fighting for the limited bar seats. Â <br><br>The ambiance in here is extremely trendy, and the restaurant itself is a very open space concept. Â Because it is small tables are essentially on top of one another to try to accommodate as many guests at one time as possible. Â I do enjoy creeping on other people's food orders so to that extent it was perfect seating--getting up to use the restroom though was slightly complicated. Â I liked the open kitchen concept. Â It was fun to look over to see the team hard at work whipping up delightful treats!<br>I love tapas style restaurants, and Girl & the Goat puts out an amazing variety of creative plates, but I feel there are other restaurants in Chicago like Purple Pig that do creative tapas style plates just as well! Â Don't get me wrong, Stephanie Izard and her team are doing amazing things, but I do feel the restaurant is overhyped. Â I do think part of the appeal is getting one of their coveted reservations, which is why this place is a \"must dine\". Â I think it is a creative culinary experience you should opt to have at least once, but there are other restaurants that dish out the same level of creativity. <br><br>The service here is excellent. Â Gerson was our service, and he was on point. Â Very friendly, and informative. Â But, the entire team here seems to work as a well-oiled machine from the host to the kitchen staff. Â  No water glass or drink ever sat empty, and the plates were promptly cleared once courses were finished. Â The service was very impressive.<br><br>The food was extremely creative, and very enjoyable. Â I loved that the menu was split up by the main component of the dish so veggie, fish, meat, bread, goat, oysters and dessert. Â I LOVE that there is a whole section of the menu dedicated to goat dishes. Â I think that is what sets this place apart from other tapas style restaurants. Â The cocktail menu was also diverse and well made. Â My favorite was the best of 3. <br><br>We ordered the following items: roasted beets, hamachi crudo, goat carpaccio, duck tongue, pig face, vitelo tonnato, confit goat belly, Milk stout tiramisu and malt balls. Â The roasted beets and pig face were my least favorite. Â The pig face was mentioned in A LOT of reviews, so I felt like we had to try it. Â I think it's one of the most boring items on their menu in terms of creativity. Â It seemed to just be flavorless and over salted. Â The beet salad fell flat in the flavor department. Â It was fine, but after eating so many other flavorful items on their menu it just had no wow factor.<br><br> My favorite dishes were the vitelo tonnato and the confit goat belly. Â Both were dishes that were packed with flavor, and I did not want them to end. Â That's the saddest part about small plates, when you find something you love it's over so soon! Â The veal tartare was simply divine--the flavors exploded in your mouth, and it was served with house made potato chips. Â The saltiness of the chips was a perfect complement to the raw veal. Â The confit goat belly interested me because it was served with shellfish. Â The flavor combination between the goat belly and lobster was delicious, and the bourbon butter sauce wrapped the entire dish up perfectly. The duck tongue was also another unique concept that we really enjoyed. Â All the raw dishes were uniquely prepared and extremely flavorful. Â I would really love to try more of the goat themed plates. Â <br><br>As for the dessert the malt balls were the extremely unexpected favorite. Â The combo of the caramel corn and ice cream was a great surprise. Â The tiramisu was served very creatively in a coffee cup, but the flavors were just ok. Â I think the milk stout took away from the sweet liquor taste of standard tiramisu. Â <br><br>All in all our dining experience at Girl & the Goat was great. Â Their menu is extremely creative, and the food was well prepared. Â Service is also top notch. Â It is a great restaurant, but I wish reservations were more easily accessible. Â There are also other restaurants in the city that dish out creative tapas as well as Girl & the Goat, which is why I think it is overhyped a bit! Â Everyone who enjoys creative small plates should visit the Goat just once!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NHq3DyqftVKVMJ3ziH3UrQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "Vitelo Tonnato (veal tartare)"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HYeye83i8H_PNDzSQglpHw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Beet Salad"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/188c6RXYNb2POMx7B21bTQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Pig Face"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Visiting from LA I was so excited to find out my friend scored a reservation for the group of us.

We arrived around 8 for a reservation for 8:15, it took us over a half hour to get seated because of the table we were supposed to be seated at was taking their sweet time to leave! So we grabbed a drink at the bar and the hostess came by and explained the menu so we could order once we were seated. Our waiter and host were both very helpful and were trying their best to get the other party moving. Since all items on the menu are shareable items, our host recommended about 5-7 dishes for our party of 4. The menu is divided by Veggies, Fish and Meat entrees which is helpful in ensuring you're able to experience a variety of dishes. Our party of 4 tried 4 entrees (we ordered 2 of the same dishes for a total of 5 entrees). Â <br><br>We started with the Goat Empanadas, which were AMAZING. The goat is flavorful and the empanada is just the perfectly crispy, it will literally melt in your mouth. The sea bass was brought out next, it was flaky and flavorful but the aftertaste was a bit off, so out of the 4 dishes, I would say it was my least favorite. Lastly, the calamari bruschetta and the crisp braised pork shank came out together. Both of these were PHENOMENAL. The braised pork shank is cooked to perfection. The pork literally falls off the bone and its paired perfectly with the crispy naan and buttermilk ranch. We ordered two thinking since the dishes are on the smaller side we would need the extra order but boy were we wrong, this has to be one of the largest dishes on the menu and it's easily shareable by a large party (just order extra naan). The calamari bruschetta is also another must try. The calamari is grilled and not fried which is a plus and it is paired with apple, ricotta cheese and goat bacon on top of perfectly toasted bread. It's an amazing combination of flavors and totally unexpected.<br><br>Overall, I would say the food, service and ambience are all a 5/5.

Reserve early plz. <br>Arguably the 2nd hottest restaurant in Chicago (after Alinea of course), Girl and the Goat is unique in many elements. The food here is creative, the ordering system is tapas-esque, and service rivals that of a high Michelin-starred establishment. <br><br>Our table of 7 broke up into groups of 4 and 3. The ordering system threw our groups into disarray, as we weren't sure how much food we would have to order to leave full. However, our waiter was extremely helpful and friendly with us, recommending the popular dishes and greatly calming the chaos. The service stayed consistently excellent throughout our meal.<br><br>My group of 3 ordered the Pan Fried Shishito peppers, Calamari Bruschetta, Escargot Ravioli, Pig Face, Goat Belly, and some Citrus Brioche for some extra carbs. <br><br>Our dishes came out one by one, so we were able to sample everything by itself before polluting our tongues with another flavor. Our favorites were the Pig Face, Calamari Bruschetta, and the Goat Belly. The pan fried peppers had a nice char, roasted flavor to them, and they worked well as a vegetable counterpart to all the meat we ordered. The Escargot Ravioli was disappointing, both in terms of size and flavor. The ravioli were extremely small, and because of this, the escargot wasn't very noticeable. With escargot being such a niche and interesting ingredient, I felt like it could have been highlighted better. The broth that came with the ravioli was arguably the best part of the dish. <br><br>The Pig Face was special. The wonderful egg, the crispy potato, and the pig itself were all extremely memorable. It was our unanimous favorite. The presentation is also stunning in its own right. <br><br>The group of 4 ordered similar dishes, with the addition of the Green Beans and Pork Shank. Both these dishes were delicious as well, and I felt like they were great representations of the quality of Girl and the Goat. <br><br>Is the food pretentious? I suppose it can be to some eyes. The fine line between creativity and pretentiousness is something that Chef Izard handles gracefully, as the food pushes boundaries without seemingly destroying them. <br><br>Our meal wasn't cheap. The per person breakdown was over $30, but I left satisfied knowing I had sampled the amazing variety that Girl and the Goat had to offer. <br><br>In the days afterward, my friend wouldn't stop shouting out \"Pig Face\" whenever I asked him what he wanted to eat.

Next came the calamari bruschetta which was so visually appealing, no less than three people asked what it was. The calamari was some of the freshest I've ever had and paired perfectly with the lightly toasted bread and other toppings. Finally the signature pig's face - not to worry hear, no actual resemblance to the face of a pig - simply some of the best pork anything I have ever had.

I really wanted to try a few other cocktails but we had things to do after our meal. <br><br>Trevor took us through the menu and gave us recommendations and assisted in suggestions and possibilities for my girlfriend's dairy allergy. Â He was extremely helpful. This place has small plates that are meant to share with one another, such an awesome concept.

My mouth is literally still watering from this dish two weeks later, I was so happy I ordered this. Â It was on my radar before arriving to the restaurant after looking at the menu online. I want another one!! Â <br>Because this dish was made with butter and my girlfriend couldn't share, our server Trevor dropped off a small portion of the Kohlrabi Salad for her to enjoy. Â It was made with Fennel, Evalon, Toasted almonds, Roasted shiitake and Blueberries. Â It was such a nice gesture and she really loved the salad while I indulged on my Halibut. She let me try her salad, it was very very good.<br><br>Finally, we ordered the Crisp Braised Pork Shank, with Buttermilk dressing, Grilled spring onion & radish kimchi with Naan. Â This was so damn good because of the crispiness on the outside was perfection, very very impressed. Â The Naan bread was so fluffy and delicious we almost ordered another piece. Â Best Naan we've ever ate, hands down!<br><br>As we were approaching the possibility of dessert, we realized we had to get going to get on our Architectural Boat Tour of the city that was boarding in 20 minutes. Â We asked for the check because we didn't have much time, and right before the check arrived, Trevor came by to drop off a side of the blackberry sorbet (I think) because my girlfriend was intrigued by this item.

Â The restaurant was laid out and decorated nicely - it was loud and lively but surprisingly not so much that you have to yell at the person across from you to hold conversation. Â I loved the ambiance, the vibe, the decor and the open kitchen. Â The seats were a bit off, especially for the bf cause the table and chair height seemed off and a little too short for his frame to be comfortable. Â We weren't super hungry because we had a snack around 7pm to hold us over before our super late reservation. Â <br><br>We ordered the:<br>* Puttin on a Spritz Cocktail - Chicago Distilling Ceres Vodka . Aperol . Pamplemousse Rose . Lemon . Grapefruit Tonic . Sparkling Wine - this drink was so amazingly delicious. Â One of the best cocktails I've had, though I didn't taste the alcohol and it tasted like juice. Â Could be dangerous but I'm not sure it had very much alcohol in it cause it was so deceiving.<br>* Sauteed Green Beans - Fish sauce vinaigrette. Cashews - The server told us this was the only dish on their menu that has been on there since the restaurant opened years ago, so we definitely had to try it especially cause I love green beans and string beans (if you can't tell from all my posts). Â The green beans were cooked perfectly. Â The fish sauce vinaigrette was so unique as were the addition of cashews. Â It wasn't a flavor I've ever tasted before and we loved it.<br>* Escargot Ravioli - Bacon tamarind sauce. Escarole and celery. Crispy onions - I love love love escargots so when I saw this on the menu, I wanted to have it. Â I was slightly disappointed cause the bacon tamarind sauce was a bit too salty and you can't taste the escargot (or the typical garlic butter escargots you learn to expect). Â I didn't love this dish and the filling was too small for the pasta size. Â <br>* Crisp Braised Pork Shank - Buttermilk dressing. Grilled spring onion and radish kimchi. Naan - I love the their take on this. Â The pork was crispy on the outside, as if you were eating chicharron. Â You can tell it was brasied and then deep fried cause of the perfect soft fall off the bone meat and the crispiness of the skin. Â You wrap the meat in naan, though it was more like a pita than a naan, and then you add the radish kimchi sauce, grilled spring onion and you have sorta a \"bao\". Â This dished reminded me of the white bao and peking duck AND it tasted like it too. Â I liked it.

I appreciated their dedication to being prompt, but that connection with our own personal waitress was missing. I look for that when I go to restaurants.

Made a reservation 3 months beforehand and our options were already very limited. Basically we chose between a 5pm or 9pm meal so we opted for the latter. The service during our visit was average. Waitress was polite but not particularly friendly.<br><br>For dishes my friend and I semi-shared the following:<br>-Brioche w/ Sambal butter & lamb jam: This place seems to be known for their elevated breads and they did not disappoint. The sambal butter was very light and had the slightest kick to it. It was just the right flavor to balance out the bread's sweetness or to go with the lamb jam. Personally I would have liked it a bit stronger though. The brioche itself is full of butter. The texture is amazing and at the end of your bite, your mouth still has a coat of butteriness enveloping your taste buds. And if that's not enough fatty goodness for you, the lamb jam will give you another dose of fatty sweet flavor. (4/5)<br><br>-Duck Tartare: My absolute favorite dish of the night. I love duck in all it's forms but I've never had it raw and I wish I had tried this sooner. The duck has a bit more bite to it compared to raw beef or fish but it's still not tough. The pickled gooseberries and fried brussels sprouts add a variety of textures and flavors to the dish too. Despite everything that this dish has going on, it's still a very clean tasting dish. Also the duck fat lavash is out of this world. The duck fat in it doesn't make it heavy but it certainly makes them addictive. If I could I would purchase a giant box of these to take home with me and use it on every spread I have (5/5)<br><br>-Goat Liver Mousse: If you don't like goat, can't deal with liver, or all the above, this dish is not for you. However if you love a good pate and can take your gamey meats, this dish will delight your tastebuds. The mousse portion was small because that's all you need but texturally it was so fluffy and creamy. It didn't have any of the grittiness that comes with bad liver. The pickles also added a nice sweet, crunch, sour component to the dish. The mousse was served with the duck fat lavash that I made clear about how obsessed I am with them. They were also served with the warmest, moistest, most delicious crumpets I could ever imagine. (4.5/5)<br><br>-Pig Face: By far my least favorite dish. I didn't hate it but it was just so average. I guess for the price it's not bad and it is filling but I wouldn't waste my 3 month reservation on this dish. (3.5/5)<br><br>-Rhubarb and Goat Cheesecake: Technically my friend's dessert but I took a few bites. It's not quite what I expected but it works. The main thing I noticed is that it's quite a savory cheesecake. It's not very sweet and the various herbal elements remind me more of savory dishes so it didn't quite satisfy my end-of-the-meal sweet tooth. It's still quite tasty but not something I would get again.

Â Despite how increasingly busy they were getting, the restaurant was still able to get us a table immediately after he arrived. I appreciated how accommodating the Girl and Goat employees were under these circumstances. <br><br>Cocktails: Pyramid Scheme and Morning Ritual. The Pyramid Scheme is a scotch based cocktail that was more on the fruity side. The smokiness from the scotch was present, but not overwhelming. The Morning Ritual was a great spicy cocktail. <br><br>Chickpea Fritter (10/10): Great Mediterranean style dish with delicious toppings on top of the fritters<br><br>Pan fried shishito peppers (10/10): I never really imagined parmesan, sesame, and miso working well with shishito peppers, but it tasted great. The portion was also generous. <br><br>Grilled Octopus (9/10): The octopus was extremely fresh tasting and cooked perfectly. <br><br>Goat Empanadas (8/10): The empanadas were good, but they wouldn't be on my list to get next time. The meat inside the empanadas didn't have the most impressive flavor. <br><br>Price Point/Value: This restaurant encourages shared plates and a majority of the dishes are about $15-$20 each. Some of the bigger meat dishes are around $25. Cocktails are $14. Breads are $5. For two people, they typically suggest that you order about 4 dishes.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I'm a Stephanie Izard Groupie, what can I say.

Â I've not encountered a single restaurant that is quite like this, and when a restaurant can say that it stands alone in the type of cuisine it is delivering, that's pretty phenomenal. Â Way to set yourself apart from the crowd, Girl & the Goat. Â I had always known there was something special about this restaurant, but could never say what it was that made it this way. Â If I'm being honest, it is still difficult to verbalize what makes this restaurant so special aside from the obvious.<br><br>With all this praise and affirmation, I have to say that I was beyond excited when my fiancÃ© asked me, \"By the way, you want to go to Girl & the Goat?\" Â Now that I have realized just how sought-after this restaurant is, it makes me laugh at how nonchalant he was when asking me if I wanted to go here. Â It makes me laugh even more when thinking of how easily we got in, but then again we did wander in here right when they opened up at 4:30pm. Â Though it was not excessively busy at this time, it was still teeming with people. Â There was an army of 10 staff members waiting at the hostess stand, seemingly just waiting to do some crowd control for the people who would be swarming in to the restaurant soon enough. Â <br><br>As it was, my fiancÃ© and I sat at the bar and had a very lovely conversation with the bartender who flattered us by asking if we were professors at UIC...the flattery made me like our bartender instantly, but he proved himself to be a great waiter. Â He made several suggestions for food, only one of which we listened to, Â and worked to ensure our entire experience was one that we wouldn't easily forget. Â Though the bartender was trying to offer a combination of light and heavy food selections, we just went all in and chose some of the richest stuff available. Â Because, you know, that's what we do. Â Go big or go home, as they say.<br><br>We ordered the gouda and bacon appetizer which was essentially the warmest loaf of bread accompanied by gouda cheese and some amazingly creative bacon-bruschetta like spread. Â It was spectacular, but not nearly as spectacular as the cuddlefish. Â I have never in my life had cuddlefish, but I've come to see the error of my ways - this is a dish I need to indulge in more often. Â However, I doubt anyone will do it up quite like here. Â This dish had such a zesty and complex flavor profile that worked like I wouldn't have expected it to. Â As much as I loved the cuddlefish, the mac-daddy of it all was the goat shank. Â Yes, there were some fatty parts to it, but for the most part this shank was cooked perfectly and the meat simply fell off the bone. Â This goat shank is one of the most luxurious things you can eat - it's somewhat simplistic, but so decadent. Â <br><br>My fiancÃ© and I split everything I mentioned, and it was plenty of food. Â Our bartender told us that people usually order 2-3 dishes for themselves, but I could not imagine this! Â Get some beers (they have Three Floyd's) and cocktails in you and you'll be bursting at the seams if you order 2-3 dishes for yourself. Â Not to mention, your wallet would also be bursting at the seams...it get's prettttty pricy here. Â The cost of the food could be an inhibitor, but everything is gourmet and this is wonderful place to celebrate occasions...so save up and splurge here! Â It's absolutely worth it.<br><br>P.S.

Their decor is as bold and globally influenced as their menu. I like the contrast between the industrial decor with all the rustic, exposed brick.

I love that the menu contains foods from all around the world. There's definitely a lot of Mediterranean influences but if you look closely at the ingredients, it's all over the place. This place is not for the non-adventurers, the picky eaters. Everything is creative and speaks to Executive Chef Stephanie Izard's spunk.

Green garlic potato pierogies - BOMB. I mean, potatoes.. wrapped in dough and fried, and garlic??? Dream come true.<br><br>2. Shishito peppers. Actually... I've had better elsewhere. But my friends liked it!<br><br>3. Goat liver mousse. It came with some pickled stuff that I didn't really touch, crisps, and some yummy toasty bread that almost felt like a fried mantou married a biscuit. Bread was BOMB lol. The mousse was good too, but I couldn't eat too much of it because it was so rich. Nice combo with the bread though.<br><br>4. Duck tongue. AWESOME dish. I'm slightly confused though, the description on the menu said tuna and black bean poke. Is it duck or is it tuna??? Cos it tasted just like tuna. Plus I didn't know people eat duck tongues.. and poke-style. BUT whatever it is, super duper tasty. The crispy wontons paired well.<br><br>5. Goat empanadas. Good.. I think? Actually I don't think this was that memorable, but still pretty good.<br><br>6. Braised beef tongue. Super tasty! I love me a good beef tongue, and theirs was cooked perfectly. Super tender and flavorful.<br><br>7. Seared diver scallops. Sooo good! I love scallops, and these were plump, sweet, and seared perfectly. It came towards the end of our meal, so I was getting kinda full by this time... but definitely a good one.<br><br>8. Grilled pork belly. Very yummy! Very nice cook and flavor, but to be honest I like pork belly in KBBQ more lol. I like my pork belly very crispy, which this wasn't, buuut still super delisssshhus though.<br><br>9. Roasted pig face! I thought it sounded very weird but then I like cabeza tacos (cow face?) which.. also sounds weird but so tasty! Turns out THIS dish was the tastiest of all. I think it was my fave for the night. It comes with a nice egg on top, which of course means yolk porn. Very rich dish, and I wish it came earlier in the dinner. I would've had more room to eat it! The pig face was super flavorful, tender, and had this.... crispy gelatinous thing going on? Hard to describe, but quite unique. Overall, TASTY AF!<br><br>10. Last dish.. calamari bruschetta.

Â Overall experience and meal exceeded my expectations. Â  Only downside was the non-dining room seating in the lounge, but surprisingly service levels was still very good there. Â Waiters still took the time to explain the menu items, provide recommendations, and were back consistently to check on drinks. Â The food itself is bursting with flavors and each dish unique. Â It's a tapas style restaurant - perfect for sharing within a party. Â Note the dishes are a bit larger than normal tapas - the restaurant recommends 2 dishes per person which we felt was just right. Â Price point was expected and we felt it was an exceptional meal for the price - overall a great experience and a must visit when in Chicago.<br><br>Unfortunately we decided to go at the spur of the moment and did not make any reservations. Â It was 10:45pm so we decided to give it a shot. Â No surprise - no seats available when we arrived - both inside and outside. Â Seemed there were seats available outside but due to the city ordinance could not seat outside anymore. Â So we decided to try give the bar lounge area a shot. Â Mentally I was prepared for other bar lounges where you had to wait long periods for mediocre service - but was pleasantly surprised when a waiter immediately attended to us for drinks. Â Great job by the restaurant to staff waiters in the lounge area and ensure great service levels there. Â At the end of the meal we were a bit uncomfortable bending over the table - but the food was worth it.<br><br>We went with the waiters recommendations for the dishes-Duck Tongue, Cauliflower, String Beans, Halibut, Galbi, oysters, calamari, hamachi crudo, and lamb ribs. Â All dishes were exceptional. Â The only one we did not enjoy fully was the raw oysters as they were a bit too briny and seasoning was a bit high on the vinegar - coincidentally this was the one dish not recommended by the waiter. Â If I was to rank our favorites - I would say duck tongue is number one as it not something typical and the flavor profile is great - never thought I would like that as I typically do not like the dry preparation in China. Â Number 2 would be the lamb ribs - amazing flavor without tons of gaminess and super fall off the bone tenderness. Â Number three would have to be the cauliflower - huge flavor - Â if you are not a big cheese fan man sure you get it on the side. Â Rest of dishes I would also recommend, but those are the three must tries for us.<br><br>Amount was perfect for a party of 5 adults and everyone left pleased.

Chef Stephanie Izard has really put together an amazing restaurant with such an eclectic menu full of bold flavors. It is highly recommended that you get a reservation way in advance or you'll be stuck with a reservation at 10:45pm...if you're lucky. Of course, you can always test your luck by just showing up without a reservation and get seated at the bar or outdoors with a bunch of strangers.

Also, the breads and desserts menus seem to change frequently. <br><br>The dishes here are meant to be shared so bring a few friends so you can order multiple things off the menu. The sweet 'n spicy brioche came with a delicious honey sambal butter and refreshing spring lamby jam. I wish I could have a jar of both the butter and jam to take home. The confit goat belly at $19 was pretty much the definition of small, pretentious food though. While tasty, it came with a small piece of goat belly with bourbon butter, lobster, crab, and fennel. I am not a huge fan of vegetables but the roasted cauliflower was a rockstar. I never knew cauliflower could be so good. The pickled peppers, pine nuts, and mint really added nice flavors to the roasted cauliflower dish. The wood oven roasted pig face was so succulent with the perfect amount of fat. It's a beautiful dish with gorgeous colors. My favorite dish of the night had to be the crisp braised pork shank. The pork was so flavorful and tender. I loved the crispy exterior because it added a lovely crunch. The made-from-scratch naan bread that it came with was the best! So warm. So soft. I could have munched on it all night.<br><br>For dessert, I opted for the donettes. Not the best choice on my part. It came with two donettes and a small scoop of ice cream. I wish it came with an extra scoop because it really balanced out the warm donette well. The entire dessert was topped off with a bleu cheese caramel that was a bit too strong for my taste. Regular caramel would have sufficed but it wouldn't have been a creative dish if it didn't have that cheesy caramel, right?<br><br>Service was amazing. Our waitress was a gem. We came around 9:00pm and got seated at a large outdoor picnic-esque table with multiple strangers so she had to deal with all of us PLUS having to deal with us moving indoors due to the unexpected rain.

A MUST go to in you're in Chicago. Its all sharing plates so please order a lot to be able to try as much as you can! It's worth it! <br><br>I ordered the roasted cauliflower (which btw, I hate veggies) and I wish the portion was bigger lol...We also ordered the red fish. Which is a soup with fish and clams. (Bit spicy) also amazing. That taste was out of this world. My FAVORITE plate was the pork shank. So tender. The waiter literally took the bone with his finger and left no meat behind on that bone. Wow!! Delicious!!!!!! I wish it was bigger!! If it weren't because I wanted to make room for dessert, I definitely would've ordered another one. What a fatty! For dessert we ordered their version of a pineapple upside down cake with bourbon ice cream. Incredible. <br><br>In order words, MAKE RESERVATIONS! You must go!

I can't stress this enough... is fantastic! They serve most of their food as a small dish to share, which is a little different than most restaurants you visit. I feel like it creates a social atmosphere to eating and gives you the opportunity to try a few things. My favorite were the Shishito Peppers and the Olive bowl (idk what they marinate those in but it's incredible) - The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the lack of vegetarian/vegan options and the price. Especially when you're dealing with small plates I feel like it would be so easy to add another option or two that a vegan/vegetarian could opt for. In addition, these small plates were priceyyyy.

Whenever I have friends visiting from out of state, I always recommend this restaurant as well, and they always loved it!<br><br>I frequent this restaurant often, the only thing I hate is that the wait is always SO LONG.

Even with a reservation a month in advance, I almost always get the remaining 9:45 or 10:00pm slots, that's how popular the restaurant is.

Soon, they served us an appetizer on the house. We were surprised, but happily accepts. After we finished our food and drinks, we were surprised to find out that the bill was $0. Our server didn't have to do that for us at all, yet he did it to make our night.

This place makes my heart so happy. I finally got to go here, as this place has been on the top of my Chicago Food Bucket List for ages now. It didn't disappoint. <br><br>The atmosphere is classy but welcoming. It's loud without being cacophonous, and it's crowded without being frustrating. The servers were very knowledgeable and kind, and our water or plates were changed in perfect timing. I was impressed. <br><br>We started off with cocktails. I ordered an \"All Becomes One\" - gin, violet, absinthe, aloe vera, earl grey crema, and lemon. It was floral and refreshing, and I really enjoyed it. My sister had a Putting on the Spritz- vodka, aperol, pamplemousse rose, lemon, grapefruit tonic, and sparkling wine. It was very grapefruity and went down smooth.<br><br>Girl and the Goat is a restaurant that has small plates. Wait staff recommended that we get 4 or 5 plates to share to start, so that's what we did. The first one to come out was the duck tongues, which were served with piri piri on top of an ahi blackbean poke with crispy wontons on top. This was easily my favorite plate of the night. The tongues are fried and crispy, with a nice salt. They're something that I could eat all day long (never thought I'd say that about tongues but here we are!). The poke underneath it was beautiful. Everything was clean and fresh, and the spice from the sauce balanced the ahi, and with the crisp of the wontons and tongues? Perfection. <br><br>After that, we moved on to escargot ravioli, served with a bacon tamarind sauce, escarole, celery, and topped with crispy onions. The plating was gorgeous. The sauce was pretty thin, and there was a lot of it, to the point it seemed more like a broth. It was good though, with thick cubes of bacon. The ravioli was perfectly cooked, but the escargot fell a bit flat. I wouldn't have been able to tell you that's what's in there, if I didn't already know. But, it was a tasty dish nonetheless, and I ate all of them.<br><br>Then we got the sautÃ©ed green beans, my sister's favorite dish. They're prepared in a fish sauce vinaigrette with onion and cashews. I thought my sister was weird for insisting we get these, because, all this food to pick from and you pick green beans? But, I get it. They were perfectly cooked, with the right amount of snap. They were salty and seasoned and the cashews gave nice crunch. Also, you get a LOT of them, it's a very generous portion for small plates. We took the rest home.<br><br>Moving on, we then received the one, the only famous Girl and the Goat wood oven roasted pig face. (Cue the Homer Simpson drooling). It was outstanding. It's served with a sunny side up egg, red wine-maple, and crispy potatoes strings. Oh man, it's like breakfast but grown up for foodies. The sauce had just the right amount of sweetness, the rich yolk from the egg covered everything in a dose of extra-deliciousness. The pig face itself was well seasoned and rich, something similar to pork belly but dare I say better.<br><br>Then we got to the actual goat, confit goat belly to be exact. It's served with a vanilla butter with lobster and crab (Note: menu online says bourbon, but we were told vanilla). I actually didn't care for this at all, and I'm disappointed that our last dish was the least enjoyed, and that the goat (for which the place is name) was the one to disappoint. The goat belly itself was nice, but the vanilla butter sauce that was covering it was not. Vanilla and pork is weird. Vanilla and goat is weird. Vanilla and goat and fish is a mistake. The sauce on its own was fine. The crab was really good. The lobster was overcooked, and on top of that I crunched down on a rather nasty piece of shell. <br><br>But, we ordered dessert, so that makes it better. We shared the caramel corn & malt balls, which consists of vanilla malt gelato, popcorn caramel, Â chocolate magic shell, and caramel corn. I thought this was a pretty good way to nod to Chicago (Garrett's and all). The caramel corn was well coated and delicious. The gelato was creamy and rich, as it should be. The caramels were super soft and addicting, and my favorite part of the plate. And then the ice cream was topped with magic shell chocolate topping. I love Iron Chef Izard even more now for using shell (if it ain't broke....). <br><br>Our total was something to the tune of 130$, reasonable for the location and quality.<br><br>Though some things were a bit disappointing here (like the goat belly), the overwhelming positives of everything else about the night outweigh it, and so I give it five stars.

In particular, the dishes that sound like they shouldn't be good... those seem to be the best.

I could eat several plates of the broccoli on my own. It's got great grilled, smoky flavor, fantastic crispiness from the rice crispy on top, and creaminess from the bleu cheese sauce.

When I was a kid, broccolis used to remind me of trees.

Just know that when the server informs you at the beginning that they will bring out the food from light to heavy, expect this to be the curtain call. Served with flame grilled Indian bread and some kind of chinese hoisin BBQ sauce, and Japanese tasting relish. Shout out to Izard for representing the Asian palette so much. <br><br>Chocolatey chocolate cake: 10/10 for the dessert, 3/10 for taking all the anticipation and guess work out with a name like that. Exactly as described, it's a moister and more intense brownie topped with more chocolate crumbs and shiiiiiitake ice cream (yeah what are we not making ice cream out of these days). <br><br>Caramel malt bombs: Think Garrett's caramelcorn, getting freaky with some vanilla ice cream, while fooling around with some malt fudge.

Duck Tongue - This dish is a perfect example of Stephanie doing a great job of using both Latin American and Asian flavors. The dish has raw tuna diced into cubes along with beans and tortilla chips. The duck tongue is cut into small pieces then fried and goes oh so well with everything. Overall, the dish does a great job of playing around with different flavors and textures.<br>2. Goat Liver Mousse - The mousse is so smooth and decadent. The bread (or crumpet) that goes with it super addicting. The bread is slightly sweet, chewy and soft. <br>3. Roasted Beets - Super refreshing and a good dish to clean your palate. <br>4. Pig Face - This dish is topped with an egg. The meat is super tender and juicy - can be a little fatty and heavy. <br>5. Goat Confit - The goat meat is super tender here as well; however, it is a little gamey for me. If you like gamey, then you'll love this dish!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Y9qW2s-FpKDq4DIUr3WmLQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "Duck tongue"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xL0IETrDCabtJH8nLq0U1w/168s.jpg", "caption": "Pig face"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oi4xjX8WMJhxcKdmgbfFAQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Beet salad"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "This goes into my top 10 best evah meals.

I've been here before, but during the winter months, but the review is based on my experience on 6/3/17. First off, the reservation was made 90 days in advance.

FYI...we were a group of three. Here's what we ordered and the rating:<br><br>**Mahalo Cocktail- Be warned that cocktails here are strong, but very good. This was the most like a tropical drink and it was very good, but had a spicy kick, so you've been warned...<br><br>My friends are wine and beer drinkers and they were very impressed with both selections. One friend ordered a Blood Orange IPA and she loved it, and the other a cocktail.<br><br>**Sweet & Spicy Brioche- This was the only item that I felt like was okay. I thought the honey butter & jelly would be better.<br><br>**Chickpea Fritters- Very yummy and crispy on the outside and oh so soft and creamy on the inside. I'm not a Vegan, however, this would be a great alternative to anything cheesy.<br><br>**Spring Onion Potato Pierogies- Has a great smoky flavor and my friend who makes homemade pierogies was impressed.<br><br>**Goat Empanadas- These are excellent. One of the favorites of the night. Be aware that the order only comes with 2, but our waiter let us order 3 since we were a group of three. I ordered these last time I went and they were even better than I remembered...<br><br>**Woodfire Glazed Lamb Ribs- Very good, but I thought it would be better. I prefer Greek-style lamb<br><br>**Pork Shank- This is the best thing ever. It's delicious and as long as you eat pork, this is a must have!<br><br>We were still hungry so we each ordered a dessert and shared them evenly. We ordered: Chocolatey - Chocolate Cake w/ Shiitake gelato, Caramel corn & malt balls, and Rhubarb & goat cheese Bavarian.

Originally had a reservation for 11:30 but checked in earlier and they texted us at around 10:40. We walked back and got seated within minutes. They split their menus into vegetables, fish, and meat. On a smaller menu they had their goat dishes. We ordered the raw Kusshi oysters, goat empanadas, pork shank, and pig face (received in this order). <br><br>The raw Kusshi were the only raw oysters. These specific oysters were sweet and come with 4 in an order. Â I would definitely order again. The empanadas came next, even more delicious than the oysters. They were very crispy on the outside but didn't have that oily feel to it that I expected. They were topped with blueberries and avocados, which added a light sweet touch to it. The meat with tender and has a blast of flavor. Next, came the pork shank. This was the best of the meal. The shank had been cooked for over 12 hours, which allowed the meat to melt off the bone. It came with some naan and two sauces, buttermilk and kimchi buffalo. Personally I liked the kimchi buffalo sauce more, tangy with a tiny kick. The whole combination was without a doubt perfect. Last, we got the wood oven roasted pig face, which came with a sunny side up egg and some potato stix. Personally, I wasn't a huge fan of this dish but I'm glad I got to try it. The face pieces mainly just felt really fatty, but super soft and flavorful. The potato stix were super crispy and complemented the pig face nicely. <br><br>Service was on point. Our server made excellent suggestions, empanadas and shank, and he even came to tell us that the kitchen was closing in 15 minutes and for us to get any other orders in! I came with just one friend and we weren't able to finish everything, and the bill was a bit high. Â I'd say come with a group of friends so you can order and try a bit of everything, and not drop too much.<br><br>***<br>Came back again and had new experience. My friend called in to make a reservation for 9:30, but we got to the area and checked in early and the hostess actually told us her name wasn't on the list. We ended up just putting our name down and waited for maybe about 1.5 hours, which wasn't terrible. The wait gave us time to show our visitor to a couple more spot around the area. Once we checked back in, the hostess told us, she wanted to thank us for waiting so long, and for the possible confusion with the original reservation, by sitting us at the chef's table, which was perfect for three of us. <br><br>Rodrigo was our server and he gave excellent suggestions and explained why he liked them. I told my friends we had to order the shank. We also ordered the broccoli, duck tartare, and the confit goat belly. While all were delicious, I probably wouldn't order the broccoli again. The duck tartare was delcious and was a nice combination with the mushroom and vegetables that it came with. One of my friends absolutely hates raw meat, but says she enjoyed this! The best dish of the night was the confit goat belly. This dish was pretty small but it was an explosion of flavor once you got a bite of it. I'm not a huge fan of lobster or crab, but something about them together made it work. Lastly, we got the caramel corn and malt balls dessert. To be honest, I don't think any of us wanted dessert but Rodrigo suggested it and we have no regrets! The combination of the textures was fascinating. The gelato was so smooth but the popcorn caramel and chocolate brought a slight crunchiness. <br><br>While sitting at the chef's table we were able to talk with a couple of the chefs and hear their suggestions. We talked mostly to Alberto who convinced us to get the confit goat belly. He was very patient answering our questions and enthusiastic about explaining the dishes.. He also told us about the most popular dishes and ones we might want to try the next time we go! LAMB RIBS, I'M COMING FOR YOU NEXT!!!<br><br>Yes to Confit Goat Belly.

Came with 4 for a birthday dinner and we really went all out; ordered 9 dishes and sat with bated breath for it all to come out. The menu is small but focused; there are essentially 5 sections with a few offerings in each one; Breads, Goat, Vegetables, Seafood, Meat. We ordered 2 of everything except 1 vegetable. Every dish had a baseline level of quality that was high; presentation and service were attentive as to be expected. That said if you were to ask me which ones I think were worth it to get on repeat visits I would say much of it was hit or miss. <br><br>Breads: A must if you want to fill up at an affordable price. Each is $5, and they come with very different breads. We had incredibly fluffy biscuits with a delicious whipped butter and savory jam, along with a crispy toasted brioche with salmon cream cheese and a giardinera that paired perfectly together.<br><br>Goat: Had the Goat belly confit and the Goat pate. The goat pate was...interesting. It came with essentially a large cracker and a bunch of incredibly butter and fluffy rillettes. The actual pate itself was very distinctly flavored with goat, and I think required the accompanying pickled ingredients to balance out its fattiness. On it's own I think the pate was an overwhelming flavor. I'm not sure if I would be able to handle it again. As for the goat belly confit, I had mixed opinions. It was topped with lobster and crab in this light and delicate sauce, and all the components individually where great. I'm just didn't really get the combination together; especially since for a dish that was supposed to highlight the goat belly I didn't really get a big feeling that It was the star.<br><br>Veggies: Got the seared broccoli over blue cheese. Actually quite liked this, would be happy eating this again or trying the green beans(which were also recommended and looked good as well)<br><br>Meats: We got the pig face and the Duck Tongue. Both were great; despite having fried components they still maintained much of the juiciness and fullness of fatty components melded together with delicious sauces and softer textures. Some of our favorites for the night<br><br>Seafood: Soft-shell crab and halibut. To preface, both had pretty small portions; the soft shell crab was essentially one crab partitioned into 4-5 parts; the halibut was a small slice which was cooked perfectly, and served on top of a mixed blueberry and fish sauce base. I think the soft-shell crab was phenomenal actually; crispy as expected but the interior was juicier than any I've ever had. It was a small portion but each bite was worth every dollar. The halibut I felt was a bit more ordinary. The blueberry and fish sauce combination tasted alright, but ultimately wsn't a flavor combo that wowed me. And as for the fish itself, it was moist and flaky, though I was looking for some crispy component(I'm looking for skin here), which was absent.<br><br>All in all, I think Girl and Goat is very good, but also a bit overrated. While all the dishes are good, whether or not you will be amazed by certain ones are subject to variability. On the other hand, I was more full than I expected to be. $30 per person got me stuffed, and for high-class tapas, you are not doing bad if you come here for fine dining.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I was visiting Chicago and this was the first time I had a shot at a Michelin Star dining experience near where I was.

Leaving with a full belly of disappointment, I really think this place was overrated. The pricing and portion can definitely be improved.<br><br>I rushed here at 5pm as a walk-in, and got seated immediately. Inside the restaurant was pretty noisy, so we chose to sit at the patio. We quickly checked Yelp to make sure we don't miss out on signature dishes, and orderd the followings:<br>+ kohlrabi salad: the only thing that was outstanding. The dressing was on the heavy side, but the subtle hint of blue cheese worked wonder with thinly sliced kohlrabi.<br>+ sweet brioche: it started to go down hill from here. Â It came with some green butter which had no taste, and caramelized onion. Â The bread had a disappointing texture, and the slightly sweet taste just didn't go well with the really savory menu. <br>+ goat empanadas: a good dish, but not like, mind-blowingly good, for a place that literally has the word 'goat' in its name. I think it's tough to make good empanadas because the fried corn taste can easily overpower the filling, and they didn't deliver a good empanada here. Â The mushroom plated on the side was actually the star of the dish, and helped balance the heavy corn taste and dry goat meat.<br>+ roasted pig face: ordered this one because it was the most mentioned dish on Yelp review. Â Imagine bacon wrap in fat, deep fried and then roasted. It tasted like that. Â It's so fat, and there was nothing to balance it. It should have been served with some acidic salad/pickle on the side.<br>+ goat shank: last dish and the heaviest dish. Â I now have serious complaint about how G&TG does pricing and portion. It's supposed to be a tapas type of place, so why would you serve that much meat by itself, and priced it at $26? Also, the dishes here are served one by one, going from the lightest to the heaviest, so even if you order a salad to go with the goat shank, they would not be served together (if you didn't know and didn't ask). The portion and price was for an entry, not a small dish to share. Now the the dish itself, have you had roasted pork from chinatown? This dish probably used the same technique that resulted in extremely crispy skin. However, the meat lacked most, and was a pain to eat with Naan bread (which was actually really good). Â There was some nice sauce that came with it, but the dish itself was, again, just out of balance.<br><br>I may come back here just for the vegetable dishes.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Wil5Rl1jHNiqLadsxOhPRg/348s.jpg", "caption": "Kohlrabi salad"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BGuE5DL9W6WjiMC820xkIA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Sweet brioche - terrible!"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_vVTPV8FHx23b_UTKMnQYA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Pork shank"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "I was so excited to this place when I was planning for a trip to Chicago.

The wood oven roasted pig face, crisp braised pork shank, pan roasted halibut, oven roasted sepia, and galbi as main dishes; and wood grilled broccoli, and roasted cauliflower as veggie sides. We also ordered Best of Three, Local <br>75, Ring of Fire and Daiquiri for drinks.<br><br>The goat empanadas:<br>eh, it was okay. I couldn't really taste the goat meat in the empanada. The presentations were fantastic though. It came with strawberries topped with feta cheese!<br><br>The corn bread:<br>it was okay. Just very fluffy bread. Nothing special.<br><br>Wood oven roasted pig face: <br>I really like the two eggs on top of the meat. When you smash the eggs onto the meat, the creamy yolk mixed with the tender meat is very tasteful. <br><br>Crisp braised pork shank: <br>the pita bread that came with the dish was sooo good. Grab a chunk of meat, wrap it in a pita bread, put some sauces and kimchi on it and you are ready for some deliciousness.<br><br>Pan Roasted Halibut: <br>Yum!! This was my favorite dish! The halibut was served on a almond butter and covered with mushrooms and white asparagus, served on a bowl.

The tomato and avocado was added to enhance the chewiness and intensified the flavor.<br><br>Galbi: <br>It was served on top of 4 corns. As a Korean, I approve this galbi.

Perfectly fried and flaky exterior with delicious crab inside <br><br>Braised beef tongue - Beef tongue was cooked just right, tossed in a salad of sorts. <br><br>Wood oven roasted pig face - looked great, tasted a bit too fatty for me, but still good<br><br>Goat confit - also too heavy for my palate.

It was perfectly balanced with the whipped feta, crunchy chickpeas, nectarine slices and heirloom tomatoes on the side. A treat for vegetarians and carnivores alike!<br><br>Wood grilled broccoli - this was very different but I couldn't stop eating it! The smell was incredible! The crispies were my least favorite part of the dish - they appeared to be Rice Krispy cereal and didn't add much to the dish. <br><br>Pan fried shishito peppers - this was my least favorite of the dishes we ordered, but it was also probably because the first two peppers I picked were the hot ones. I didn't notice the miso taste at all, though the Parmesan and sesame seeds were caked on the outsides of the peppers.<br><br>Sweet potato pierogis - these were a little treat! Fluffy filling in a light dough with avocado creme and tasty accompaniments. Solid dish.<br><br>Peanut Butter and Jellywich - well, this was very interesting! We'd planned to stop somewhere else for dessert but after the dessert menu was dropped at the table, we were so intrigued that we gave it a whirl. Wow, was it zippy! The sponge cake and Concord grape sauce (that had almost a spicy, tingly aftertaste!) with crunchy peanut brittle, brown butter bread ice cream and torched peanut butter marshmallow. Yum!<br><br>Service by Owen was top-notch! As we'd both traveled in that day, we were exhausted and opted not to order alcohol. He never made us feel bad or cheap for choosing just to drink water. He also had a lot of enthusiasm, steered us in the right direction with some of the dishes and made small talk in between.

This is so filling that I don't know if you could down it quickly even if you tried, so we meticulously carved it up, despite the fact it easily falls right off the bone if you want it to.

Layer on honey sambal butter, and the richness coats your whole mouth. Add in the acidic kick of the relish, for a perfectly balanced, rich bite. Buttery, flakey, heaven.<br><br>Dish 2: escargot ravioli - bacon . tamarind-miso sauce<br>The escargot is tender, fork tender. You cut through the rotund middle of the ravioli easily, and ingest the savory pasta. Not a hint of rubber.<br><br>Dish 3: roasted cauliflower - pickled peppers . pine nuts . mint<br>This tasted like pad kee mao. The smartest application of Thai flavors I've ever seen. The cauliflower at the perfect doneness, sliced flat and fried with amazing mint and spice.<br><br>Dish 4: goat empanadas - huacatay . grilled mushroom giardiniera . queso fresco<br>The pickles were a bit overpowering, but perfect when combined with the flaky empanada shell. The goat meat - shredded inside, is moist and flavorful.<br><br>Dish 5: sautÃ©ed green beans - fish sauce vinaigrette . cashews<br>Addicting, said the waiter. Crisp tender green beans in a salty, creamy fish sauce.<br><br>Dish 6: seared diver scallops - ginger-chili aioli . shiitake . sea beans . braised peanuts<br>Plump, tender scallops. Carrying on the Thai/Vietnamese influence of garnishes of nuts with a peanut butter based sauce.<br><br>Dish 7: roasted duck breast - silver needle noodles . rapini .shrimp-duck jus<br>This was the only one that fell a little short of the others. Definitely good - just not much duck flavor and kind of bland. Definitely an opportunity to play on peking duck flavors, though no other dish has had expected flavor profiles.<br><br>Dish 8: wood oven roasted pig face - sunny side egg. tamarind. cilantro . red wine-maple. potato stix<br>Mix it all up and get essence of pork in a soft forkful. Not even sure what i was eating - the collagen melted like fat in your mouth - but charred and delicious.<br><br>Desserts: Because everything else was amazing.<br>miso-butterscotch budino<br>bacon toffee. glazed pineapple. candied cashews<br><br>plantain cake<br>cream cheese-chocolate chip gelato . passion fruit . left hand milk stout<br><br>Best $64 (incl. tax and tip) I've spent on a meal to date.

We walked in and were immediately greeted and shown to our table. The ambiance was very nice, dimly lit and cozy. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly, also was very helpful with suggestions.<br><br>We decided to split everything, as suggested. We started with cocktails and ordered the Ring of Fire. It was a delicious combination of strength and flavor. We continued to order these throughout our meal.<br><br>First food item were Raw Oysters. We decided on the Raw Kusshi at the suggestion of our waiter and they were great. One of my friends who is only a fan of raw oysters when they are covered with sauce and on a cracker did not even mind. There was so much flavor with these that nothing else was needed.<br><br>Second was the Calamari Bruschetta. This was an amazing dish that I barely got a picture of since we went to town on it as soon as it hit the table. The calamari was cooked to perfection with a nice balance of chewy and melt-in-your-mouth. The apples added a nice touch of flavor and the bread was delicious.<br><br>Third we had the Escargot Ravioli in bacon broth. This was also a killer dish that was devoured quickly. The bacon broth really made the dish and incorporated so much flavor and the crispy onions on top were delicious.<br><br>Fourth we had the Sauteed Green Beans. These were delicious but probably my least favorite dish. Don't get me wrong this was fantastic, every other item was just amazing that this had to be picked last. The sauce and onions were great on top and definitely not too overwhelming.<br><br>Fifth we devoured the Goat Empanadas. There is not much I can say about these other than you absolutely have to try this dish. <br><br>Last for our main course was the ever popular Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face. This might sound a little weird but you do not get the actual face of a pig on your plate, it is shredded. This was the perfect way to end the main courses of a perfect meal. <br><br>Finally to round out our whole dinner we had to have dessert. We ordered the PB&J dessert, again at the suggestion of our waiter. It was absolutely delicious and the pieces of peanut brittle were an amazing addition.<br><br>This was an absolutely amazing restaurant and I would recommend to any of my friends traveling to the Chicago area.

Our group shared the soft blue crab cake which Waze flavorful and a good basic start to the meal. The second dish was Escargot ravioli. It sounds weird at first but really it tasted like chopped mussels in fresh ravioli. I've had large escargot before and this tasted nothing like that. Our next course was the duck tongue. It was a similar to a delicate small piece of pork belly but with a little more flavor. Then came the actual pork belly which was a little tough and thin than I'm used too but that mishap was forgiven quickly when the server brought out the pigs head. Whether or not it actually was the head of a pig; it had a fantastic flavor and we were back in course. We closed our meal with wood fired lamb ribs.

Everything that was served was absolutely delicious! I came here last night for a Team dinner and we had our own private room downstairs. The exterior is lovely with an outdoor dining area and the room where we dined was lovely and rustic. Beautiful setting on a wood table with candles and a plant in the center. <br><br>We met Gary, our go to server for the evening and he was awesome... Really knew the menu well, listened and tended to our dietary needs, and was completely gracious throughout the night. <br><br>I asked if any of the amazing-sounding cocktails could be made without alcohol and so I got The Royal Rubus that way. It was citrusy soda with lemon bitters, blackberry and lime. It came in a brilliant raspberry red and was very tasty and refreshing. <br><br>Started off with an assortment of breads: One sourdough with little pieces of ham in it, which was okay. I didn't have a ton of flavor but I liked the green peas and ham that came with it. There was also muffin top bread, which was nicely moist and it came with yummy seasoned butter. <br><br>Next we had \"Fried Naked Cowboys\" which were fried oysters with egg salad on the bottom. These came in cute little spoons and one bite form. Even though I'm not a huge fan of oysters, it was quite good fried and the sauce on top worked well with it. <br><br>Then there was salad which consisted of fennel, evalon cheese, toasted almonds and blueberries. This was nice and I especially liked the cheese, which was a sweet goat cheese with fruity and nutty finish. It added an additional layer of delightful flavor to the salad. <br><br>The goat empanadas were one of my favorite dishes. It had strawberry, white asparagus with it and smashed avocado underneath. The empanadas were perfectly crispy and the goat meat was so very flavorful and melted in my mouth! <br><br>We also had green garlic pierogis which was decent, but I didn't taste a strong garlic taste. The filling was like mashed potatoes. <br><br>The vegetables we had were cauliflower, broccoli and string beans. The cauliflower dish had pickled peppers, pine nuts and parmesan cheese. It was slightly crispy and had a nice burst of flavor. The broccoli had little crisps and the green beans had yummy cashews! <br><br>The entrees were pasta, fish and pork shank. The pasta was spiral with tons of appetizing beef, which was wonderfully juicy and incredibly savory. There were also little orange tomatoes and tomatoes on top that were fresh and flavorful. We also had wild striped bass in a coconut green curry, new potatoes and artichokes. I enjoyed this dish, especially the slightly charred skin on the fish. Last, was the crisp braised pork shank with naan and the following dipping sauces: Grilled spring onion kimchi and buttermilk dressing. The pork was so wonderful and tender! Â I loved the crunchiness of it. <br><br>After all that, there were 5 different types of desserts. My absolute favorite was vanilla gelato with chocolate shell, caramel sauce and caramel popcorn. This dessert was truly delectable and so decadent. I could have a whole bowl of it if I wasn't already so stuffed. My second favorite dessert was balls of coated gelato with peanut butter inside and candied peanuts. There was also a tres leches cake with strawberry and some pudding, as well as fruity sorbet. It was a nice, light and yummy treat. Then there was a pudding-like dessert with a blend of pure toffee pieces, expresso and vanilla. The last dessert was different and interesting. It consisted of gelatin, blueberries and pieces of meringue. <br><br>Each dish from appetizer, to entree, to dessert was well thought out and unique in a good way. All of the food exceeded my expectations and was mouthwateringly delicious! The service was impeccable. Everything came together seamlessly.

Â They have a main menu as well as a changing, seasonal menu with oysters, goat products, and some choice breads. Â <br><br>The meals ordered consisted of the bruschetta calamari, goat empanadas, roasted cauliflower, and pork shank. Â The brushetta came in more of a bowl than your typical plated bruschetta. Â The calamari was fresh and not breaded, more in the grilled octopus variety. Â Really fresh and accompanied with a nice sauce. Â The empanadas had some shredded goat filling and a sweet sauce. Â The dish came with Â 2 empanadas but both were quite large. Â Throw in a very unique, fresh mushroom on the plate, and I'm hooked. Â Next, the cauliflower were a very good side to any meal. Â Light and earthy, yet a weird flavor with mint and pepper combination. Â Very weird combination in this plate but it worked. Â Finally, the true winner of the day, the pork shank. Â This was ordered by everyone it seemed. Â Huge bone on pork that just fell off the bone. Â The skin had a peking duck crispiness while the pork was a fantastic carnita style meat. Â The dish came with very interesting sides as the kimchi sweet potato and buffalo sauce gave the dish flair and a refreshing taste when all combined. Â The bread on the side - too good. Â Pita wrap which is too good when combined with the pork. Â This dish had so many components and opportunities to make side dishes besides the main pork on its own that it just blows you away - must order.<br><br>Pro tip is to make a reservation at least a week or more out. Â The bar and lounge area is open seating but during the dinner hours an hour wait for a seat is modest. Â But they do have full service and 80% of the seats are filled with eaters rather than strictly drinkers. Â <br><br>My meal was a veggie, 2 large appetizers and a main.

Overall, I would rate my total meal experience a 9, and my total experience an 11.<br><br>To start, G&TG had some of the best service I have ever encountered at any restaurant. The servers are extremely attentive. There was never a time that my glass was empty, or that my server was gone too long. Its these kinds of details that make you want to be a regular at any restaurant.<br><br>The Goat Empanadas: While I was nervous about trying goat, my nerves were instantly diminished by the incredibly balanced and satisfying flavors that were exploding out of this empanada. This crispness of the empanada was truly beautiful. With each bite, I was left with a smoky aftertaste that was mind-blowing. And I honestly could not get enough of the light mayo dressing (i think thats what it was) that was drizzled on top. 9.4 score overall. <br><br>The Calamari Bruschetta: This was extremely disappointing. The calamari itself was cooked perfectly, but the bruschetta as a whole lacked flavor.The bruschetta was topped with a creamy cheese layer that was light and sat between the bread and the calamari. Over the calamari, were apple shavings that gave nice bursts of flavor. This dish was not bad, but compared to everything else that was unbelievable, this did not hold up. 5.5 overall score.<br><br>The Pork Shank: I actually have tears in my eyes thinking about this dish. I miss it. The meat is so creamy and cooked so perfectly, that it truly falls off of the bone. It is accompanied by 2 sauces. One, the red sauce, is a lightly spicy sauce that i practically bathed my meat it to. I would have poured the remaining sauce in my mouth honestly if I wasn't on a date. the second, a buttermilk ranch, was good but too creamy for my personal tastes. A carrot salad also is on the plate, and that too is perfectly light and balanced. I would eat that any day. 9.8 overall score. <br><br>The Pig Face: WOW! First off, don't let the name scare you. To think the my boyfriend and I hesitated ordering this offends me looking back. It was by far one of the more amazing dishes that has ever graced my mouth. The meat has a over easy egg on top, and both practically melt open with the touch of your fork. The egg was the perfect compliment, and i even licked the plate for more when it was over. ( I have no regrets about that) <br><br>Finally the Carmel desert, the restaurant (again being so amazingly attentive) knew it was an anniversary and brought us out a caramel popcorn ice-cream dessert.

The slight cooking probably brings out a stronger taste in the oysters and it was soooo delicious. The oysters were fresh, succulent and creamy and one of the best things I ate that night. Definitely ties for 1st place with the pork face as most memorable dish. MUST GET THEM! <br><br>-porkface- I loved it. Don't recall trying pork face before but the meat has a nice texture and it's also fatty so it was tastyyyy....kinda like porkbelly, but slightly different. I definitely recommend trying this dish if you wanna try something different/slightly exotic yet tasty.<br><br>-bucatini- yummy! Mixed with milk braised pork shoulder and tomatoes. It tasted somewhat like penne vodka, but it's bucatini. I've never had bucatini before and found it interesting that the middle of the noodle is hollow. Everytime I slurp up the pasta I can hear it because of the air going through the bucatini. This is probably my 3rd favorite dish that night.<br><br>-Hamachi Crudo- it was good but not amazing or unforgettable. There's probably better things on the menu I could've tried.<br><br>-goat empanadas- I didn't originally want to get this but since I was at \"girl and the GOAT\", I figured I needed to try some goat, and alot of yelpers seemed to like this dish. It tasted good and had interesting flavors with the avocado and the strawberries. The goat meat in the empanadas reminded me of pulled pork but with a more gamey taste, but not as strong as lamb. If you wanna try something goat, I'd probably try a different dish. This one was good but wasn't particularly memorable to me. I wish I ordered my original first choice of the grilled octopus instead. I guess this gives me a reason to go back to chicago.<br><br>For dessert, the waiter recommended the caramel popcorn with ice cream.dont remember the official name on the menu but it was good. The caramel popcorn went well with the ice cream.<br><br>Waiters were nice and attentive.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lXlIcTqr8wWi1MwALN51vA/348s.jpg", "caption": "Caramel popcorn ice cream"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VVXSdz4KwNdMdHrQbk7bHg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Wood grilled pork face- MUST get this!"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ChQjjOZPYZhXrJgloZs7mQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Bucatini- YUM"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Several friends recommended I dine here while in Chicago, so I came with two friends on a Sunday evening. We came shortly after 6PM and the wait was already over two hours, but fortunately, we were also given the option of sitting outdoors, for which there was immediate availability. We got lucky, because one of my friends had to go in for her night shift at 9PM, so we wouldn't have been able to wait two hours.<br><br>Though I didn't sit inside, I did get a peek of the interior, and it's quite a large space, with lots of tables and a lounging area with couches. I also went to use the restroom, which was downstairs. I will say that the light at the stairwell is not very bright and I had difficulty seeing the steps, so I feel like this could be improved for safety considerations. I also found it amusing that the restrooms below are individual rooms (probably at least six separate doors) with no gender designation; I've never seen that before!<br><br>Our waitress was great. She wasn't overtly friendly, but was very attentive. Our dishes were served by many different people, but each time, they always announced the name of the dish and the primary ingredients, which I think added a nice touch of class. Our waters were also regularly topped off.<br><br>Since we were a party of three, it was recommended that we order six plates for sharing, so that's exactly what we did (plus one dessert). I can't remember all the names of the dishes now, but see my photos and their corresponding captions. There is a separate menu of \"goat dishes,\" and the goat liver mousse that we opted for was fantastic! It came with lots of warm biscuits and several sauces/garnishes. All of our other dishes were amazing too. <br><br>The presentation of each dish was also very thoughtful. The quality of the ingredients was apparent when you tasted each dish, and while the portions were not large, the three of us were still full at the end of the meal.<br><br>Although pricey, our meal after splitting three-ways was only about $40 per person, which was reasonable.

The tongues were crispy and I could have eaten them without anything else. The pig face was the favorite of the table with porky goodness mixed with unctuous egg yolk. <br><br>The pierogis were ok but at $16 for the dish definitely not worth it as the fried dough tasted more like an empanada filled with cheese with not much ramp flavor. <br><br>The octopus was tender and had a lovely grilled flavor but I felt the sauce might have been a little heavy handed and masked the dish a bit. The worst dish was the ham frites which our waiter vaguely warned us about by saying they were fries basically. My husband still went ahead though. The fries themselves were very good but there was a dusting of ham salt as it was explained to us that tasted like ground up bacon bits.

It was so tender and flavorful. The menu said it was served with a \"salsa verde,\" but I thought it was more similar to a pesto. Either way, it was still great. The cuttle fish was amazing! It had great flavor. The fish was mostly potatoes with a few pieces of cuttle fish, but I loved the combo of the pistachio and Dijon. So delicious! The goat belly was served with bits of lobster. I actually really liked the goat belly itself. It was tender, but I was pretty underwhelmed by the fish itself. Our waitress said their green beans were really popular, so we decided to give them a try. I was really not a fan. The fish sauce was overpowering and way too salty. I told the waitress I wasn't a fan, and they brought us the broccoli! It was such a nice gesture, but we were unimpressed by the dish :/. <br><br>Service: the service was outstanding!! Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and very accommodating. We also really appreciated them bringing out another veggie dish after I made a comment about not loving the green beans. <br><br>Ambience: it's a big space, but still very cozy.

The sauce was delicious and craftfully served. <br><br>- Crispy Braised Short Ribs<br>My pick for the best dish we ate! It was perfectly tangy and sweet. The meat was cooked just right and the sauce paired well with it. Don't tell anyone but I drank the sauce off the bowl!

It was served with a mignonette sauce, and the oysters themselves were tiny but packed with flavor!! <br><br>Goat carpaccio - got to order goat here, right? Thinly sliced raw goat served with thin fried parsnips, vinaigrette, and frise. Very nice. <br><br>Duck tongue - We ordered this last minute actually, and this actually ended up being my favorite dish of the night (over the pig face). Don't let the protein freak you out -- it was a piece of deliciously fried and well seasoned duck tongue (it just tastes like regular duck and isn't really any textual differences). Try this!! <br><br>Pig face - Overrated. A runny egg covers a compressed patty of pig face parts with some potato sticks. I didn't think this was particularly interesting. Just a standard old-fashioned egg and meaty goodness. It's basically like pork belly. <br><br>Pork shank - This was a peculiar dish. It was good but not sure what the vision was. It was a beautifully fried pork shank served with homemade naan (done really well), buttermilk ranch, hot sauce, and kimchi. It wasn't really conducive to being eaten together (naan was cut in small pita-like triangles and didn't open, so not much to stuff?) <br><br>Chili crab - I think this is supposed to be Singapore chili crab inspired, but I didn't get any heat at all. It was a fairly sour sauce, and the crab rice just tasted insanely sour and tart. When mixed with the strawberries, rice, and soft shell crab, it was okay. <br><br>All the leches - Wonderful end to the meal. Two small pieces of tres leches cake served with a rhubarb sorbet.

A lot of the the selection here focuses on parts of pork, goat, or other meats that the adventurous eaters would find \"bold\" and \"edgy.\" I just find it an upscale, tapas style of what I've enjoyed growing up.<br><br>The menu was split between six different sections, which our waitress gladly explained upon being seated. Between the three of us, we ordered four items: Kusshi Oysters ($12), Confit Goat ($19), Baby Octopus ($16), and finally the ever elusive Pig Face ($19).<br><br>The oysters came in four and definitely packed a punch. Be careful to not swallow too much of the tangy sauce at the bottom of the shell. I definitely enjoyed these bad boys. Afterwards, our Pig Face came in- tender pork bits laid over by a sunny side egg. The meat was impeccable, full of flavor, and absolutely delicious. Our order of baby octopus came next and was also very nice, although I prefer mine to be a bit more on the chargrilled side. Lastly, the confit goat came after we had finished the first three, and the bourbon extract made this taste like dessert!

Â This was fully expected as the restaurant is well known to be amazing. Â We got a drink at place down the road until our table was ready and were very surprised to see that at nearly 11:10 when we sat down, the place was still packed. Â Great sign seeing as how they \"close\" at 11pm.<br><br>Our server was extremely courteous and very friendly taking the time to explain the restaurant to us and the menu. Â She flagged a few of their specials, told us that for the 5 of us we probably need 10 dishes and left us to look over the menu. Â We picked 10 items and 1 bread and eagerly awaited our dishes. Â I'm going to list below the dishes with what I thought, but for the sake of length, I'll give the gist of the review here. Â The ambiance was modern and romantic, the service was excellent, the food outstanding. Â The only minor complaint i'd have is value. Â I realize this place is very famous and on waits until deep into closing time even on weekends, but the price per dish felt high, compared to other tapas places around town that are just as delicious. Â I would come back here in a heart beat. Â Highly recommend for date night.<br><br>**Below is a list of dishes in (roughly) the order we received them.**<br><br>Olive You - This was amazing, olive loaf with whipped feta. Â Highly recommend<br><br>Corn Bread - We got this because one of our party has alergy to gluten. Â This was a hit at the table, but personally I much preferred the olive loaf.<br><br>Hamachi Crudo - Hands down, the least favorite at the table. Â The cripsy pork belly that was served with it as a flavor enhancer was x10 better than the actual dish. Â Would not recommend this.<br><br>Goat Empanadas - This dish was beyond phenomenal. Â It was hard for me to decide on 2nd place for me, but this was tied with the Pork Shank Â (below)<br><br>Pork Shoulder Buccatini Â - My shining star....the most amazing, most delicious and most flavorful dish I've had in a very long time. Â I cannot say enough good things about this dish. Â My #1 by a very long shot. Â I would come back here for just this dish.<br><br>Roasted Cauliflower - Exactly what you'd expect in my opinion, but with mint. Â Roasted and sprinkled with pine nuts and then cooked with mint. Â This was simply OK by my standards, but 2 people at our table loved it.<br><br>Chickpea Fritter - Â Very tasty, but I could honestly take it or leave it next time. Â It definitely hard a lot of flavors in layers, so I recommend trying it, but don't expect to be blown away.<br><br>Pan Roasted Halibut - This dish was very good. Â 3 out of 5 from our table labeled this as their #1 dish of the night. Â Personally I thought it was cooked very well, but the real standout for this dish was the sauce it was in...a butter of some sort which I later found out was made with marcona almonds. Â I think you could put that sauce on a brick and it would have made it awesome.<br><br>Grilled Baby Octopus - Unfortunately I'm not a big octopus fan, so I did not try this. Â Don't sue!<br><br>Crisp Pork Shank - Tied for my second favorite with the Goat Empanadas. Â This was phenomenal. Â They serve it with naan, kimchee and this tangerine sauce. Â Combine those together and you have fantastic flavor.<br><br>Roasted Pig Face - Alright, first of all...I ordered this because people told me \"oh, you have to try it!\" and I figured, hey....when in Rome. Â Honestly...even without knowing what I was eating...I wasn't a huge fan. Â Simply, it just didn't taste great.

This was the restaurant we most wanted to visit on our trip to Chicago (big Top Chef/Stephanie fans) and we definitely weren't disappointed. We enjoyed everything we ate (well, almost everything) and would come back. <br><br>But there was nothing about my meal here that had an addictive property; nothing really resonated with me deeply. There was great depth of flavor in every dish, and the flavor combinations were very tasty. I'd definitely want to come back and try other items, maybe I just didn't order the right thing for me.<br><br>What I liked:<br>+ Pretzel bread with honey mustard/thousand island. Lots of horse radish in the sauces. Very tasty and best when eaten with both sauces together.<br>+ Scallop. Perfectly cooked and seared, great notes of sweetness and tasty sauce.<br>+ Pierogi. Delicious, but had no sweet potato flavor. You could see the orange of the sweet potato, but we didn't taste it at all. Blue cheese overpowered it, I guess. Very good regardless.<br>+ Grilled octopus. This was definitely my favorite dish! My gf could taste the lemon, but I wanted even MORE acid. Octopus was cooked so nicely, with great grilled flavor. This is probably the one thing I would reorder if I came back.<br>+ Cheesecake. Great notes of flavor in this cheesecake, almost burntish. A great finish to the meal.<br><br>Average/not great:<br>- Chickpea fritter. A favorite for most, and my gf seemed to like this one a lot, but it was unmemorable/average for me.<br>- Goat liver mousse. Our least favorite dish, we could barely eat any of it. The crumpets were fluffy and moist, but \"goat\" and \"liver\" just aren't two words that go together for me. Pickled vegetables were nice but didn't lighten up that goaty flavor. This was just a bad order decision on our part.<br>- Blood orange green tea. I mean... it's just tea.<br><br>A solid meal that lived up to the hype for us. Worth repeating to try everything on the menu, and definitely worth a try if you've never been.

However it works out tonight as we cleared out one by one quickly... <br><br>Please keep in mind that all 4 of us have the Asian taste buds so this could be a bit biased. Here we go:<br><br>Must have: Pig face- the famous pig face was a very good explaination of Girl and the Goat food-surprising and delicious combination of flavors and textures. The pig face was roasted to very tender mixing with running yolk, potato stick and cilantro sauce to bring the fun combination in the month with soft tasted meat (or fat) and crisp potato sticks. I love it. This dish should be very good for your skin per my mom which is a bonus<br><br>Duck tongue was fried duck tongue with Tuna Poke, crispy wontons and some (pickled or processed) black beans. Again those mixed flavors and textures gave me a different way to think how the stuff should be cooked and put in a dish together. I never thought Tuna Poke would go so well with duck tongue. I came from a city in China which is famous for salted duck and a whole variety of duck dishes. Duck tongue is also a local delicate. This dish was be praised by my folks at the table which means it was awesome.<br><br>Roasted drum fish was Spicy! Not only with the hot peppers and lots of peppercorns. It was roasted perfectly with the brownish crust on the top layer. It looked harmless with the apples slices, sesame seeds and green veggies on the top. Remember to get the yogurt on the buttom. I had a bit cough so didn't get a lot. Have to eat it again. BTW, Halibut was not available due to the season.<br><br>Nice to have : Bread is not free. For $5 per serving, we all liked Miso bread. Olive you was good too.<br>Wood fired oyster was pretty good. Others were thinking those were too fishy. I liked it. <br>Roasted cauliflower were great too with pickled peppers and pine nuts. I love the roasted and crunchy veggies so this is my dish. I guess my mom didn't like the cheese or peppers. <br><br>Might pass next time: Escargot dumplings was good. Maybe I was used to the French style buttery escargot. So when the escarole came out the wraper without any extra flavor or sauce, I was a bit disppointed.

And I loved how interesting / creative all the food was - everything has a twist of some sort, and yet the food didn't feel too \"fussed over.\"<br><br>We tried:<br><br>Kohlrabi salad (fennel, evalon, toasted almonds, roasted shiitake, apples) - Simple, flavorful and yummy. Came tossed with a white dressing, which I'm usually not a fan of, but this was light and not overwhelming and really complemented the flavors of the salad.<br><br>Goat carpaccio (smoked trout roe, olive-maple vinaigrette) - Sharp acid / vinegar flavor that honestly made it impossible for me to tell that I was eating goat. Smoked trout roe was a nice touch, adding a pop of brininess to the vinegar flavors. <br><br>Roasted cauliflower (pickled peppers, pine nuts, mint) - A favorite of the night. Sounds so simple but was so yummy. The pickled peppers really added a unique flavor dimension to this dish that worked super well. <br><br>Seared diver scallops (toasted miso-brown butter aioli, blood orange, smoked beet, pistachio) - My favorite dish of the night! Perfectly seared scallops and the blood orange was a surprise pairing that I had never had with scallops before and that once again just worked. <br><br>Escargot ravioli (bacon tamarind sauce, escarole & celery, crispy onions) - Sounds very interesting in concept, but in execution, I felt like I could barely taste the escargot wrapped inside, and instead was mostly just eating the pasta wrapper. <br><br>Wood oven roasted pig face (sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine-maple, potato stix) - Don't worry this is not a whole pig's head - more like pulled pork meat mixed with egg. Was told I HAD to get this, but honestly might have been my least favorite dish of the night. It was fine, but too heavy, and not really to my tastes. <br><br>Sticky tasty crunchy toffee yummy cake (sweet potato cake . toffee sauce & crunch . brown butterscotch ice cream . gooseberry) - Even dessert was a hit! The sweet potato cake was moist and delicious and the ice scream was pretty awesome - very distinctly salted, but once again it worked, and it was quickly devoured by my dining companions (though tbh I'm not a fan of butterscotch and found the ice cream a too sweet). <br><br>Also want to give a shout out to the service - possibly some of the best service I've ever encountered.

Â This restaurant was highly recommended by a lot of my friends. Â I was not family with Chef Izard (from Top Chef) so I wasn't aware of the hype. Â I made reservations approximately 1 month in advance for a party of 2 and got a slot at 6:45pm on Friday. Â We got there and the place was packed.<br>Ambiance: Â Typical hip/trendy restaurant. Â Place was packed. Â Volume was moderate but able to hold a conversation. Â Tables are pretty close to each other. Â Made it difficult to not check out what they other people were all eating. Â There were a couple big tables that I saw that could accommodate up to 8 people. Â Love the open kitchen. Â Bar area was packed as well. Â I think you don't need reservation for that area. Â <br>Service: Â Fantastic. Â We were approached right away by our server. Â He was pretty thorough in his explanation. Â He requested that we ordered everything up front and he would organize how to bring it out. Â Since the food portion was smaller, it was nice not to have all the things come out at once. Â The pace of service was really good. Â Dishes were cleared right away and water was refilled in a timely fashion. Â A+ for service<br>Food: Â Difficult to explain the flavor. Â Most of the dishes were really complexed and had a lot of ingredients, but when eaten together worked...Between the 2 of us, we polished off 6 dishes +dessert. Â We started off with the Shishito peppers. Â They were covered with parmesan cheese and tasted amazing. Â None of them were spicy at all. Â Best prep of the peppers I have ever had. Â Next the Hamachi Crudo...not your typical crudo as it was paired with crispy pork belly. Â So it didn't have the clean flavor that I expected but was finished with a pretty salty component. Â Eaten separately, they tasted weird, but when eaten together was pretty darn good. Â We had some baked oysters (also had bacon on top) that were pretty good. Â My favorite dish was the calamari bruschetta. Â The calamari was not fried (as I would expected) but was cooked in a butter of sorts. Â They you have the bruschetta with goat ricotta and goat bacon and the green apple...when eaten together was one of the most amazing bites I have had. Â The saltiness, creaminess, and sweetness all blended together. Â So good. Â We then had the lamb ribs...I have never had lamb prepared like a bbq pork rib before. Â There were 4 pieces of the most tender ribs I have had. Â Covered with a blueberry bbq sauce (sweeter side). Â Definition of finger licking good! Â Finally we had the goat belly confit. Â This was served with fennel, crab, lobster, and a bunch of other things. Â Meat was super tender. Â Flavor was good, but I thought it had a tad too many components. Â With both the goat and lamb, neither tasted gamey at all.<br><br>All in all, an amazing dining experience. Â I would highly recommend for all to try.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Wow!

For instance, I wanted to get a small sample of a glass and she mentioned that the bartender usually doesn't do this (which is odd bc at other restaurants, it's usually not a big deal - even at Duck Duck Goat, they asked us if we wanted to try a sample since we were debating between 2 sparkling wines) Then the waitress asked are you guys going to share 1 glass? I felt a bit offended and thought maybe she thought since we just ate, we wouldn't be ordering a lot of food or drinks... but we ordered more than enough food and drinks. Also, we saw the interaction with the customers next to us and felt we weren't getting any love, which really ruined the entire experience for us.<br><br>Onto the food:<br>Caramel popcorn and vanilla gelato: 5/5 this was amazing!!!

Â It probably was over the top to have the 2 desserts but we left quite full and incredibly satisfied.<br><br>The roasted cauliflower had that nice touch of charring that provides a sweeter and nuttier flavour to the vegetable. Â It was balanced by the pine nuts, touch of mint, and peppers. Â I really enjoyed this dish.<br><br>The grilled baby octopus came next and my partner was terrified of the tentacles. Â I ate the first one and I knew it was a winner... tender with a bright citrus note from the sauce and also a savoury note from the guanciale, this was a great dish.

Â Yes but the all the leches dessert was so worthy of ordering every time. Â It's the perfect summery light but bold berry flavour dessert. Â It was inhaled by my partner who normally doesnt eat dessert. Â I enjoyed the caramel in 3 incarnations in the caramel corn & malt ball dessert ... thick gooey caramel sauce on the bottom, chewy and butter caramel pieces, and caramelized crunchy pieces in the caramel corn.

I can only assume that these creations are unique to this fascinating restaurant. The atmosphere was quaint and intimate. <br><br>Our first plate to arrive was the \"It's gouda\" bread with smoked lard butter and romesco. The bread was a rustic loaf that had a crusty and chewy quality with a hint of gouda baked into it. The real star of this plate was the lard butter and romesco. The smoked lard butter had a delightfully cream texture to it which melded well with the sweet and salty smokiness of the romesco. I easily could have made a meal of just this dish and wish I could buy the lard butter for everyday use.<br><br>Following the bread were the chickpea fritters, which were garnished with whipped spiced yogurt, sorrel chutney, and a mango-citrus relish. The fritters had a nice crispy golden brown crust with a velvety filling. The mago-citrus relish had a slight bite to it that added depth to the fritter which, in turn, was expanded by the whipped spiced yogurt. I can't say for sure if the yogurt had a prevalent lemon flavor or if it was the mingling of the relish with the yogurt on the plate that gave it this quality but the combination was delightful.<br><br>Accompanying the fritters were the duck tongues with tuna and black bean poke, crispy wontons, and piri piri. At first, this dish seemed slightly intimidating to our group unsure of what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised when it arrived at the table. The dish had an east Asian inspired taste to it. The texture of the duck tongues were evocative of crispy pork cracklings with a slight give to it. This ended up being one of the favorites and I recommend giving it a try.<br><br>After the duck tongues were the goat empanadas topped with miso-blue cheese aioli and squash-apple slaw. The savory roasted goat was enjoyably different and wrapped in a perfectly crispy pastry crust that wasn't at all flaky and then cooked to golden perfection giving it a wonderful aroma. The miso-blue cheese aioli gave the dish a twang which was then softened by its creaminess and balanced by the sweetness from the squash-apple slaw. I only wish I could have had more of these fantastic little treats. <br><br>Both the red fish and the catfish came to the table at the same time. The red fish was accompanied by Manilla clams in a curry apple broth topped with an herb salad. The dish was very reminiscent of a Thai curry soup. The broth had a very fragrant flavor with a coconut undertone which paired well with the fish which had only a slight flake to it reminding you that it was fish.<br><br>The blackened catfish was served on a bed of dirty rice then topped with goat xo and pickled persimmons. This was my favorite plate of the evening. The flavors were well developed to a point that they would change in waves of bold flavors: first a slight sweetness, then a hint of bitter vinegar and spice, followed by a salty savory that rounded everything off in to a pleasant luxury.<br><br>After the fish, we received the roasted cauliflower with pickled peppers, pine nuts, and mint. I am always amazed by the versatility of cauliflower, it simply seems to go with everything and can transform a dish or stand out on its own. The fact that this dish was delicious came as no surprise especially with the tartness of the pickled peppers. The texture, however, was a truly delightful addition. The cauliflower was roasted to a state of tenderness, the peppers had a slight crunch, and the pine nuts, a slightly bigger crunch, were wonderful little nuggets of treasure scattered throughout the dish.<br><br>Another dish, which was mildly intimidating was the wood oven roasted pig face topped with a sunny side up egg, drizzled with tamarind, cilantro, and red wine-maple, accompanied by potato stix. It is my understanding that this is one of their most popular dishes on the menu. A perfectly cooked egg blanketed the dish to hide the decadent prize that lie beneath a crispy nest like pile of potato stix. The pig face was juicy, fatty, with some bites having a texture that I can only compare to smooth pÃ¢tÃ© or pork mousse.<br><br>Our final plate of the evening was the confit goat belly in a bourbon butter with lobster and crab and fennel. This dish is the very epitome of decadence. Words elude me when trying to describe the transcendent nature of this dish. The savory goat belly is featured in this dish in the form of a compacted molding of shredded meat with a crispy exterior topped by just enough crab and lobster to avoid stealing the focus from the dish's namesake. The entire dish is then drizzled in the richest bourbon butter sauce possibly conceived. <br><br>The entire meal was decadent and seemingly hedonistic, appealing to all my senses in such a way that it triggered unequivocal elation noticeable to my dining companions. Our bill, consisting of 8 individual dishes, 2 drinks, and coffee and tea for each of us came to $202. With a well earned tip, it came to $65 each.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Probably the most fun I've had dining out, with exceptional food as well.

The best dishes were a goat liver mousse with some magical homemade crumpets and bits of pickled vegetables and rhubarb, and a set of pierogis filled with spring onion. These were flavorful, made excellent use of summer vegetables and pickling, and generally highly recommended. (Honorable mention goes to my tiki-ish cocktail, the \"Mahalo,\" which was not oversweet, in case you were worried about that, as I was.)<br><br>The other dishes, though a little less exciting, were still uniformly very good, sometimes interesting, always hearty and well-seasoned. This is the kind of place you could always take out of town guests and leave them very impressed with what a tasty and fun city Chicago is. (If you could get a reservation, of course, which you probably can't.)<br><br>Still and all, on the food alone, I can't rate this place five stars -- not in a city where it competes with Parachute and Topolobampo and Dove's Luncheonette, not on a *block* where it competes with Au Cheval and Lena Brava. The food at the Girl and the Goat is really good, but it is four stars when graded on the Chicago curve, because the Chicago restaurant scene is an embarrassment of riches.<br><br>And that brings us to the service. Each individual issue may seem minor, but they added up to an atmosphere of inhospitality: 1, They were more than fifteen minutes late in seating us for our reservation (ironic, given how hard the reservations are to get in the first place). 2, There's no place in the entryway to sit while you are kept waiting fifteen minutes for your table -- a minor inconvenience most of the time, a little less minor if one of the two of you is eight months pregnant. (We did eventually snag a stool-like pillow thing in the bar area, but seating was hard to find there too, because of course it is really serving as a second dining room.) 3, Once we did get to the table, we were noticeably, and unpleasantly, rushed. One set of appetizers piled out on top of the others. One entree rushed out, while we were only starting to nibble on the previous one, with an added injunction to eat the new one right away lest it get soggy. Our server then tried to stick us with a dessert menu while both these entrees were still only half-eaten. (We clocked it at less than 55 minutes into our seating that the dessert menu arrived.)<br><br>Now most of this wasn't our server's fault. When we told him to stop rushing us, he did ease off, and did so without being disgruntled or abandoning us entirely, and he twice interjected some helpful pieces of advice into our menu selection. Rather, all of these things seem more like structural issues -- cramming in too many reservations and too many diners, and thus creating pressure to both keep people waiting and flip their tables faster. Given the long-lasting hype for this place, I can understand how things got this way, but the experience lowered a four-star experience to half that.<br><br>I'm glad I can cross it off my list, but a little bit of that is because now I don't have to go back.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Tasty menu and good sized portions.

So many people say the cauliflower is amazingggg, but we thought it was just good. Nothing really stood out from it. The chickpeas was one of my favorite. It's deep fried, and then is wrapped in some yogurt to add moisture, and to add more flavor they sprinkle some mango slices and chutney. Really good. The pig face isn't intimidating since it's not really an entire face, and probably just cheeks. It is quite fatty and crispy, pretty tasty and unique. The goat liver mousse....if you like that kind of spread, you will love this. They give you more than a fair share of spread. The bread that comes with it is amazingggg, think biscuit flavor, but puffier and not as flakey. For those that don't like the liver flavor, they provide additionally sweeter spreads to help lower that flavor. Lastly, the pork shank.

We were lucky enough to sit at the Chef's table and let me tell you, what a fantastic dining experience this was. Not only were we able to eat the delicious food, we also were able to see it being made. And as if working in a busy kitchen was not enough, the chefs still made a point to interact with us and answer any questions we had. If you ever have the opportunity to seat at the chef's table, you SHOULD DO IT!<br><br>Here is what we had (sorry for the long list, we a lot J):<br><br>- Â  Pan fried shishito pepper (although I am not a fan of shishito pepper, I have to say that these had great flavors and the dish was pretty big, definitely a plate to share, in my opinion).<br>- Â  Wood grilled broccoli (MY FAVORITE DISH! The broccoli was made to perfection and even had spiced rice crispies. At first when I read that on the menu was not really feeling it but when I tasted it, it was sooo good!)<br>- Â  Green garlic pierogies (MY SECOND FAVORITE DISH! The smoked tomato-rhubarb relish made the dish for me, as I am used to regular pierogies and this was a nice turn on this dish)<br>- Â  Escargot ravioli (although I am french, I do not mess with escargots....at all, however, I wish I did because this dish smelled SO good. My boyfriend totally loved them. If I did not know that there were escargots in them, I probably would have eaten them...I did sneak away a little crispy onion!!)<br>- Â  Braised beef tongue (yea, totally did not even look at that one... but, per my boyfriend, it was cooked to perfection and the salsa verde was a great pairing)<br>- Â  Sweet onion brioche (this was my least favorite dish, in all honesty. It was good but nothing breathtaking. I thought the smoke salmon cream cheese lacked the smoke salmon flavor and the brioche bread was a bit dry, to my taste)<br>- Â  Lemon make you happy dessert (this was delicious! I absolutely LOVE lemon pound cake and this was a hit! The almond crunch that came with it create the perfect flavor mixture and the cheesecake sauce was yummy too. The sorrel ice cream was okay to me. I would probably need to try it again as this was a flavor I was not expecting)<br>- Â  Chocolate pavlova says-a-me (I was not into this dessert at all because I do not like chocolate nor sesame mixed with sweets. My boyfriend thought it was delicious and was a big fan of the sesame whip and black sesame brittle, in particular)<br><br>In conclusion, we were really happy with our meal and our server (so sorry for not remembering her name) was a delight. She made sure to check on us semi-regularly and provided great information on the food, as well. Icing on the cake, Cassie, the sommelier, provided EXCELLENT wine recommendations for which my boyfriend was OVER THE MOON. She was so nice and she also checked on us, here and there, throughout our meal.

If you want to impress a date or have a nice meal with a friend, this is a sure winner. <br><br>-johnny applecheese (5/5): served warm and comes with chili cheddar butter (heaven!) and apple butter. You MUST order at least one of their breads and if you're really smart, order two! They're the cheapest thing on the menu ($5) and quite possibly the most memorable and addictive. <br>-kohlrabi salad (3/5): overall a nice salad with fresh apple slices, but the evalon goat cheese was too overpowering for my liking. If you like the strong taste of blue cheese, this might be right up your alley<br>-hamachi crudo (5/5): light and refreshing, I just wish the portion was larger!<br>-goat empanadas (4/5): comes with 2 smallish empanadas, not a lot of goat meat inside but a good introduction to goat meat. Did not taste gamey at all. <br>-roasted pig face (4.5/5): one of their most popular dishes, definitely must order this! The pig face meat is extremely tender and rich. You mix it with the fried egg and potato sticks. <br>-chocolate cake with shiitake gelato (5/5): this was amazing! the chocolate cake was warm and I didn't really get any strong shiitake taste with the gelato but it was delicious.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UpQ-yp18rFJAYNn5IOublA/348s.jpg", "caption": "Hamachi crudo"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uzAmE8v4NCY_YZcdtNg0dA/168s.jpg", "caption": "johnny applecheese with cheddar butter and apple butter"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PUXdOBrEjK3gipIpjxWtJQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "kohlrabi salad and johnny applecheese"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "What you, ,,zz c bcz bXx.

The most tender bite-through calamari, delicate goat cheese, and perfectly crisp bread. I'll be dreaming about this dish forever. <br>2. Roasted Cauliflower - It was full of flavor. I loved the pine nuts on top. <br>3. Pig Face - This is literally a pig's face. I had no idea what to expect, but it was served with an egg and potato shreds. It tasted a bit like a breakfast hash, but nonetheless very tasty and the meat was so tender. <br><br>I would go back every time I visit Chicago. <br><br>Pro tips:<br>- Go right before 4:30pm (opening time) - a line up will start to form out the door and around the corner before it opens, but you'll for sure get seated.

Next came the cauliflower, which was vibrant and fresh, bursting with flavor! Then came the calamari bruschetta. This was ok, but our least favorite dish of the evening. It was definitely not bad, but it was missing the wow factor that the other dishes had. Finally, we ended with the pork shank. Everything about this dish is perfect.

There was a bit of a hiccup with our reservation (made last minute by a friend who knows people in high places), so the evening started by us feeling a bit like imposters.<br><br>Our server took a while to get to our table, but when he showed up, he was really attentive and fun. We started with the fried oysters with egg salad (stingray something?), and they were freakin' phenomenal: creamy and crispy and salty and perfect. We were told that we needed to try the sautÃ©ed green beans, and we're so glad we did because they were heaven in a bowl, and tasted like an umami New Year's Eve party in your mouth. Amazingly, the green beans were our favorite dish of the night.<br><br>The next dish, the vitello tonnato was really confusing in terms of concept. They did a thick-cut tartare on the veal, but served it with the thinnest possible tuna tartare chip, so not the best food-to-mouth delivery system. Plus, the chip couldn't sop up any of the heirloom sauce on the plate, so that mostly went wasted. Maybe put the chips on top as a garnish and include some bread? The roasted cauliflower was good, but nothing special. Our final dish, the confit goat belly, which we were really excited about, was not good at all and the worst dish of the night. The goat itself was tender and delicious, but the whole thing came with the most cloying sauce of what seemed like pure honey and ruined the delicate taste of the accompanying lobster and crab. Bummer.<br><br>What else? The four cocktails we tried were great, and our two favorites were the gin rubus and the best of three with Pimm's. For dessert, we got the cherry bombe, which was perhaps a spin on tartufo. It was delicious, but the ice cream was so cold/hard-set that it was difficult to eat. <br><br>Final thoughts: extraordinary food in an extraordinary space (and worth going to for the green beans alone), but sadly not in the echelon of what we determine to be five stars because of the (above) snafus. We would, however, eagerly recommend Girl & the Goat for anyone wanting a memorable meal in Chicago.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "After many years we finally got in!

We were told that the wait is approx 1.5 hours, as expected, we went to the restroom, came up and saw two spots opened in the sidebar, lounge area. To our surprise, we can actually order food there. Since we didn't want to wait 1.5 hours, we decided to go ahead and have dinner there instead. Score. the full menu was available and we got way too lucky finding a spot there.<br><br>We decided to order four dishes to share. Lets just start by saying that dishes are on the smaller side here, so either have a snack before, or plan to have one after. We ordered the following:<br><br>Hamachi Crude: delicate pieces of hamachi, maybe six?, pork belly bits, and a chili aoili, with super thin bread croutons on top. This dish was visually stunning. Flavor wise, i think it would have been sufficient without the aioli. I felt that it was too heavy for the delicate fish, but a nice supplement to the meal.<br><br>Sauteed green beans: Fish sauce vinaigrette and cashews with green beans, this was super bomb. the flavors were so bold, tangy, sour, and bold. Surprisingly the portion was very large. this was a great dish to start with to cut through the heaviness of some of the other dishes.<br><br>Pig Face: This dish was everything and more, It's their version of steak and eggs/spam and egg whatever you want to call it. I love the complexity of this dish with the multi-facet textures and flavors with ingredients that we all recognize. This is a must order. Make sure you mix everything up to get the full range of flavors. <br><br>Goat belly: we had the goat belly that night, special for the night. It was a nice slab of tender goat belly, surrounded with bits of lobster and fish with a vanilla bourbon olive olive sauce? This was probably my least favorite dish of the night. The flavors just didn't mesh well at all. The sweetness of the sauce, did not compliment the goat belly as I wouldve liked. <br><br>Although this place is super hyped up, it's worth a try. We probably spent about $80 for two people, which isnt too bad (no drinks go).<br><br>i would suggest coming with more people just so you can try more variety of dishes and entrees.<br><br>Parking is hard to find, take the train instead.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zCoXcwJ8F4QXuKVJ50lBzw/348s.jpg", "caption": "Roast string beans with fish sauce vinaigrette"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/miPWs9lwi9tgC0buSSuiRA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Pig face.

Â There were some spirits too and the little pieces of pork belly made it nice...but I wouldn't have been fine without it. Â It's all about that fish!

The flavored and the tenderness and that egg! You mix it all together with that crispy pieces of potato! Oh my goodness this dish is super amazing!!! That red-wine maple gave it that subtle sweetness, and while I may not taste tamarind I'm sure it gave it that tiny kick of tangibles that balance this savory dish out. Oh man this was good! <br><br>PAN-FRIED SHISHITO PEPPERS - $11<br>Parmesan, Sesame, Miso.<br>They say only one out of a hundreds Shishito peppers is spicy, and when it's spicy, it's REALLY spicy! Â In this bowl there were 2 and I got one of them! I should buy a lottery ticket! Actually maybe just. A raffle from some small school charity...heh. Anywho, some of the peppers were red but each of them was covered in the wonderful flavors of Parmesan cheese and miso! This is a pretty greasy appetizer from all the sesame oil but it's fun and full of flavor! It's like playing a roulette game!<br><br>GRILLED BABY OCTOPUS - $17<br>Guanciale, Green Beans, Brussels Leaves, Pistachios, Lemon Vinaigrette.<br>There's a strong lemon vinaigrette flavor to this but it IS seafood. Â This dish is fine but not a favorite for me...it definitely tastes healthier then everything else we ordered too!

Good, and very refreshing.<br><br>Goat Empanada: Figured we order some goat after all it is in the name of the restaurant. My friends are not very adventurous when it comes to food so I figured this would be a good in-between for us, and it was! It was tasty, and I enjoyed the blend of flavors mixed into it. It came with some picked radishes that added a cooling touch to it. <br><br>Calamari Bruschetta: Calamaris were not super chewy and just the right amount of tender. The bruschetta or as I like to call it, the bread part, seemed fried instead of toasted. The texture was just right, and you can tell they put a delicious amount of butter on it. Would recommend!<br><br>Escargot Ravioli: I do enjoy ravioli, and I do enjoy escargot. I enjoy both of these things separately, and I was very curious as how they would be together. The result was satisfying! The raviolis were tightly packed, and the crispy onions that come with it added a good amount of crunch to it. The sauce was tangy and flavored the dish well. <br><br>Roasted Broccoli: YUM. I usually do not order roasted vegetables when I am out, because well, roasted vegetables....LOL, but I was pleasantly surprised here. The broccoli tasted fresh, and it was soft. They had like a kind of rice crispy placed all over it, and there was a kind of blue cheese like sauce to flavor it. I really enjoyed this dish, and it happens to be my second favorite dish here. <br><br>Pork Shank: OKAY the star of the show is here. This was my favorite dish here. The meat slid off the bone very easily, and the meat was soft and tender, but not dry. That's very important to me. It came with a nan that seemed to be cooked with alcohol and picked butternut squash. There were also two house made sauces: buffalo kimchi and ranch. Both sauces were great, but my favorite of the two is the buffalo kimchi. I liked making a wrap with the nan, kimchi buffalo sauce and the pork. It was amazing to me that as the dish got cold, the nan did not harden, but remained soft. This dish reminded me of the peking duck, green onion and hoisin in a steamed bun. Both of these dishes, very comforting to me!<br><br>Service here was excellent. We had a very friendly server, and our water glasses were never empty. They were always filled without asking.

The overpriced food is mediocre, and the service is absolutely horrible.

The only plus I would give this place is the music and atmosphere. <br><br>I went to this restaurant on a Saturday evening and had a reservation for three people. My friends and I come from LA, Â Miami, and NYC so we understand the importance of reviews and thought that such high reviews for this place was worth us giving it a shot. We were wrong.<br><br>When we sat down, we asked the waitress if they served sangria. She responded, \"No, this isn't a Spanish restaurant.\" Her ignorant response from the get-go changed the mood for my friends and I. There are many testaurants who serve sangria and are not \"Spanish.\" It was a simple and fair question we asked. Not only that, but this place serves goat empanadas as well as many other small plates that have a huge Spanish influence on their menu...<br>In addition to the poor service, this place needs to stop promoting the whole concept of \"sharing\" the meals because they aren absurdly small. There is no-where on the menu that markets the small plates as tapas so that is misguiding for someone who is looking to actually enjoy a thorough meal without having to spend $100 plus becusee they have to get 3-4 small plates to make it one full meal. My friends and I who don't normally eat that much ended up ordering 3-4 plates each for ourselves and when we left, we went to another restaurant called Au Cheval which is right across the street to eat our actual dinner. I ordered the blue-point oysters for appetizer and they were bland for oysters that were seasoned and cooked. I ordered the goat liver with bread and that was also bland. Their sauces were not bad but the goat liver had no flavor. I ordered the salmon dinner and that was so small I had to order another plate so I got the half grilled chicken (emphasizing half a chicken) which ended up being chopped into 4 very small pieces. The grilled chicken was good but for a main course meal, the small portions should have been served as an appetizer as the size of the chopped \"half chicken\" are bite sizes. Each time our meals would be served to us, they would put it in the middle of the table and we would tell the staff, \"no this is just for me,\" the staff would still place it in the middle of the table and walk away immedtiately as if they were annoyed with us. I get it--the restaurants \"philosophy\" is \"sharing\" but how in the world can you share a plate that takes one to two bites to finish?! After all of that, my friends and I were still hungry so we asked for our check and left. <br><br>I see this restaurant being \"raved and highly spoken of\" for maybe another year or so but I have a feeling the reviews will go lower as the prices and services doesn't validate for the quality of the food. They need to make this known as a FULL TAPAS restaurant and STOP the whole \"sharing\" of the meals. Our bill for three people Â ended up being $250.

I was a little curious about that when they seated us at a counter right in front of the kitchen staff. I'm thinking to myself \"How are these the best seats?\" Well, they were right. They were and it made our night so much more fun. Special thanks to Chris, Kenny, and Micha (Mika) for being such good dining company/entertainment! They gave us the inside scoop of what to order and hooked us up with some dishes. They were hilarious and so friendly. The staff made it seem like this restaurant was the best place to work in the whole world. Squirting sauce bottles at each other, mocking managers, and just having what seemed like more fun than any patron in the restaurant. <br><br>Food (4 stars):<br>They have ruined vegetables for me and my husband. In my head, how can anybody make vegetables this delicious? To the point where my non-veggie eating husband said that he would eat this in a heartbeat again and again. He even told me that he couldn't go back to eating my vegetables anymore. We ordered the broccoli and cauliflower. Both were perfect cooked. Perfect texture, but the kicker here was the seasoning. The cauliflower had a touch of mint which I thought was genius. It gave it such a refreshing, unique flavor. I would never thought. Our favorite though was the broccoli. Think BBQ broccoli. It really did taste like they put it on a grill with a slab of hot meat. I've never had broccoli this good before. <br><br>Another not-to-miss dish is the pig face. Remember the pig face. You will not be disappointed with the pig face. Think an updated version of corn beef hash. When it comes out, you mix everything thing together (the sauces, runny egg, and pig) and then this dish is complete. Wonderful balance of sweet, savory, and crunch. I would be happy if this was my last meal on earth. <br><br>I had my first experience with escargot, brussel sprouts, and goat here. All good and made me open to more. This is my ranking of the other dishes we ate. <br><br>Escargot dumplings (dumpling dough was extremely well done and soft)<br>Goat empanadas (not out of this world, but not bad)<br>Baby octopus salad (too charred) <br>Ham frites (please don't order this when there are so many other better things on the menu. My husband loves his fries, but this was just basically fries with special dipping sauce)<br><br>When we asked for the bill and decided against dessert, our waiter still decided that we couldn't leave without eating something sweet. He brought us a complimentary chocolate cake covered with ice cream, chocolate sauce, and toffee bits. Now that's what I call service above and beyond the call of duty! Such a great way to end a meal!<br><br>Overall:<br>This is a Chicago must! Don't worry about waiting 2 hours or so. It will be worth it in the end. Stephanie Izard is a monster chef. Her food should not be missed. <br><br>Tip #1: You can order half portions on certain dishes like the vegetables so you can try more dishes. <br><br>Tip #2: It's tapas style so expect to order at least 2 dishes per person.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/q-hUvOJJNFza3-SVfUxoFQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Goat empanadas"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/W0F6V91H0COKtjWxUrj54Q/168s.jpg", "caption": "Ham frites"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "This is a restaurant you hear multiple things about when looking up best places to eat in Chicago. You'll even find that it's really difficult to get a reservation - we made ours months in advance. The service is good, though I almost felt rushed throughout the entire meal like they were trying to turn the table. Cocktails are good, and on par with other cocktail prices in Chicago ($12-$14). We started with the roasted cauliflower, and dang, they are roasted to perfection. That whole dish was very addictive, and it comes served in a small cast iron. The sauce and seasoning was perfect. We also tried the goat empanadas, because we figured we had to get goat something! They are served with a pineapple blueberry salsa, avocado smash and queso fresco. A delicious queso fresco cheese to be exact. These went quickly. The goat isn't overly gamey like I suspected it to be, but a lighter meat that went very well in the empanadas. The waiter said the halibut was one of the more popular choices on the menu, so we decided to try that as well. It is very light, and served with a delicious almond butter sauce. Lastly, we tried the oven roasted pig face, which is another popular item. It comes served with a fried egg on top, and the yolk just melts into everything. This was my favorite plate, by far. The pig face is so incredibly tender and flavorful. I highly recommend ordering it. There are also some smaller crispy potato stix in there, with a delectable wine-maple glaze on top.

It is cooked perfectly, the Parmesan (?) on top is great and if you don't like pine nuts. push them off to the side. <br>Halibut- I love fish- i love my fish plain.

I did not love this dish because it had a hint of lemon it in. <br>Pork Shank- now this is an item to have dreams about.

I am not a fan of pork, but this pork shank comes out looking like a turkey leg, you get it and your like wow fried pork, but no it is so much more than that.

It is owned by the 1st female Top Chef Winner Stephanie Izard - so my expectations were raised right there. Reservations are really hard to get.

My GF and I were celebrating a special occasion, so I noted that on the OpenTable reservation.<br><br>We got there on time and got seated 10min after. We were told that we could either be seated immediately or wait 10min for the \"best seat in the house\". We waited and we were mind blown. We were seated right in front of the cooking line! We literally saw the chefs cut, cook, bake, fry, prep, plate, season and complete dishes which was a very unique experience! Definitely a great start to our meal. I also loved how every chef in the line greeted us and had a smile the entire time. One thing that will always stick with me is the girl yelling \"NADAS!\" whenever an Empanada order was ready.<br><br>Roasted Cauliflower - pickled peppers. pine nuts. mint: This was probably the best cauliflower dish I've had and I'm not a fan of cauliflower. Every bite was perfect and flavorful. <br><br>Chickpea Fritter - garam masala yogurt. heirloom tomato. stonefruit. sheep's feta: The best way to describe this dish is fried hummus blocks. The fritters were perfectly fried - very light and not oily - and the inside had a hummus like texture. The tomato gave it the acidic touch it needed to cut into the richness of the fritter. Feta cheese gave it a nice saltiness. I loved this dish.<br><br>Seared Diver Scallops - peaches. sweet onion. plums. pickled corn. mustard greens. uni cream: My least favorite dish of the night. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't as great as the rest. Scallops were cut into small pieces, mixed with some pasta and served to us. They say it was uni cream sauce, but I was not able to taste uni at all.<br><br>Ham Frites - smoked tomato aioli. cheddar beer sauce: Fancy fries. Lol.<br><br>Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face - sunny side egg. tamarind. cilantro. red wine-maple. potato stix: This is a MUST GET dish here. Pig face?! Yes. Pig Face. You don't get the actual pig face. My guess is that they use the pigs face meat to elaborate this complex and delicious dish. The meat was crispy, fatty and tender. It melted in my mouth. The runny egg yolk gave it a creaminess that went well with the dish. Ugh I WANT THIS RIGHT NOW. <br><br>Miso-Butterscotch budino - sesame gelato. sesame whip. glazed pineapple: Dessert on the house. I appreciate the gesture. Who doesn't like free ice cream?! Budino is more like pudding. It was sweet and salty and it went extremely well with the gelato.<br><br>I definitely recommend this place.

Not as much flavor as I would have wanted and I think would have benefited from a sauce more than a pico de gallo.<br><br>-Sugo (3.5/5) - Basically a pork-based sauce smothering bucatini and baby carrots - Sort of a pork spaghetti. Gooseberries sweetened it up a little bit!<br><br>-Breadstick buns (4/5) - tasted like soft breadsticks and went great with the accompanying tomato jam<br><br>Things you HAVE to order:<br>-Wood oven roasted pig face - This is probably the most yelp'd photo for G&TG so chances are you've seen the picture, It's a great piece of pork topped with a sunny side up egg with some cilantro and potato stix. The pork has great flavor and an awesome crunch all the way around the outside skin. So good.<br><br>-Calamari Bruschetta - This was my dark horse for best dish of the night for me. I wasn't sure how much I'd enjoy it with the goat milk ricotta and green tomatoes but holy hell did these things go well together. The calamari mixed with everything in one bite was delicious. Each bite of calamari I had tasted like it had its own personal char on it which I loved.<br><br>-Crisp braised pork shank - Nothing too fancy going on here except a great cook on a pork shank. The skin was so crispy and once you got past that crunch, the meat of the pork was just fell apart. Mixed with the naan and the kimchee(nectarine kimchee while we were there), this was the second best bite I had during the meal.<br><br>-For the star of the night for myself and a couple others in our group... the chili shrimp with Â sweet corn esquites. I've had some great corn this summer but this might be the best out of all of them. The shrimp were of course cooked perfectly with a good smokiness to them and then mixing that in a bite with the corn just stole the show.

My husband and I made reservations here to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. Plus I was running the next day in the Hot Chocolate Race and did not want to eat too heavily. Now the review-<br><br>Waiting-<br><br>Make reservations! This place is quite popular. It will make your experience even better.<br><br>Atmosphere-<br><br>Casually posh. What that means is no sports tvs. No peanuts on the bar area. Waitstaff does not wear shorts or gym shoes....unless it's Halloween. :-) More about that.<br><br>Dress code-<br><br>I over dressed. Jeans are just fine. Ladies you can get away with ballet flats. Gentleman-you can leave the jacket and tie at home. I did not see anyone in any type of sports jersey so you may not want to get \"THAT\" casual. A golf shirt or office casual with jeans will work for you here. Just to let you know how flexible they are with the dress code-Since it was Halloween weekend one patron was dressed in a slip. Scary because 1) it was a slip and 2) it was pretty nippy so no idea what her costume was supposed to represent.<br><br>Wait staff-<br>It was Halloween. All were dressed pretty creatively. One of the bartenders was dressed as a one of the queens from Alice in Wonderland. No big deal but it was a guy. My favorite though was one of the attentive staff members who was in charge of water. He was dressed as a banana and had the best smile.<br><br>First menu item-<br>Ham Frites. I thought it would be deep fried Paula Deen style ham cut in slivers and breaded. NOPE! Way more creative and delicious. Ham frites are shoe string fries with crisp bits of ham and some amazing seasoning. I could not stop eating them! Beer sauce and tomato aioli also delish as dipping sauces.<br><br>Serving sizes-<br>Before I move on just a word about the serving sizes. Dishes are made to share so don't feel offended when the wait staff recommends ordering 4 items. Girl and Goat is pretty reasonable priced considering their creative menu. Let's move on.<br><br>2nd dish-Pig Face-It's not what you think! Â <br>If it was, I would not allow it on the table. As other reviewers have noted, its 's a sunny side egg covering pork loin (?) elevated on a bed of hash brown like potatoes. This dish could almost pass as breakfast. I am not a sunny side egg person so I ate everything underneath. The pork was tender. It's grilled not fried and the potatoes underneath were also good but they will never beat the ham frites. In fact any frites or fries I have in the future will never beat the ham frites.<br><br>3rd dish-Roasted cauliflower-very good. I can't quite rave about it. It comes with pickled peppers. To me it was a smidge too spicy however the platter they were served on was sent back...empty! <br><br>4th dish and my fav-bleu cheese sweet potato Pierogies. <br>Pierogies are a second staple to pizza in Chicago. Remember Mrs. T pierogies anyone anyone? I would have never thought of this combo of food. You get a creamy salt taste of goodness. If you want something soft on the palate and not extra heavy, this dish fits that need. Off the charts delicious. If you need a carb fix but you don't want to do a typical pasta or bread, then get this.<br><br>Dessert-caramel corn and malt balls plus chocolate cake. We did not get two because of being piggish. One was given to us with a candle wishing us a happy anniversary. That was a surprise to us! I enjoyed the chocolate cake very much and definitely like the malt balls. They were accompanied by vanilla malt gelato which took things to a whole different level.<br><br>There is goat served here but we did not try it. Sorry. <br><br>You will not be disappointed at all unless you are one of those types that can only eat chicken fingers or a burger.

Â After many long years of waiting I was finally able to try this long awaited restaurant when I most recently visited Chicago. I visited on a Saturday night and as expected, it was crowded and we had to wait a few minutes for our table. We grabbed some drinks at the bar which were good and strong. It is located in the West Loop neighborhood which is the quickly becoming the hip new area of Chicago. If you dine here, make some extra time to explore this neighborhood. <br>For dinner, we were told to order 2-3 dishes each as it is tapas style. We ordered eight dishes for our table of four. I think that was too much as we were all stuffed by the time dinner was over and there was food still left over. I'd recommended 1.5 dishes each as I think we would have been better off without 1-2 of the dishes we ordered. My favorite, favorite, favorite dish was the chickpea fritter. I could have eaten two plates of those. The Grilled Yellow Fin Tuna was also a big hit as well as the oyster. I would suggest skipping out on the Pan Fried Shishito Peppers because they were pretty dry and unappealing as well as the Ham Frites which were pretty much McDonald's fries. Overall, the dishes that were great were unanimously loved and a big hit for our entire table. They were unique and delicious. However, there were some dishes that no one really enjoyed. It was a hit or miss with the food. <br>The service is great- the waitress was friendly, accommodating, and quick. She suggested different items on the menu honestly and based on our preference. It did seem slightly understaffed as we had to flag her down a few times towards the end of our meal.

Otherwise, you will be stuck going to eat at a really weird time. If you want to try just coming here without a reservation, the wait is usually pretty long but you may be able to get a seat at the bar earlier. You can still order food at the bar area. If you really want to sit in the dining area, Fulton Market is full of places you can just go grab a drink to wait. I like Maude's for a cocktail while waiting. Or Green Street Smoked Meats for a beer...though you might just end up eating the bbq there.<br><br>Now to the food! I've been here a few times. A couple of times with a party of four and once with a big enough party to justify getting the goat leg. I think we had a party of eight for the goat leg. The goat leg is delicious, and if you have a big enough party - you should try it! It comes with pita bread, and a bunch of different sauces. When we had it, they also gave us sliced hard-boiled egg and I think crispy potato strings. <br><br>I think it's worth it to come here with at least a party of four so you can try many different things. I'll review the things I've tried here because everything looks super delicious - but there are a few really standout dishes.

Everytime I've come, they change the spreads that come with the bread, but they're always really good. The bread is worth getting because it's that awesome freshly baked, soft on the inside, warm amazing type of bread. Definitely recommend. <br><br>I think if you come here and you're a meat eater, you should 100% get the pork shank and the pig face. I know pig face sounds weird, but I think it's the pig cheek meat that they put in there. It comes with pig face meat, sweet maple gastrique, viniagrette, crispy potato sticks and a runny egg. You mix everything up and man, this is seriously one of the best dishes I've ever had. <br><br>The pork shank is another must try. The meat is so tender, and it falls right off the bone. It comes with pita bread and a vegetable I think (squash?). It is so good. The other dishes I've had here are good, but not rave-worthy good. To me, the pig face and the pork shank are the real stand-outs. The broccoli and cauliflower are great options if you want a vegetable - very flavorful and yummy. The diver scallops and escargot dumplings are good too if you want a seafood option. For some reason, we always get the ham frites here because they're a pretty good side to much on. They usually are served early, so if you're hungry you can eat some of those fries before everything else comes.

The bday girl asked the server which dish she liked best, and the server responded with \"it doesn't matter what I like, it matters what you like.\" We also asked her opinion on which bread we should order, and she said \"it's bread; it's warm and buttery.\" My friend dropped one of the three goat empanadas on floor that night and we were too off-put by our server's attitude to mention anything (read: we were now scared of her), but one of the table bussers saw what happened and got us a replacement empanada.

For peak hours, you need a reservation about two months in advance. The food, ambiance, and service were all great. I had heard of the hype and had to experience it for myself. We had a Second City show at 8:00 and the server was incredibly accommodating and helped bring out the dishes quickly. We started with the cranberry bread that came with jam and some other spread. Would not recommend the other spread because it had an awful aftertaste. Next, I got the chickpea fritters, which had the texture of fried goat cheese. Not super memorable. I also opted for the pig's face because it was highly recommended. The egg on top perfectly complimented the rough texture of the pig's face. My favorite dish was the grilled cuttlefish, which came with pistachios. I loved the contrasting grilled taste and the lemon vinaigrette. Overall, the bill was over $80 with tax and tip.

The only problem is that snagging a reservation at a reasonable time is damn near impossible. We ended up booking 2 months in advance and still had to settle for a 9PM Sunday night time slot haha. By the time it was the weekend we were going, I actually completely forgot we even made the reservation.<br><br>All this advanced planning was just building up some massive expectations for the food. But I gotta say that Stephanie Izard and team totally delivered. It was easily one of my favorite meals I've had in Chicago so far. <br><br>For as hot of a restaurant this is, I actually thought the prices were pretty reasonable. Our group ordered a ton of stuff and got to try a little bit of everything, and it was still cheaper than a steak at Gibsons.<br><br>Food: I wasn't about to make 9PM Sunday dinners a habit, so we made it a point to order everything in sight as if there wouldn't be a next time. Luckily we had a big enough group to even try the massive goat leg too. <br><br>Chickpea fritter - A really tasty deep fried ball of hummus basically. Crispy on the outside, and smooth and creamy in the inside.<br><br>Sauteed greeen beans - Even though I generally don't like fish, I ironically love the taste of fish sauce for some reason (probably because of Filipino patis), so I enjoyed the salty vinaigrette in this dish.<br><br>Roasted cauliflower - They must be doing something right if I actually enjoyed eating veggies. Solid side.<br><br>Hamachi crudo - I just saw the words crispy pork belly on the menu and automatically ordered this. I didn't even realize it was a fish dish. I'm not the biggest seafood fan so it was far from my favorite bite.<br><br>Escargot ravioli - You couldve filled those suckers with anything and I still would've eaten it. The pasta was thin and fresh, and that sauce that was coating the ravioli was delicious. I just wish there was more. <br><br>Goat empanada - It pained me to split the empanada into thirds because it was so good. I could've eaten a ton of these. Crunchy and flaky crust with a juicy, meaty filling. <br><br>Ham frites - Eh. They were tasty but nothing more than fries with some sort of ham flavored dust on top. The dipping sauces were pretty money though. <br><br>Pig face - I had really high expectations because everyone I talked to and all the reviews I read were raving so much about it. Again, it was tasty but nothing mind blowing. Maybe I don't appreciate jowl meat as much as I should, but when you mash it all together, it tastes like a regular breakfast dish to me. It was like a gourmet version of bacon, eggs, and hashbrowns. <br><br>Pork shank - THAT ORANGE SAUCE. What is it?? I still have no clue, but I could literally drink it. There was nothing better throughout that entire meal than dipping pieces of naan in whatever sauce that was. The meat on the pork shank was amazing as well. Nicely crisped outside followed by succulent and fatty meat that fell off the bone. Hands down best dish of the night. I'll order this again and again. <br><br>Goat leg - We honestly ordered this mostly for the experience. We had enough people so why the hell not. They brought out a huge board with a big goat leg surrounded by a bunch of different sauces. It also came with some crispy onions and a whole basket of naan. The meat was super tender. In fact, we literally pulled the bone out clean with no effort. Maybe I just like the taste of pork better than goat, but in retrospect I would definitely just order multiple pork shanks next time instead of this. Worth it to try once though.<br><br>Overall, gatg is probably one of my favorite restaurants in the city.

Cashews): This was a little bit on the salty side but the flavors were magical - the savoriness of the fish sauce + the rich cashew + fresh green beans...YES. I also love fish sauce + veggies (RIP Red Medicine). <br><br>*Wood Grilled Broccoli (Rogue Smokey Beu, Spiced Crispies): There's cereal in my broccoli?! YES. The broccoli was so wonderfully smoky from being wood grilled. Again, a little on the salty side but still tasty nonetheless <br><br>*Copper River Sockeye Salmon (Yellow tomato, vanilla bean yogurt, Sungold Salad, Spiced Peanuts): I really enjoyed how fresh this dish was. Beautiful colors with the tomato and cucumbers. Really well cooked Salmon. Why would one order Salmon at Girl & The Goat? When one is too pork'ed about from The Purple Pig. <br><br>*Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face (sunny side egg. tamarind. cilantro. red wine-maple. potato stix): I know this is THE thing to get here, so how come it's so low on my list? In my head, I imagined canto-style BBQ with an ACTUAL Pig's Face but of course, that's not appetizing is it? Haha. <br><br>*Escargot Ravioli (bacon. tamarind-miso sauce): The idea of Escargot freaks me out but figured that this was as good a time as any to try it. The ravioli was a little too mushy for my liking but, the sauce was divine. <br><br>*Goat Empanadas (Smoked Blueberry Tapenade. Avocado): This isn't exactly something I'd eat a lot of BUT I think it's a must try here. I didn't love the whole blueberries but weren't very incorporated in the dish itself.

When asking the waiter we could just order a couple dishes for smaller groups of people at the table (so that everyone could get the dishes they wanted and wanted to pay for) he was appalled and immediately said \"everything is to share, the menu is designed that way\" well...I get that, but we have a group of TEN.

I like the whole set up. <br><br>Service - Very good. Our server was attentive & food came out at a good pace. <br><br>As for the reservations part - we sat near the front, so I heard a lot of people coming in and some didn't have rezzies.

They do include some sort of Mango Kimchi. I don't like fusion Kimchi, so I barely at it, but my friends had it and enjoyed it. I'm drooling just thinking about this dish... YUM. I highly recommend this item, especially if your table wants to do a \"share each dish\" kind of thing!<br><br>Goat Liver Mousse - The bread/mini biscuit came out warm and smelled enticing. The taste of the bread was super good. Imagine a super good piece of bread along with Mousse, Jam, and some sort of Pickled Veggies. AHHH. Melted in my mouth. This dish was pretty big. Definitely shareable. But if one was only wanting this dish and nothing else, go at it. <br><br>Grilled Octopus & Spicy Chili Crab - if you like seafood and you like grilled items. I'd get these. Both dishes had bold and strong flavors and they were given in generous portions. The rice in the Spicy Chili Crab absorbed all the ingredients and was delicious. Grilled Octopus was done perfectly. Some places kind of fail at grilling this usually, but not G&TG! MMMM. <br><br>^ I should note... I rarely eat seafood. So... my taste buds are different. <br><br>Duck Tongues - I kind of thought this tasted like Chicken. I've never had Duck Tongue till now. So... not an expert.

The scallops were also seared to PERfection. <br>Sea bass (4/5): At first I thought the flavor was just ok, but as I continued to eat I really enjoyed the numbing sensation of the Schezuan peppercorns mixing with the yogurt sauce. <br>Pig face (5/5): Oh man this was so good too. The addition of the crispy potato shreds is a must, since the pig face is so soft it just melts in your mouth when paired with the gooey egg, so the contrast in texture is wonderful. Another stand out dish.<br>Pork shank (4.5/5): I really like this since it's a showstopper. This dish is HUGE so make sure to save some room. The naan is so soft and delicious and the pork shank is braised to fall-off-the-bone perfection. I wasn't a huge fan of the \"kimchi\" that accompanied this dish though.

Located in the west Loop neighborhood a couple miles or so west of Michigan Ave just north of Chicago's Greektown and positioned among a slew of other top notch restaurant destinations along Randolph Street you could easily miss it. The inside of the restaurant is good sized. The lights are dimmed and its fairly dark inside. The noise level is loud here so if you plan on carrying out some good conversation be prepared to yell. Seating includes tables, bar seating, and even couches and arm chairs set up around communal coffee tables for walk ins without reservations.

You are constantly being tended to by very professional and attentive wait staff. They are on the ball and constantly checking on you without being over bearing. All of my food and drink orders came out in very reasonable time and your server will even help you plan out a specific order to receive your food in to have the best taste experience. Don't hesitate to ask your server for a recommendation or any questions that you may have about specific dishes as they seem to be very knowledgeable on the menu.<br><br>Finally and most importantly: the food.

The flavors were rich and fresh and delicate.<br>The beet salad with suprising bursts of lemon was excellent! <br>The sushimi came next. I do not eat this but my friend LOVE it, said it might be the best thing she has ever eaten in her life. The raw fish with the crispy pork belly and lace thin crispy bread perfectly complimented each other.<br>Our wine and water was refilled constantly but without being obtrusive. <br>Then the potato perogis. Totally home made and fresh and light. The tomato relish burst with crisp, clean fresh ingredients and was a total mouth party. ( yep, I said MOUTH PARTY)<br>Then the broccoli with smoked bleu. I can eat that everyday! It was different and delicious and interesting.<br>Then the pig face. Um, it was good. Â It was too much for me to handle but my friend loved it. The presentation was beautiful, it was rich and crispy and I understand why people would love this item. ( the face part is what bothers me, eek.)<br>Clean plates were continuously exchanged.<br>Then the goat with the lobster and crab. The goat for me was a no-go, the lobster and crab were phenomenal, Â the sauce was devine. Â We did realize that part of the seafood was undercooked which was disappointing. Â We told the server, she apologized and removed the plate. The GM then approached our table and apologized as well.<br>Then, the dessert. You GUYS, THE DESSERT! <br>The blueberry burbon was IN-CRED-IBLE. I can't describe it, just go eat it.<br>The icecream with the homemade caramel corn and malt balls, deeeee-liciious.<br>The donut with maple, Y. U.

If you're not into the texture of the food, the oyster might not be for you. $12<br><br>Goats: failed to order something from this section. Boo hoo. The items are quite interesting too! <br><br>V:<br>-pan fried shishito peppers. Served in a bowl with melted Parmesan on top and sprinkled sesame seeds and a miso glaze. Peppers are with stems that are easily broken off and filled with edible seeds. A slight hint of spice. Good dish. $9<br>-wood grilled broccoli. A high stack of broccoli on top of the rogue smokey bleu cheese and spiced crispies. In a simple matter this is the fancy adult version of broccoli and cheese. Simple dish. $10<br><br>F: pan roasted halibut with marcona almond butter on top and pieces of white asparagus underneath with a blueberry nuoc cham to cover. Portion was about a 2x2 measurement. Buttery soft and delicious. The almond butter stood out as a complementing flavor. $19<br><br>M: <br>-grilled marinated pork belly. castelfranco (which is a pale yellow-green leafy vegetable) with green sauce and blackberries. These were thin slices of pork that didn't resemble the pork belly and fat that I'm used to. $15<br><br>-sugo. canestri pasta with a meat mixture of beef, pork and lamb with baby carrots and cape gooseberries. An enjoyable wholesome pasta dish. $15<br><br>-wood oven roasted pig face. Soft pieces of pork face with a sunny side egg on top and sprinkled tamarind and cilantro. red wine-maple was decorated along with potato stix. I would say this is a flavorful dish that a meat lover would devour. $18<br><br>-braised beef tongue. Thin slices of beef tongue and a crispy skin-like layers of something matched the tongue. Almost tasted like crispy duck skin. Could have been a rendition of masa (dough flour or the outside of a tamale) beef vinaigrette and salsa verde were mixed within the entree. A favorite dish of the night! $15<br><br>Desserts: beyond full to even enjoy a dessert. <br><br>The one incident that was odd was that the server didn't recognize anything about a special benefit via Lexus. If you show your key fob supposedly you were supposed to receive a nice surprise from the kitchen. However, the server did not know anything about it!

Â This place has been on my radar for quite some time now, and the only thing that kept me from checking it out sooner was the fact that the menu is a little bit eclectic and I'm absolutely no Andrew Zimmern when it comes to eating. Â I came here with a group of 10 people, mostly coworkers and we were assigned a long table in the back near the kitchen. Â The environment is a bit hectic but there's definitely something theatrical about watching all the line cooks crank out dish after dish. Â We were advised that the dishes are meant to be shared, which most of our table decided to do so, but being the stubborn and picky eater that I am, I wanted to do my own thing. Â The entire dinner was about 3 hours, and after ordering everything at once, the dishes started to emerge from the kitchen one by one. Â <br>So here's the run down- I had the pig face, pork shank, and goat empanadas and tried a little bit of the duck tongue. Â First with the pig face that has an egg on top- this dish is very rich and fatty and reminds me of a crispy pork belly. Â The empanadas was my first try of goat but they were very delicate. Â The goat meat inside was like a tender pulled pork that melts in your mouth and surprisingly worked with the strawberry pairing. Â And then of course the pork shank- this dish is surprisingly large and filling. Â It is well seasoned and fall of the bone and comes with an assortment of sides like sauces and naan. Â We even asked our waiter to wrap up the leftover pork shank bone for the dog and he went to town with it. Â Some other notables- the raw oysters were supposedly some of the best my boyfriend has had and the scallops were buttery and artfully prepared.

I was impressed the quality of the food and they were delicious. I loved the cauliflower and catfish but I wasn't a big fan of goat meat. It usually tasted gamey. The two of us barely finished all the food but we still tried the dessert, Pb&J since we were visitors. The combination of the texture like grapes, brittle, gelato and cake made this dish interesting. It was supposed to be a sweet dessert but not too overwhelmed sugary in the end. <br><br>The service was attentive and efficient. The deco was modern and trendy.

It's this brioche (so buttery and good) and the miso butter is so good with it. The kimchi relish was also good, but the miso butter is just so well paired with the brioche. Then we had the escargot dumplings. This was definitely not my favorite. There isn't this great escargot taste and the onions on top weren't crispy. Disappointing. The next dish - the goat loin. The ramp and potato puree - so good with the loin. It wasn't too game-y which I would be afraid of, but it was tender and so good. After, we got the scallops.

I booked probably 2 months ahead, and got a time near their dinner opening on Friday night. At around 4:15 (opening time is 4:30), I saw that they already had people lined up outside who were hoping to get seats without having a reservation. It looked like they were successful, so if you don't have a reservation, I recommend you go during non-peak hours for sure. <br><br>The food was awesome. I love how they crafted their menu items to be moderately-sized dishes (for the most part) that you share with the rest of your group. This lets you sample quite a few things on their menu. <br><br>Our waiter told us to not forget the veggies, as their veggie dishes are really excellent. We tried to get the chickpea fritters, Â it were told that the tasting of that dish that happened at 4 pm before the restaurant opened pushed the timing of the dish back such that it wouldn't be ready until 9 pm that evening, or perhaps not at all. I thought that was a pretty good move for the restaurant, not wanting to serve a dish that they didn't think was perfect. We ended up getting the roasted cauliflower -- and whoa, I have never been impressed with cauliflower before in my life until that dish came out! <br><br>We heard good things about the wood oven roasted pig face, which ended up being pretty good, although very heavy. I would have liked a little more of the tamarind or perhaps something more citrus-y to cut through the heaviness. Although the dish was not large, I felt very full even just after a few bites. Our waiter came by and mixed the dish up for us when he say they we weren't doing so enough, which was also nice. <br><br>Finally, we got the goat neck, which we were told ahead of time was a large dish so we didn't need to order much more after that. That was definitely a correct statement -- I never though goat necks were that big! But it was a really good part of the goat which I had not tried before. The meat was super tender, and just came right off with your fork. They prepare the near over a multi-day period and it comes out super rich, a little smokey, but not at all dry. The flavor is excellent, and the sauces paired with it are awesome as well. The vegetables on the bottom kind of got lost with the huge goat neck on top of it, and I would have liked a few more veggies in general. We ended up having to take some goat neck back home with us, and we left with several suggestions from our waiter about awesome goat neck leftover dishes. <br><br>Overall, an excellent experience. It seems like their menu changes pretty frequently, because a lot of the dishes mentioned in other posts were not on the menu when we were there. So, it looks like they have good variety in general and do a good job with all of their dishes.

What could possibly be that great about them?You will be addicted. Get them. <br>Pig Face - if it is your first time at Girl and the Goat - you must get this dish. If it is not - opt for the pork shank! <br>Pork Shank - ummm this one is a game changer. This was the last dish that was brought out and we were soo full but managed to eat most of it.

I would like a bottle of it. <br><br>Desserts:<br>Malt Balls - FYI, does not taste like whoppers. We were worried that it might but it is much better than the candy. Chocolate magic shell needs to have a comeback. <br>Beerimisu - lady fingers soaked in milk stout. A craft beer lover's dream and served in the cutest mug. <br>PB&J Cake - tastes exactly like PB & J but obviously a better, much chef-ier version! <br><br>I think I am reaching a character limit soon - but the kitchen table is awesome and everyone was so nice.

There is wood, brick, beautiful lighting, and interesting decorations. In terms of the look of the place, if you're from San Diego think Craft and Commerce but a larger space and bougie. If you're from Los Angeles think The Stocking Frame + the upscale feel of Perch.<br><br>THE FOOD:<br><br>Wow. Wow. Wow. I am in LOVE with GG's food. It was a group of four (4) of us and we tried a lot of things on the menu. The menu is split into vegetables, fish, meat, bread, oysters, goats, and desserts. The food is tapa-style and our waitress recommended getting a good amount of plates to share.<br><br>Here is the list of what we tried and my thoughts:<br><br>1. Wood Grilled Broccoli: rogue smokey bleu cheese. spiced crispies.<br>Even the non-brocolli eaters at the table could not get enough of this smokey and creamy treat. The broccoli was perfectly cooked - soft but also dense - and what made me smile were the rice crispies. So random but so perfect.<br><br>2. Hamachi Crudo: crisp pork belly. chili aioli. caperberries.<br>Very light and refreshing. The hamachi was topped with crispy flakes, there were small slices of jalapeÃ±os and pineapple, and it also came with pieces of juicy pork.<br><br>3. Ham Frites: smoked tomato aioli. cheddar beer sauce.<br>This platter is fries dusted in bacon with the sides of sauce noted above.<br><br>4. Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face: sunny side egg. tamarind. cilantro. red wine-maple. potato stix.<br>The pig face was roasted to perfection. It was semi-fatty and caramelized. The yolk oozed onto the meat and created creaminess. I loved this!<br><br>5. Braised Beef Tongue: masa. beef vinaigrette. salsa verde.<br>GG is very generous with the beef tongue in this dish. They fry the masa into a crispy chip and the rest of the plate is garnish and greens. the beef tongue was very tender.<br><br>6. Goat Empanadas: smoked blueberry tapenade. avocado.<br>I really enjoyed the empanadas because they were the right amount of crispy and dense. The empanadas came atop a bed of mashed avocado and were sprinkled with cheese. The chef throws some soft cherries on top. The cherries are more juicy than sweet.<br><br>7. Confit Goat Belly: bourbon butter. lobster n' crab. fennel.<br>The goat belly reminded me of the Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face (\"PF\") but the PF had a caramelized taste. This dish is a surf and turf option and comes upon a bed of what tasted to me like a smooth mashed potato but I could be wrong. Whatever it was, it was yummy.<br><br>8. Horchata Rice Pudding: rhubarb semifreddo. cinnamon toast crunch.<br>Putting my I'm Mexican -I love horchata - I love arroz con leche - bias aside, I can honestly say this is the BEST dessert I have ever had in my LIFE. Rhubarb? Really? YES! What an odd mix of texture and flavor and what a fabulous explosion of deliciousness in my mouth. This cold horchata ball (semifreddo - semi-frozen dessert) that won't melt sits atop a warm rice pudding. On the side they place the rhubarb, which is crunchy and tart, and then on top of it all goes their homemade cinnamon toast crunch in pieces and two big chips at the top. It was ridiculous!

It was a bit too strong for my liking. <br><br>* Pan Roasted Halibut (marcona almond butter, white asparagus, blueberry nuoc cham) $18 The highlight of the meal (!!!) 10/5<br>- Our server informed us that this was a seasonal item and that Chef Stephanie won the Top Chef competition with this dish. Well obviously we had to order this and I'm so glad that we did. It was soft and buttery and I could not get enough of it. It was my favorite dish of my trip and I tried a lot of memorable items.

While it was robust in flavor, and I enjoyed the first bite, it was a bit too fatty and dense for me to continue eating more spoonfuls of it. Jeff kept putting it on my plate and I just switched plates with him :P <br><br>* Confit goat belly with bourbon butter, lobster n' crab, fennel ($19) 2/5<br>- It would seem unpatriotic to not try goat as it's in it's name-sake So, based on another reviewer's recommendation we tried the goat belly.

So, I've learned over the years that as a single diner, I can almost always find a seat at the bar. My method held true tonight. <br><br>So, the chef, Stephanje Izard (a Top Chef alum, but lots of amazing chefs have never been in a tv competition), focuses on using the whole critter in dishes that walk a fine edge between \"What the Hell!\" and gastronomic Nirvana. A couple years ago I read a piece by an economist about making the most of your dining experiences. He essentially said, pick the thing that sounds the strangest, the thing you would normally eschew. Well, so far, that theory has served me pretty well, as it did tonight. Iota, however, still thinks I may be out of my mind even though she gobbled stuff down as fast as it came out--of course, this was after she screeched a bit. <br><br>We started with yummy brioche buns served with tomato jam and jalapeÃ±o butter. Next came the grilled shisito peppers (Iota: Aaaaoootterrrgaaonn? Translates to again? Really?) topped with sesame miso sauce. Completely different experience than at Garces' Mercat a la Planxa. <br><br>Then came the duck tongues. It took a bit of convincing to get Iota to slip one between clamped lips, but once she did, her eyes got big, and she grabbed a couple handfuls, which made the guy sitting next to her comment that he'd never seen a chimp with such and appetite (I suspect he'd never dined with a chimp before). This dish was amazing--really. Perfectly balanced unctuous and crispy and fresh and bright. The crispy fried duck tongues were warm and crunchy on the outside and rich as marrow on the inside. They were layered around a tuna-fermented black bean pokÃ© tossed with daikon strips and arugula all set on top of a piri piri sauce and topped with wonton strips. (Now, those of you who can't get past the tongue, you'd likely be all over it if I said it was crisply chicken skin instead of tongue, so get over it.)<br><br>And then we splurged with dessert--and if you wanna know about that, you'll have to go to dinner with me.

Bass was tender and melted in my mouth. The pork belly was full of flavors. A perfect combination. Then we had the Bucatini. I never tried it before but I'm truly impressed.

Â for us since we had 6 people we asked for 1 more and they gave us 4 more for free! The pate itself was pretty smooth and good, I couldn't tell it was goat versus anything else I've had. Â It also comes with three other toppings. Â A salsa type, picked vegetables and then a berry jam. Â The jam was my favorite to put on top of the pate. Â Overall, a good dish and filling!<br><br>PORK SHANK - Came last and was our least favorite. Â It's big and you have plenty for 6 people but some of it was slightly dry. Â Kind of tasted like a turkey leg but much less flavor. Â There were fatty pieces but overall kind of stringy. Â The naan bread was good, almost more like a pita cut in triangles. Â The kimchi sauce was slightly tangy but I liked the ranch/buttermilk sauce better.<br><br>PIG'S FACE - Their signature dish, so we ordered 2 of these. Â Comes with a fried egg on top and almost like a fatty pulled pork underneath with some crispy onions. Â Very tasty, very fatty and very flavorful. Â I don't think I could eat more than 1/3 of the dish though without feeling a little OD'd.<br><br>CAULIFLOWER - surprisingly really good and refreshing. Â it has mint and other spices which help elevate the flavors. Â What we liked about girl and the goat was that everything is jam packed with unique flavors. nothing was bland or just \"ordinary\" but had really good tastes.<br><br>OCTOPUS - another one of my favorites. Â lots of good flavors, slightly savory with pieces of octopus, fava beans etc. <br><br>SCALLOPS - 2 large scallops so splitting between 6 of us meant a small sliver but still tasty. Â this one had a different taste than the octopus. If I had to choose I liked the octopus flavors more. Â Scallop wasn't overcooked and perfectly seared.<br><br>HAM FRITES - basically shoe string cut fries dusted with ham that taste like bacon. Â Reminded me of baked potato fries. Â The fries themselves were a little hard and not as crispy as I would like but a good staple for a group.

So not sure if coming a second time, that magic wore off somehow? The food fell a little short for me on round two, hence my 4 star review. <br><br>First, the interior is nice, but it is pretty typical of most interiors I think for the current trendy restaurant scene. Dark interior, bar area, high ceilings, open kitchen, some exposed brick. And the bar area is pretty small, but if you can't manage to get a reservation (which yes you should be making 2-3 months in advance if not earlier since this place is seriously always booked....) you could try the bar area at off peak times and see if you can snag some space. <br><br>Menu wise, I love the small plates sharing concept, and the crispy pig face really is that tasty. The flavors are just all there and so balanced, this dish was great. They make their own breads here as well, and I like that each time I had different bread choices. Their roasted beets were pretty tasty and their chickpea fritters as well. The calamari bruschetta in our most recent visit was a great rec from our server, since that clam juice in the bread is pretty awesome. But the goat empanadas fell short for us and the green beans were just like other green beans we've had elsewhere. So like I said, the first visit was amazing.

Who wouldn't??) but she advised against it for a solo diner because it's so rich and filling. this restaurant is meant to be approached \"family style\" ordering multiple dishes not unlike tapas (but actually good). Some dishes can also be ordered in \"mini\" half portions which is fantastic for someone who wants to just try something but not necessarily fill up on it. <br><br>I mentioned my interest in seafood and she pointed me out to the salmon. I originally looked passed it because I am a salmon and pea junkie at home- I eat it about 2x a week if not more, and have a dedicated shoe box just for my Trader Joe's petite pea collection in my freezer along with my bulk bag of salmon from Costco. Did I really travel halfway across the country to eat what I usually have? Well, thank god Alex was there because because it totally reapproached peas and salmon in a new light. The salmon was interpreted in a Japanese fashion channeling ramen with a rich goat dashi and nori, peas, and popcorn furikake. Lemon zest dots the furikake imparting bright, citrus aromas. The tender, sweet asparagus cuts up the rich flavors like a culinary intermission. This dish was truly an experience! <br><br>The roasted cauliflower went beautifully with the mint and lemon. My \"least favorite\" dish of the night was the goat carpaccio but that itself was fantastic. I'm not much of a goat eater but the meat has a surprisingly mild flavor. Paired with the smoke trout roe and olive slivers, it simultaneously channeled smoked salmon with capers and sashimi at the same time. <br><br>Last but not least were my TWO desserts. I do not normally order dessert. I don't even have much of a sweet tooth, but I thought- why not, let's just have the full course. I was eyeballing the horchata rice pudding with the rhubarb semifreddo but Alex asked me to trust her and gently suggested the toffee cake. Best. dessert. ever. The candied cashews were incredible. The toffee cake was incredible. Everything about this dessert was incredible. Once again, I'm not a dessert person, and I would order this again in a heartbeat. She sent out the rice pudding anyways for me to try, and despite being utterly fantastic as well, the toffee cake is where it's at! <br><br>I am floored by the quality of food and the level of service for the price I paid. Such quality, well-prepared food in such an unpretentious environment, almost unheard of where I am. I just wanted to cry knowing that I live almost 700 miles away from this place. <br><br>I don't like to repeat myself when I travel but honest to goodness, this is not a place you want to skip over if you're dropping into town. I know I'm going out of my way to fit G&tG into my itinerary next time I'm in Chicago (and I will find someone to try the goat leg and pig face!)", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oa0DjO2v9mPqJ5nszZ07Bg/348s.jpg", "caption": "Could not finish my double dessert."}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IMYzzZssUI2VOtnXiklMqg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Close up of goat carpaccio"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/m5OJInF00TA6Vha4FoY3Vw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Goat carpaccio with olives, frisÃ©e, smoked salmon roe."}]}}, {"review": {"des": "My boyfriend & I decided to walk in on a Saturday night & luckily grabbed a seat at the bar within 30 minutes!

This is what we ordered:<br><br>Miso Hungry = If a croissant had a baby with a brioche and somehow formed itself like a cheesy popover, you could almost get to the Miso Hungry Bread. It was buttery, warm and delicious. I would buy this in a bakery if I could. The bread is served with a miso butter and kimchi relish.<br><br>Kohlrabi Salad = Sort of a less memorable, filler dish. My friend wanted salad so I said sure. It was well dressed and fresh but hardly something I'd order again. I will give credit though for the addition of blueberries which was a fun twist.<br><br>Goat Belly and Lobster = Imagine tender braised goat with the indulgent bit of fat like what you would get with pork belly. Then imagine it's sitting alongside poached lobster. This is like an odd spin on surf and turf but right in every other way. The sauce was rich and buttery with hints of vanilla. Delicious and unique. <br><br>Pork Shank = If you're here and you can only eat one dish. I'd get the pork shank. It's a meal in itself (you could probably do fine just ordering 2 other dishes along with this one). It's an enormous braised, tender, falling-apart pork shank served with all the fixings like house-made flat bread, sauces, and grilled vegetables.

We took advantage of that and ordered practically one dish off each section of the menu. <br><br>1. We started with the Herbs of Feta. Fresh bread with hummus and feta oil dip, what a great combination! You can taste the herbs on the bread, and the crunch on the crust of the bread was delicious. I couldn't get enough of the hummus, almost spooned it all onto my plate. <br><br>2. Now, I'm not a huge fan of oysters, especially raw but why not just try it in a different way? Fried, you say? Yum, yum! Fried Naked Cowboys was recommended by our waiter and wow! He wasn't wrong. A spoonful of bite sized oysters with egg salad on top, it was just marvelous. Who doesn't liked fried stuff? I would definitely want this again. <br><br>3. Favorite dish of the night, Chickpea Fritter! Love the crispy outer layer and then when you bite into it, you get a soft filling of chickpea in the inside. Love the bite with all the other garnishes and vegetables in this dish. Beyond amazing. <br><br>4. So other seafood options were pretty typical choices, so we decided to try something new, Pan Roasted Monkfish. It had a great sear to it. Wasn't my favorite, but nonetheless, still really good. <br><br>5. Seem like the Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face was a favorite by many reviewers, so it was a must try. As soon as it came out, you could smell the meat. It was topped off with a sunny side egg. There was a mix of fatty parts and tender meat. Make sure to break the yolk on top of the meat so it spreads around the meat, definitely was a good way to eat it!<br><br>6. At this point, my sister and I already had a loadful, but that didn't stop us from finishing the rest of our order, which was the Confit Goat Belly. The goat was oh so savory, but it was the lobster and crab with the bourbon butter that made the dish. The perfect representation of a surf and turf. <br><br>All the flavors in my mouth was craving for something light and sweet by the end of it, so we ended with a fruity dessert. <br><br>7. The Citrus Pavlova, yum yum! Ice cream served with a mix of blood orange, yuzu curd, kumquats, and a vanilla meringue. I couldn't get enough of this. It was absolutely scrumptious. The delightful taste of ice cream paired with fruits. My type of dessert!<br><br>8. Now, because it was my birthday, I received a sampler of the Miso-Butterscotch Budino. What a gift! The taste of bacon toffee with glazed pineapple?! The combination of sweet and salty. My favorite topping of it all, was the candied cashews. Perfect end to a perfect birthday dinner!<br><br>Now, it's no surprise that the food was great, but the service was just as wonderful! I'm not a huge fan of crowded restaurants, but I didn't mind it here. We were cared for very well. Waiters had great timing in switching out our plates, bringing water to the table, giving recommendations, and making sure we were enjoying our meal. To keep this in memory, my sister and I bought their T-shirts. \"When goats Fly\"<br><br>Definitely have to go back to Chicago to make a stop here again, an unforgettable dinner experience!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PqpScd2gjVGTZF3RnpyYGg/348s.jpg", "caption": "Miso-Butterscotch Budino"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ShjEnQjKtrekxR_Ar1qXLQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Citrus Pavlova"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tXnoFa0l4RHXY7CtC3mHSg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Confit Goat Belly"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Our 1045pm dinner had to be the best 24hr layover dinner in the history of layovers Â The staff blessed us with 2 of the only 4 counter seats, and we had a culinary blast. <br><br>Eating out is definitely about the whole experience beyond the food these days.

The other dishes, which I honestly can't remember much, were solid, but nothing too special - it's possible we didn't order the best dishes though. <br><br>Chickpea fritters were stir fried with a few other veggies and looked a lot like cubes of fried tofu. The outsides were perfectly crisp and the insides had a smooth texture similar to mashed potatoes. It's really important to get an even mix of all the ingredients in each bit. I really liked the touch of bean sprouts and the full chickpeas. Overall, the flavors and textures in the dishes were well thought out and paired. <br><br>My favorite was dessert. The budino was similar to a bread pudding with many more textures. In each bite you had spongy cake, glazed pineapple, creamy pudding, crunchy toffee pieces and finally some fresh cream. Uh... how does that not seem amazing?! I didn't really notice the miso taste anywhere, but the dish was fabulous. <br><br>While we didn't have anything to complain about with our food, our server did offer complimentary dishes to the tables next to us.

I'd prefer it dressed a more traditional way (shaved parmesan, balsamic, and arugula to freshen it up). I understand this place is ~avant grade dining but this wasn't executed well and the flavors weren't balanced in such a delicate dish. <br><br>I also had the octopus with brussels sprouts, which was surprisingly my least favorite dish of the night...So. Salty. I could only have a few bites because it was like they felt sympathy for the poor octopus being ripped from his oceanic home and decided to make his resting place equally as salty as the sea. Or tried to drown him in sea salt to make him feel at home in my bowl. Poor thing.<br><br>The Pig face was undeniably fat, melted in my mouth and was so delicious! But again, a bit too salty. The flavors in the pork were amazing but the dressings (crispy potato hash) made an already fatty dish even heavier and I wish there was one element to lighten/freshen it up.<br><br>Service was good, and the ambiance was lovely. But if I'm ever back in Chicago, I'd pass.<br><br>Quick tip: If you don't have a large party (1-3 people) don't bother making reservations.

Totally solid time for dinner, which explains my bad appetite throughout the entire meal. <br>My friend (a girl) and I got 4 dishes of meat and a dessert.

Gives really good suggestion for what's on the menu.<br><br>~Food~<br>1. Calamari Bruschetta (5/5)<br>Clam baguette. Goat milk ricotta. Goat bacon. Green tomato<br>God this is one of the best cooked calamari dish i've ever eaten. Juicy and chewy. Even though it keeps falling off from the bread but the creativity that goes into this dish is just so awesome. <br><br>2. Crispy Beef Short Ribs (4.5/5)<br>Avocado. Ruby red grapefruit chermoula<br>Solid short ribs. Easily pulled apart. Enjoyed the avocado which reminds me of home. The radish and sourness of this dish perfectly balanced the heaviness from the short ribs.<br><br>3. Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face (4/5)<br>Sunny side egg. Tamarind. Cilantro. Red wine-maple. Potato six<br>The meat was crispy and dotted with pieces of fat. I really like the flavor of the pig face and how they tried to lighten it with the egg. This dish is like a hidden treasure, you'll have to unmask the egg to see what's underneath. Interesting plating. The combination of green and brown sauce made me lose my appetite for this dish. Really enjoyed the potato stix that came with it.<br><br>4. Goat Neck (4.5/5) *seasonal*<br>This is a very very heavy meat dish. It's easily pulled part, but because it came at the end, it's just too much for me to finish and rage about it (after 3 meat dishes lol). Good first impression but couldn't finish coz i've had too much. Reminded me of lamb shank.<br><br>5. A blood orange surprise (3/5)<br>I didn't like the citrus cake that covered the surprise (blood orange sorbet) in side of it. It's not moist enough for my taste. The entire dessert leans toward sour, which is not my favorite flavor but it sort of lightens me up after all that meat i've eaten. Beautiful plating though.<br><br>---------------------------------------<br>I came here again with another friend. Here are some of the other dishes we ordered:<br><br>Roasted cauliflower (5/5):<br>I don't even like cauliflower, ok? But this is so good. The cauliflower is buttery. Topped with pine nuts and mint, it gives the dish an earthy feeling with hints of pleasure and spikes. <br><br>Grilled shrimp (4.5/5):<br>I'm somewhat allergic to the shell of shrimp. My friend who doesn't even like shrimp LOVED this dish. We both did. It's topped with lots of veggies and kumquats. Very flavorful. The shrimp was fresh and crisp. <br><br>Dark matter pot de creme (5/5):<br>I didn't like the dessert last time. <br>I loved this one. <br>It's mysterious but also beautiful. <br>Topped with ginger caramel and sesame (one of my favorite flavor) foam, you have to scoop to the bottom of the cup and uncover the treasure. The combination of sesame, coffee, and ginger caramel was so heavenly. This is a chilled dessert and definitely lightens the entire meal with additional flavor combinations.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Uo_sExDow_1Dt5PTi7TYOA/348s.jpg", "caption": "Dark matter pot de creme"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KE4yCOXZhrLZfz7JJxWHbg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Pig face"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BSdlBTX2dxuPqf85z97fpQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Grilled shrimp"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Stephanie Izard is insanely talented!

Girl and the Goat came up as a must try place recommended by locals as well as good ol Yelp. I had a hard time getting to the place, and for a Wednesday night, the only reservation I could get in was at 1030pm. A scant half hour before closing. I couldn't wait for it to be my sole dinner since it was late so it was actually more of late night snack. I had come very close to abandoning such a luxurious practice as eating 4 meals a day. Also it was Â quite far from my hotel, but in the end, Girl and the Goat did not disappoint and it became one of my favorite experiences in Chicago, food or otherwise! <br><br>First things first, the staff was very informative, helpful and cheery, I really did feel welcome as my waitress answered my inquiries of what her favorites were as well as on a side note, what else Chicago had to offer. The atmosphere is your typical retro wire coil bulb yellow light wood and iron stylish throwback. Bustling with customers it's a lively place with lots going on. Fine for a date, but be prepared to speak up.<br><br>Finally, the food! It should come as no surprise but a place like this is supposed to be a venue for food to be bold, creative and experimental. Small, artful dishes meant to be shared is the motif so savor those bites in between the conversation or just close your eyes and enhance those taste buds like I did. Some dishes can be made as Â half portion as my waitress so kindly marked on the menu for me. Still, even the half dishes may be enough to get a taste if you're with someone so you can try more variety. Ask!<br><br>Onto the specific dishes I ordered: Escargot dumplings, Wood fired Eagle Rock Oysters, Goat Belly Confit, and finally a dessert (I know, quite the anomaly for yours truly) of the dark matter pot de creme. Â The oysters and dumplings came first. The oysters were wood fired, so in between the fried and raw options but nicely done. Served with horseradish, bacon and preserved lemon. Pretty good, though the horseradish could've had just a little more kick, the bacon was perfectly diced to flavor as well as add to the texture of the dish. Escargot dumplings were served with a bacon tamarind sauce with celery, escarole and crispy onions. Dumpling was properly cooked and the sauce was inventive, if a little on the salty side. I found it best when soaked into the crispy onions and greens and applied to a bite of the dumpling. If it had just stopped at these two dishes I think this place wouldn't have quite gotten a 5 rating from me. Quite good and interesting but it was the next dish that really pushed it into the 5 rating range.<br><br>I cannot say enough good things about the Goat belly confit. I knew it was going to be an over the top rich dish...bourbon butter? Crab AND lobster? With the fennel covering it it didn't look that heavy but make no mistake, this one will coat your taste buds. Of course, in a wonderfully decadent way...My first bite included a little bit of everything and what I noticed first was the fragrance of the bourbon butter. Food entices all the senses... some more than others but smell is usually a precursor, a tease before taste and texture. This time it unexpectedly stowed away with those two but it turned out to be a welcome guest! I instinctively closed my eyes to enjoy it. If i had been in a conversation with a date, I would have asked for some silence to appreciate it! <br><br>After that piece de la resistance I decided that since I was here I might as well try dessert. The dark matter pot de creme looked like your typical pot de creme but I just can't resist things with sesame. It also had some ginger which if used subtly and is just divine. It was on the same level as the first two dishes very good....if not just needed a little refinement for my taste. The sesame brittle pieces could've been slightly smaller and the ginger could've been toned down just a little. <br><br>In the end, one of my most memorable eating experiences. It gets the coveted 5 stars not only based on the food which is strong for sure, but on inventiveness and great service. I'm coming back next time I'm in Chicago for sure. There's lots more to try!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/m0oAueeczdCTQ_EMRTEqdw/348s.jpg", "caption": "Fire Cooked Oyster with horseradish and bacon"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-d8CTxQfC8UYXb4haM8a7A/168s.jpg", "caption": "Escargot Dumplings with Bacon Tamarind Sauce"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OHPGaq9jOjLRq_3VKY_HWg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Goat Belly Confit with Crab, Lobster and Bourbon Butter"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "This was the best meal I ate during my 5 day stay in Chicago!

We had a reservation for 8:30 on a Friday, which was made a month in advance. We waited between the bar and hostess stand for about fifteen minutes for our table to open up. It was very busy, so we felt a little bit awkward and in the way as servers walked by with trays of food. The hostess who seated us identified us and said, \"Hi, David, your table is ready,\" which was a nice touch. We came hungry and were ready to begin our meal! <br><br>We waited for maybe ~five more minutes before our water glasses were filled and our server arrived. Our server recommended we order 2-3 dishes each. We decided to forego drinks in lieu of ordering more food (we love to eat!). We ordered six dishes at once and then the kitchen decided which courses should be brought out in what order/combination. <br><br>Roasted cauliflower. I've had this veggie menu item in the back of my head for years after reading a delicious description by Candice G., our former Yelp Chicago 'burbs CM. The dish definitely lived up to my expectations! The pickled peppers definitely gave the dish a bit of a kick, but I still consumed it easily (and I'm a heat-averse person). The mint and pine nuts also worked really well with the big chunks of cauliflower. <br><br>Chickpea fritters. My boyfriend remarked that the fritters were basically like \"fried hummus\" and he meant that in the best possible way. The fritters were like eating clouds--so smooth and light! The yogurt, garam masala, rosemary, and green mango worked magnificently. I would definitely order this dish again. <br><br>Grilled baby octopus. This was a great dish, but by the time it arrived, I was already almost full from half of the previous two dishes! We got most of it to-go so we could still at least sample the rest of our meal. My only complaint about this dish was that the octopus was a little chewier than I prefer and it was a little overly-salty. Still a great dish, though! I thought there was a pretty liberal amount of octopus (other reviews complained about there not being enough).<br><br>Sauteed green beans. My boyfriend was underwhelmed by this dish and we agreed it could have used more cashews. The fish sauce wasn't fishy at all, which was excellent. Even though it was slightly saltier than I prefer, it was still the best green bean dish I've ever had. We took most of this home for leftovers!<br><br>Ham frites. The fries were pretty standard in the best way--fairly skinny and not overly crispy or oily. They were covered in what reminded me of a cross between a bacon crumble and fine dust. The ham dust liberally topped the fries and the tomato aioli plus cheddar beer dipping sauces were exquisite. They were very rich. <br><br>Wood oven-roasted pig face. This signature G&G dish was a must, so I tried a bite even though I don't eat meat! The sunny-side egg was cooked to absolute perfection. My boyfriend remarked that it was really fatty, which could be interpreted as \"either the best thing in the world or the worst thing in the world.\" It was really, really tasty. The cilantro and red wine-maple were smeared decoratively on the plate.<br><br>Miso-butterscotch budino. We were absolutely stuffed by this point, but there was no way we were leaving without trying a G&G dessert. We went with this dessert on the recommendation from our waitress and we didn't know what to expect. (What is a budino?) I still can't really explain it, but it was really great. You can't go wrong with candied cashews! <br><br>Overall, this was a really fantastic experience. Some of these bites were simply magical! My only complaint was that there was too much food. Three dishes per person is DEFINITELY way too much. I recommend ordering four dishes total for two people, plus dessert; that would be the sweet spot. Portions are pretty generous. I felt like we got great value for the food + cost. Customer service felt a little off originally because no one acknowledged or apologized for our table being 15 minutes late past the reservation.

While probably my least favorite of the bunch because I'm not a huge fan of lobster, my bf took one for the team and just so generously ate the majority of this dish. The lobster was sweet and buttery and the goat was on par.<br><br>Crisp braised pork shank (buttermilk dressing. grilled spring onion kimchee. naan) - wow. just wow. so much meat that falls off the bone. I made little pizzas out of mine. I layered my naan with the buttermilk dressing, the kimchee, and topped it off with some pork.

Â She makes food art because that's how your dishes look when it comes out; a masterpiece.<br><br>I was fortunate enough to dine here twice in the dining room (once with a reservation that I had made 3 months in advance, and the 2nd a party had cancelled freeing up a table in the back where you have the few view of the kitchen). Â Both times I walked out with a giant smile on my face, and with a food baby. Â Foodies, you know what I mean when I say food baby.<br><br>My personal favorites here are the following:<br>Roasted Cauliflower<br>Wood Fired Striped Bass<br>Pig Face<br>Goat Empanadas<br>Bread (pick one.. any one and it's going to be delicious)<br><br>So let's break down flavor profiles of said favorite dishes.<br><br>V for Vegetable<br>If Chef Stephanie tried to feed me this as a child, I might have started loving vegetables earlier in life. Â The mint and pine nuts in the cauliflower really brings out a savory quality of this dish. Â The mint brightens the dish where the pine nuts brings an earthy quality to the dish. Â The pine nuts also gives a different crunch to the dish. Â The reviews that came before mine are all true! Â This is a dish you must have!<br><br>F is for Fish<br>Don't like the goat liver throw you off. Â Whatever pre-conceived notion you have about liver, take that idea.. ball it up.. and throw it away. Â Just toss it out! Â The sweet, sweet bass with the creamy liver aioli is a match made in heaven. Â And the mushroom mole gives this typically light flavored fish an edge. Â Chef Stephanie brought a new meaning to surf and turf in this plate.<br><br>M is for Meat<br>Bacon.. sayonara! Â Step out of that comfort zone and get the Pig Face. Â The pig face is melt in your mouth goodness! Â One bite and you'll realize that this is the best cut of pork. Â Fatty, buttery goodness! Â <br><br>Goat Empanadas are topped with grilled mushroom giardiniera and I cannot get enough of it! Â This is the perfect dish to break the ice for your friends who are a little antsy around new food. Â As another Chef had once said, \"If it looks good, eat it!\" Â  (-Andrew Zimmern) Â Here's the thing.. Goat meat is a more tender meat that almost has the consistancy of a slow cooked brisket with a milder taste than beef. Â They won't be able to tell that its goat.. they'll think its beef. Â Then you can drop the bomb that they tried something new! Â Help broaden their taste palate! Â <br><br>And lastly... the bread. Â Omg! Â The fresh bread is to die for. Â The bread menu changes which makes it exciting! Â I had the Apple Bread (forgot the exact name), the Jack-o-Lantern, and the Green Bean Casserole. Â If I could.. I could've eaten all 3 bread rolls in one sitting but I guess that's frowned upon.<br><br>Try to save room for dessert. Â The Miso Butterscotch Budino is my favorite of the 4. Â Its really hard because the PB&J was a close 2nd. Â The crunchy brittle with the soft butterscotch budino... Yummo! Â Its a little denser than pudding and the best culinary creation ever! Â <br><br>The best part of my time here, was that I saw Chef Stephanie! Â And she took a picture with us!!!! #geeked #celebsighting #bestnightever<br><br>Yes, i am done with my novel.

I Googled her mid-meal and I think she was working the night we were there, which means this is a good representation of how things should be/taste on a good night. While I might seem like a rookie to eating good food, the truth is I've been in China for the past five years and I seem to have missed the memo about why this restaurant is so special (it's the goat, right?). I try to identify the most highly rated, semi-affordable places (this is why I didn't go to Alinea) in the cities I plan to visit whenever I come back to the States and this place kept popping up, so I decided to give it a shot. <br><br>Our reservation was for 5:30 pm and when we arrived, the restaurant was already packed. We were squeezed into a two-person table with couples on both sides of us, less than an arm's length away. We could hear both couples' conversations clearly and it was super awkward. My wife and I tried to rationalize the lack of space and stifling noise by repeatedly stating that this was a popular, trendy restaurant and we were just lucky to have gotten reservations earlier than 9:30 pm.<br><br>My wife wasn't very hungry, but I had already walked like 20,000 steps, so I was starving. We got four dishes: softshell crab, cauliflower, pork shank, and goat empanadas plus the brioche, mainly because it was cheap and had decent reviews. <br><br>It was a reasonable amount of food, but I still got gelato at Eataly afterward.<br><br>The brioche came first. It was warm and fluffy, and the butter/jam combination was interesting. Definitely worth the $5 we paid for it. The goat empanadas came next. The goat was less distinctively \"goaty\" than I would have liked (tasted like carnitas), but the combination of avocado, cheese, and fruit salsa made this an excellent dish nonetheless. The softshell crab was fine, but not spectacular or unique. I love softshell crab more than most things in this world, but I wouldn't order this dish again...I'd probably try the calamari bruschetta for a fish dish instead. The cauliflower looked great when it arrived, but the excess amount of cheese made the dish way too salty and covered up the subtly sweet taste that roasting and caramelization brings out in cauliflower. I make better cauliflower at home. We didn't finish the dish. The pork shank was great, but I don't think I've ever had a pork shank that wasn't great; it's a meat that's difficult to mess up due to its high fat content, kind of like a chicken thigh. The buffalo sauce was fine (I would have liked it spicier, but my wife would not), as was the buttermilk dressing. The grilled onion/radish \"kimchi\" was not kimchi and did nothing for the dish, but I appreciated the extra greens to help with digestion. The naan was charred and chewy, as it should be. There could have been more though. <br><br>Overall, this place was decent, but I'm not sure it is worthy of its epic status on Yelp. Also, at $50 per person including tip, I don't think the dishes justify the prices. None of the dishes we ordered included any super premium ingredients (e.g., foie, truffles, caviar, lobster, uni) and they were all pretty small plates. While we were full by the end of the meal, it was mostly because of all the bread, cheese, and fatty pork we ate. The service was fine, but I saw a review that compared it to a three star Michelin restaurant, and it DEFINITELY was not that good. The waitress came to take our order almost 15 minutes after we received menus. <br><br>I guess this is a good restaurant to take an out-of-town foodie friend or a large group of yuppies and/or hipsters, but I wouldn't bring my mother (like the person next to us) or someone with whom I wanted to have a meaningful conversation. <br><br>I honestly think a lot of the 5-star reviews are due to \"group think\" and people tend to give it an extra star because they FINALLY got a chance to eat here (usually for their birthdays) after months or years of anticipation. If this restaurant was started by some smelly no-name dude with a gut and an off-putting personality and you came on a random weeknight after a long day of work, things would probably be different. <br><br>But yeah, this place is fine.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "If you've never had Bestia in Downtown Los Angeles, then Girl & the Goat may come off as a one of the most adventurous journeys you've ever taken your taste buds on...HOWEVER...since I've already experienced the orgasmic, mind blowing, thriller that is Bestia--the Girl & the Goat was simply...alright. <br><br>Food wise, like Bestia--tapas style--using a mix of eclectic modern ingredients to spice up Â relatively familiar tapas...except everything at Girl and the Goat was 10x saltier than it should have been.<br><br>The grilled baby octopus was very soft and tender--but super salty.<br>String beans w/ anchovy sauce---crisp and fresh--but super salty.<br>Beef Tongue--mediocre at most--but super salty.<br>The best was probably the pork face--had a very comforting creamy taste, probably thanks to the egg yolk. --okay salty...<br>Raw oysters were good and fresh.<br><br>Service is excellent. <br><br>I had a few other things there but I suppose it was not as memorable as I'd like--but the hype definitely did not meet my expectations.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Get the pig face, the roasted cauliflower and some bread! The food was SO good, even better than I expected-- I've hoped to go to the Girl and the Goat ever since Stephanie opened it, since I'm a massive Top Chef fan--but the service was just ok. <br><br>We knew it would be difficult to get in without a reservation, so since we had a more flexible schedule, we set our goal at getting there early. We arrived at about 4:10 on a Friday and there was nobody waiting, so we got to put our names down first. We were told we could be seated right at 4:30 but would have to leave by 6, which was fine, since we had a flight to catch. <br><br>We were seated facing the kitchen (awesome!) at a big table that could fit about 8 people, but then about 10 minutes later, two people were seated in the seats facing us (weird!). I'm not sure why they do that, but I still liked watching the cooks work. We saw Stephanie Izard in the kitchen! She was super hands-on, both cooking and expediting. I was too chicken to ask for a picture, haha. <br><br>We started with the jack-o-lantern bread ($4), which was super soft (though with a lovely crust) and cheesy pumpkin bread served with brown butter butter. I could have just eaten that for dinner and been thrilled, honestly. They bake it across the street at the Little Goat Diner and it came out really warm. Then we got the beet salad ($9), which was probably the least exciting thing of the night, but it was still good. The wild striped bass was so surprising and delicious-- I didn't know how the mushroom mole and smoked clams would really work with it, but it was such a great combination. The fish was perfectly cooked-- it was soft but had great crisp skin. <br><br>Then came two of my favorites: the roasted cauliflower ($10 I think) and the pig face ($15 I think). I wish I could make my cauliflower so well at home! The pine nuts, parmesan, pickled peppers and mint (which was unexpected) really brought the whole dish together. Our waitress encouraged us to turn the pig face into a hash with tiny crispy potato strips and a fried egg. The whole mess was really crunchy and fatty and fantastic-- GET IT! <br><br>The goat loin ($22) was good since it wasn't too goat-y. I didn't know you could cook goat medium, but it was basically like a steak. It came with a autumn squash mix and \"goat xo sauce,\" which was mysterious but tasty. However, I couldn't stop thinking about the previous two dishes, which were definitely my favorites! <br><br>The portion sizes are really reasonable for a small plates place. With the five dishes (plus bread) that we got, we were stuffed. <br><br>Finally, some complaints about the service: The waitress took a long time to take our orders (I think it was around 4:50 when she finally did, and since they wanted us out quickly, I felt like she should have moved things along). This is probably kind of nitpicky, but I didn't like that she said she was there to \"hang out with us\" that evening. I'm all for casual, but I feel like that's just kind of weird! Also, though she told us to trust her with the food pacing, the first couple came out pretty quickly, then there was a long gap before we got the pig and the goat. <br><br>I hope to visit again with a reservation-- I'd love to sit at one of the seats right next to the expediting station, where you can watch everything in the kitchen super closely.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/J57v4ziomWo_CoI1n0GWnA/348s.jpg", "caption": "such a cute goat"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0AAkPG__EizmbI1keTjNWw/168s.jpg", "caption": "stephanie in the kitchen!"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IJVenb_lsBXQdATwfWj-2A/168s.jpg", "caption": "beet salad and YUMMY jack-o-lantern bread"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Definitely make reservations in advance!!

The scallops were cooked perfectly. Had a great flavor too. <br><br>Wood oven roasted PIG FACE with sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine maple, & potato stix.

Don't be afraid to try this one! <br><br>CONFIT GOAT BELLY w/ bourbon butter, lobster n crab, & fennel. This was my least favorite dish of the night. It wasn't horrible but I didn't want any more after the first bite. I'd say pass on this one. <br><br>Overall, most of the dishes were good but not amazing. I really liked the space though.

He stopped by every 2-3 minutes to annoy us and ask if we were ready to order. Finally we said, \"it's not even 5:45pm yet, we are waiting for our fourth person.\" He went away and sure enough 2-3 minutes later came back and sarcastically said \"We have another reservation for this particular table at 7:30pm, the hostess didn't know you all weren't here.\" I said, \"The hostess never asked, and again it's NOT even 5:45pm yet!\" So at that point he could tell we were all irritated.

Must get!! <br><br>Wood oven roasted pig face: this was a great dish as well. You breakdown and mix everything together and the yolk just brings all the flavors together with the pork. <br><br>Crisp braised pork shank: this dish is a very good portion. With a table of 4 we were all able to get a good portion of the fall-off-the-bone pork and the awesome sauces they paired it with. <br><br>Goat belly confit: awesome dish!

I just feel that it's over cooked and salted. I can't recommend this one.<br><br>Confit Goat Belly (Bourbon butter, lobster, crab, and fennel): It was decadent, dreamy, and savory.

(When reviewing the menu, I had mentioned to him how much I loved duck tongue but had decided on the kimchee duck.) I was confused and he said that he could tell I didn't like the dish. WHOA. THAT is service, folks. Really. I don't think I've ever had that kind of service. <br><br>10 seconds later, the crispy duck tongue arrives and the other dish is swept away. The duck tongue was surprisingly amazing. The small tongues were deep-fried but still soft and chewy. The beans in the dish made me pause but wow, did it work flavor-wise. In between chuckles, I happily gobbled it down. <br><br>On my second beer, I looked at the clock and noticed that I was running a little behind to see the Eddie Izzard show, so I missed out on the dessert that was graciously offered to me boo! It had bacon in it, which I don't eat, but the dessert did have the magical words 'bread pudding.' I bet it's flocking amazing.

There are over 5K pics and the menu is tiny--I'm just adding to the noise and I know it. But add I must. <br><br>The idea of the \"unexpected\" keeps coming back to me as I think about my experience with this place.<br><br>The food here was such a delicate and thoughtful surprise. Why isn't there a progressive goat-focused restaurant in every city? Chef has taken a humble (albeit delicious) protein and added a shocking lightness to it. Without reading any reviews I felt trust that this Top Chef winner would deliver something thing tasty. I was not prepared to see goat a whole new way.<br><br>The dishes all had a clean, light, crispness to them. Particularly the goat shank and the broccoli. There is some recognizable spice in the broth the shank was sitting in that speaks to something primal in me. The empanadas and ham frites (sigh--I cannot believe I ate ham anything) were solid and I liked them. Again, while not on a \"best of\" list, but in keeping with the theme, both were unexpected--I don't think the \"ham salt\" sold me, but conceptually, I appreciated how it built on an idea. <br><br>Can we talk about the short rib? I had not been eating animal protein and decided to eat some at G&G. Â That short rib dish (and that shank) made it worth my while. The light, crispy, and dare I say....buttery pieces of meat were perfectly seasoned and tender and delectable. I'll skip the calamari next time and simply get two orders of the short rib.<br><br>Chef is rethinking food and how we interact with it at this place. Goat is a humble and common protein eaten all around the world. Yet in America it is an unusual ingredient to see on a menu. So often we see an ingredient as belonging to a certain people or region or cuisine. Â All around me people were falling in love with their dishes. Which says that folks are ready to try something \"new\" and connect with it. <br><br>And when I thought I had had my fill, I had the goat cheese cheesecake. I don't care too much for desert--just not my thing---but this hit all my taste points. Hands down this is my favorite dessert. From anywhere. I hate to admit I miss that salty, creamy caramel with the tart goat cheese cheesecake sitting atop a Â pretzel crust. I'm embarrassed that I enjoyed his so much. I'm so glad I don't live in his city b/c if I did, I'd be coming here too often. And eating desert every time.<br><br>The ingredient -goat--suggests something heavy and filling and complete. But each bite moves your mind to a new and unexpected place. Even the building is a surprise. It is dark and fairly unmarked. But the moment you step inside it is bursting and alive and warm. Like the food being cooked in the kitchen, it plays on and subverts our expectations to revel itself as something altogether different. <br><br>I appreciate the balance and I cannot wait to go back.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "My boyfriend and I went here for his birthday after reserving a table over a month in advance and it was well worth the wait.

Neither of us are big fans of oysters and were hesitant about these, but these were tasty and there was no visible fishy taste to them. <br><br>Bread- We got the Johnny Applecheese, which comes with apple butter and chili cheddar butter. Both spreads were delicious and the bread was warm and soft, which made it perfect as a filling appetizer. <br><br>Small Plates: Here's where we went a little wrong- we ordered many small plates as our waitress told us that it would be enough food. However, we quickly realized we had ordered too much as the plates come out when they're made. <br><br>Pierogies- This was the dish my boyfriend and I decided we both liked the least. It is a strange combination of flavors, but the sweet potato filling made the pierogies too sweet for both of our tastes. The mushrooms that came with it were delicious. <br><br>Wood fired shrimp- This is by far our favorite and we would return just for the shrimp. The amount of seasoning is perfect and the shrimp are cooked very well- not too chewy and a good texture. <br><br>Goat Satay- This plate came out last for us, so we were very full at this point. We had both never had goat, but it was quite tasty and not tough. It was seasoned well and not overly salty, which both of us appreciated. <br><br>Calamari Bruschetta- The calamari were cooked wonderfully in this dish- not too chewy but not raw. There is not a visible fishy taste on the calamari and both of us -who usually don't like calmari- greatly enjoyed this. There is a lot of bread and it is a little bit of a messy dish. <br><br>Dessert: <br><br>We got a small portion of the caramel corn and malt balls for free for my boyfriend's birthday. Neither of us are huge fans of popcorn but it tasted quite good. We liked the combination of the hard shell chocolate with the soft ice cream as well as the caramel corn. <br><br>We also got the dark matter pot de creme. It was a unique variety of flavors due to the chocolate mousse, sesame bark, and salted caramel. The caramel was very salty, so if you like sweeter caramel, this is not the dessert for you. The strangest part was the sesame flavor as that is not typically imagined as a dessert ingredient. At this point, I think both of us were about to burst so we only split a few bites of the huge cup. <br><br>Overall, we greatly enjoyed the meal and left very full.

As a party of one with limited stomach real estate, I would have to choose carefully! At the restaurant, I discovered that many dishes could be halved - half the quantity for half the price - which made my work a little easier.

While there is actually (raw?) tuna in the dish, my waiter confirmed the fried things are indeed duck tongues! The tongues are warm and tender, and when you bite into them the texture is strangely like ... the feeling of a tongue ... and it is probably the closest you will ever come to making out with a duck. I also felt the broccoli was a highlight. The light char and cheesy sauce make this simple dish special.<br><br>The empanadas and tiramisu were good but not nearly as unique.<br><br>The server brought a second dessert \"on the house\" - I observed this happening again a few tables down, and have read about it happening to others here, so it must happen fairly regularly.

The \"bonus\" dessert was nice, but I hadn't budgeted the stomach real estate for it, so I was not able to finish.<br><br>I can't think of any way the service or food could have been better, and I felt the price was fair.

One I've never even heard of Kohlrabi, but apparently it's a type of radish. I found the dish to be refreshing and full of flavor. You can taste each ingredient on its own as the dressing is not over powering and when you take each piece into one bite, it creates this wonderful taste. I can't even explain it, but I've never tasted anything like it before. All I can say it was a good way to start the meal. Â <br><br>Next we had the Pan Roasted Drum Fish with autumn crisp apples, szechuan vinaigrette and vanilla bean-herb yogurt. The fish was cooked perfectly, soft on the inside, but crispy on the outside. This dish was also bursting with flavors, one moment it was sweet (vanilla bean yogurt), next it was tangy (szechuan vinaigrette). <br><br>Then we had the wood oven roasted Pig Face everyone talks about. Included with the pig was a sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine-maple and potato stix. They advise you mix it all together. The meat was soft and fatty, but when you eat it with the potato six it was crunchy. Â <br>Another dish which was unlike any other with the various ingredients. <br><br>For dessert we ordered the one with peanut butter gelato covered in the chocolate magic shell and there were bits of chocolate cake. It was crunchy, soft sweet and nutty all in one. We also ordered the donut holes that were on top of an apple granita. The donut was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Eating the donut with the cream and apple granita, was like eating a deconstructed apple pie with a glass a milk. It tasted absolutely amazing.<br><br>They recommend two main plates a person, but I enjoy how we shared 3 main dishes and 2 desserts.

Â Nuoc cham is a Vietnamese dipping sauce and S.I. put a spin on it by adding blueberries. Â Mind blown! Â It didn't really taste like authentic nuoc cham, Â which is good because I know a lot of westerners who are not big fans of fish sauce. Â The sauce was tart with hints of sweetness from the brown sugar and occasional burst of sweetness from the blueberries. Â The sauce married perfectly with the slightly salty pan seared to perfection halibut. <br><br>I was stoked to order the pigs face. Â All the reviews raved about this pigs face. Â I thought Â the flavors were amazing but it was personally too fatty. Â First, pop that little thought bubble of a pig's head on your dinner table. Â The pig's face was a circular disk with a diameter of approximately 3 inches. Â Now imagine 1/2 an inch running down the center, that was the portion with meat, everything else was fat.

Â It had hints of spiciness from the pepper which was neutralized with the hints of mint. Â Sooo Yum.<br><br>Kalbi veal chops with strawberry tapenade. Â This is a Korean influenced dish that I could have done without. Â This says a lot because I absolutely love Korean BBQ. Â I thought the sweetness from the kalbi marinade combined with the sweetness of the tapenade was a bit much.

Goat loin (5/5) - Seriously... WHO makes goat THIS great!? Â Tasted like a well-aged filet mignon.<br><br>3. Pan roasted halibut (5/5) - Thinly crusted on the outside, incredibly juicy on the inside, with a hint of sweetness.<br><br>4. Seared duck breast (4/5) - Duck tends to be fatty, but nope, not this one. Â Very tender, much like the goat loin. Â <br><br>5. Ham frites (4/5) - Never thought of fries as gourmet food, but the cheddar beer sauce builds a strong case.<br><br>The only \"half star\" deduction I would give is that the portions are a little on the small side for my taste.

As a lover of unique dining experiences and fan Stephanie Izard, I knew this would be right up my alley. But, let me tell you - getting reservations is a chore! I scoured Open Table for weeks, trying to snag a Friday or Saturday dinner reservation, as my M-Th schedule is too unpredictable. I didn't even care what time. (Hello, early birds?) Northing. Then, finally, I realized I could call the restaurant directly. I ended up having to schedule six weeks out, but at least I had something on the books.<br><br>When our reservation day finally arrived, we had high expectations. And the food and hospitality far exceeded anything we could have imagined! <br><br>The servers were knowledgeable, thoughtful, and downright skilled at their jobs. Our server knew every inch of that menu and did an excellent job anticipating our needs. <br><br>The food was great. The cocktails were great. (My husband said the beer was great.) The shared plate concept allowed us to try a variety of items, from goat empanadas to sweet corn pierogis to wood oven roast pig face (yes, pig face). But one of my favorite items was one that we almost skipped; do yourself a favor and order the \"Olive You.\" It is a warm bread with olives baked in, served with whipped feta and EVOO, and it was so delicious!<br><br>The downside: I can confirm that other reviewers' comments about the restaurant being loud and crowded is 100% correct. My husband actually commented that he was glad we knew each other already (as in, it wasn't a first date) because there was no way we were going to be able to have any conversation beyond a few phrases shouted across the table. Speaking of the tables, they were so close that each time the hostess seated a couple in our area, we watched her physically move the table out from the half-booth so the person sitting in the booth side could get to their seat. In fact, I could have easily rested my elbow on my neighbor's table.<br><br>But, does the food make up for the space/noise issues?

I was excited to try Stephanie Izard's restaurant after seeing her performance a few years ago on Top Chef.

The host was gracious and said we could wait at the bar and someone would come get us when a table was available. While waiting we tried the Thai One On, a lovely cocktail with rum, brandy, passion fruit-Thai chile syrup, and bitters. The drink was smooth and excellently crafted. It did taste more like a grapefruit infused drink rather than passion fruit though. We were also slightly disappointed that we couldn't taste more chile flavor in the drink. <br><br>When we were seated, our waitress explained that all the dishes are meant to be shared and medium size. For our party of 3 6-8 dishes would be a good amount to order. We ended up ordering 8 which left me pleasantly full but with no room for dessert. Our dishes were the raw oyster, goat empanada, squash blossom crab Rangoon, calamari bruschetta, divers scallops, pork face with fried egg, grilled Walter's chicken, and goat belly with lobster. My favorite dishes were the raw oyster, pork face, and the squash blossom. Each dish in general had a lovely presentation and had a kaleidoscope of colors pleasing to your eye. Overall I enjoyed my meal, but I did notice that the dishes got saltier as the night wore on. The goat belly and the chicken were probably the saltiest of all the dishes we ordered. Each dish ranged from the mid teens to low 20s. I think our most expensive dish was the chicken at $21.<br><br>The goat is really well executed here.

Water was refilled promptly, dishes taken away efficiently, and we were checked up on as needed. The timing of our dishes worked out well since the next dish would come near the end of us finishing our current dish. <br><br>The noise level of the restaurant itself was loud, partially due to the full seating of tables and the loud music playing on the speakers, so we had to shout a bit to each other to hear what we were saying.

When entering the restaurant, the first thing I noticed was how dark it was. Although the tables, floors, and roof were wood, the majority of the walls were painted an obsidian-like shade with the exception of a small area of exposed brick. I felt like we were spelunking as we traveled to our table near the back of the restaurant. Very trendy ambience!<br><br>Unfortunately, the tables in our area were pretty cramped. The table was scooted out before I could reach my bench seat, and I could easily participate in the conversations of the diners on either side of me. At one point, I felt like scooting our table one inch closer to the one next to us to see if they would be obligated to share food with us, but proper decorum stopped me. The menu is interestingly divided into veggie, fish, meat, and goat.<br><br>Shishito peppers - The seemingly small bowl packed a bunch of peppers and some surprising jolts of heat. The top layer was covered in parmesan cheese, but the peppers on lower levels had very little cheese. Most of the peppers were not spicy, but 4-5 of the smaller peppers were FIRE. I was not prepared for the spiciness, so it took a bit for my mouth to recover after a real hot one. Overall, this dish was super oily. The grease took away from the taste of the parmesan and added nothing to the deflated peppers.<br><br>Beef tongue - This was one of my favorite things. The quarter-sized pieces of beef were so soft and almost melted in my mouth. The masa chips and salsa verde were bomb. I wanted to lick the bottom of the bowl to get the last drops of the yummy salsa.<br><br>Szechuan goat satay - I grew up eating goat, but not like this. Medium cooked goat corny dogs on sprout-covered skewers atop creamy apple-potato puree. There was a lot going on with this dish. I could have done without the sprouts, they did not have enough bite to add anything texture-wise, but the goat was tasty and slightly sweet. The mashed potatoes were very buttery and smooth.<br><br>Pig face - Our server said this was world-famous, and I could see why. How often do I eat face? My first bite was all crisp, so I was not too excited, but delving deeper into the food, I discovered more and more elements. The pig face comes stuffed with potato stix, which I think are mini hash browns, and topped with a sunny -side up egg. This dish was very fatty and crunchy and sweet and crispy! There was a lot of flavor to the pork, and the fat surprisingly did not seem too greasy.<br><br>Bittersweet chocolate - This dessert was ordered after eyeing our neighboring table's plate. The majority of the dish is a cakey-brownie with a generous scoop of shitake-caramel gelato. I loved the gelato and really enjoyed the saltiness of it which enhanced the dish as a whole. There were different textures to our brownie, and I preferred the gooier parts. I was very pleased with the amount of dessert present and probably could not have finished the entire thing on my own, which I never thought could happen.<br><br>The service here was excellent and our served easily answered all of my pressing questions. Even though you must walk down a dark stairway to get to the bathroom, I liked how the bathroom stalls are completely isolated from one another.

Didn't go with anything else we ordered, but it was a fun start to our meal.<br>DUCK TONGUES with tuna and black bean poke, crispy wontons, piri piri: A dish suggested to us by our server, this was tasty with southwestern accents and plenty of textures. <br>ROASTED CAULIFLOWER with pickled peppers, pinenuts, and mint: This is what a vegetable dish should be! Fresh, crunchy, flavorful. I really enjoyed this. <br>GOAT EMPANADAS with smoked blueberry tapenade and avocado: The dish I was most looking forward to! Two small and delicate handpies, filled with shredded goat. The meat was on the dry side, but the flavor was meaty and complemented well by the fruit and avocado. Wish there was a third empanada for this $16 order.<br>CONFIT GOAT BELLY with bourbon butter, lobster n crab, and fennel: Underwhelming. The belly was a little overcooked and the flavor profile heavily favored the seafood rather than serving to highlight the goat. This was decent but not something I would necessarily get again.<br>PAN ROASTED HALIBUT with marcona almond butter, white asparagus, and blueberry nuoc cham: This is not the halibut dish Stephanie Izard won Top Chef with, as another review mentions. Halibut is a fish that is difficult to flavor, and though this dish was plated with a wonderful sauce, the portions of fish that were not submerged were dry and basic. I'm glad we got this dish but again, I'd try something else next time.<br>CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE CAKE: Chocolate with coconut accents makes this a fun dessert reminiscent of the flavors of an Almond Joy. The cake portion was on the small side, dwarfed by the large scoop of ice cream atop it, which was coated in a Magic-Shell-like splash of hardened chocolate. I liked that this dessert wasn't too sweet. <br><br>Service was attentive and friendly throughout, from the ever-present bussers and our designated server, who happily provided us several recommendations for dishes that aren't as often mentioned in reviews.

Some said it was too overwhelming and others said it was innovative. Some said good service and others said bad service. While still others said the food was way too salty. However, I have been wanting to try it since it opened and was very excited he chose to take me here for our anniversary. <br><br>The food: The food was amazing! I really have no complaints about how any of the food tasted. The chickpea fritter was my lease favorite and it was still really tasty. The chickpea fritters alone were nothing special. Great texture, but not too flavorful, however, when paired with the yogurt sauce that goes on top it was heavenly. The vegetables that came with it were cooked and seasoned perfectly. The calamari bruschetta was amazing. I love grilled calamari and this is cooked perfectly. The bread was crispy yet soft enough to soak up all the flavor of the bruschetta. It was very good. The goat Carpaccio was also very delicious. It was full of flavor and the goat was very tender. However, the star of the night was the woodoven roasted pig face. When you mix everything together it is unlike anything you have ever had in your life. Truly one of the best things I have ever eaten. It was followed by an amazing chocolate truffle cake, which is devine if you are a chocolate lover like myself. <br><br>The service: So the service was a little up and down. We had a reservation, but got there a little early so we sat by the bar area to wait to be seated. They have a nice lounge area with comfy couches. The person waiting in that area wasn't really friendly. She didn't bring a drink menu or ask us if we wanted anything. She just sat at the side of the bar, talking with the bartenders. If it wasn't so busy I wouldn't have minded, but it would have been nice to be acknowledged. It was really crowded in this area, and some people were eating so it got cramped fast, not that I minded, just something to be mindful of. Even when we sat down, the tables are pretty crammed together. Our waitress was top notch. We were little lost since this is a different dinning experience that what we are used to, but she provided us with knowledge. She even helped us make our plate so we had just the right amount of food for the two of us. However, the ending was the best part of our night. We ordered champagne and the waitress asked us what we were celebrating, when we told her it was our anniversary, she smiled and wished us congratulations. We thought that was the end of it, but all of the sudden, they brought us out a 2nd dessert ON THE HOUSE. This was completely unexpected and we felt greatly appreciative. When we thanked her, she said it was nothing and milestones need to be acknowledged. Those are the types of things that keep customers coming back!

Reservations can be hard to come by and it makes sense because this place was hopping on a late Sunday evening. <br>The streets were empty and so wete neighboring restaurants, but when we walked in to the Girl and the Goat, it was alive loud and jam packed. The kitchen is an open concept and the ambiance is nice. <br>I just felt like it was too loud and cramped. It felt like we were sharing a table with our neighbors. Â <br>The food is fabulous and sort of tapas style. The fried chickpeas were so creamy and flavorful. Â Next we shared the escargot ravioli. I loved this dish. Â The bacon sauce with the celery, almost gave the dish an Asian taste and some crunchy texture. Â The next plate we shared was the Pig Face. The name sounds scary, but was far from that. Â The pig face (not an actual snout staring right us) was served with potatoes, sunny side up egg and cilantro. Â It was so tasty. Â <br>Our meal ended with some of the best desserts I have ever had. Â We had the Dark Matter Pot de Creme and the Caramel Corn and Malt Balls. Let me start by saying I am a sucker for malt anything and caramel corn, so for this to be incorporated into a single dish, rocked my world. Â The Pot de Creme was equally delicious and had a more savory flare to it. Â  The cocktail list was appealing, but we stuck with the house red wine which was enjoyable. <br>Prices were quite reasonable for this caliber of restaurant. <br>Service felt rushed and less than personal.

Â <br><br>----The Food----<br>Crisp Braised Pork Shank ($26)- WOW. One bite of this tender, succulent pork shank and I delved into my own happy world--nothing else mattered. Â Sharing this flavorful creation will be the worst part of your meal. Â The Kimchee wing sauce and buttermilk dressing make perfect, tasteful dips for the pillowy soft naan too. <br><br>Roasted Pig Face ($18)- This wood oven dish was good, but fell short of expectations, especially since it's one of the more popular signature plates on the menu. It comes with a sunny side egg, Â crispy potato stix, drizzled in tamarind vinaigrette, red-wine maple sauce and cilantro oil. Â It's reminiscent of the pig face at Animal in LA, but more subdued in taste. Â It's messy, it's good, just not mind blowing.<br><br>Grilled Marinated Pork Belly ($15)- Served with radicchio and an aromatic green sauce resembling pureed cilantro and avocado, this pork belly plate had an uplifting, light flavor, but the consistency of the pork belly was oft-putting. Â I felt it was undercooked, giving it a chewier consistency than I can bear. Â <br><br>Confit Goat Belly ($19)- While I'm a big fan of this order, I disliked the tiny portion. Â Smothered in heavy bourbon butter and sprinkled sparingly with lobster/crab, it's a comforting plate that didn't taste as gamey as I thought it would. Â <br><br>Roasted Cauliflower ($11)- Accompanied with pickled peppers, pine nuts and mint, it's a refreshing appetizer that is as good as Bar Ama's in LA.<br><br>Pan Roasted Halibut ($18)- I hate fish, but this masterpiece melts in your mouth and makes your eyes roll back to your skull. Â Made with marcona almond butter, white asparagus, blueberry nuoc cham, the flavors are wonderfully surprising and unique. Â Amazing.<br>-----<br>Conclusion: 4.5 Stars. Your inner carnivore will thank you, after giving the Girl & the Goat a visit.

I was iffy when I saw the little lively mint leaves in the bowl; I absolutely hate eating mint leaves. I love the flavor of mint, but you can LEAVE the fresh thing out of my plate...except here. Here, it fit so perfectly; subtle and not in your face. We also got the goat belly confit off of the goat menu. I loved the buttery-ness. Last plate was the pork shank. This thing was crispy! This was where things went a little off for me. Maybe I had expected a lot from this since we enjoyed the other three plates so much. The meat fell off the bone, which was a plus, but I didn't get much flavors. The buffalo sauce was different, but not so much in a positive way.

He arrives before I do at 5pm on the dot and asks if he can get a table for 2, he's told it's going to be a couple hours wait!!!???? What?? Why on earth were we refused to book a table the day before & why on earth were we told we'd be guaranteed a table upon entry?? Puts his name down for a table and heads to the bar, i texted him from my cab on route to the location and asked him to ask the bartender if they served Sangria because God forbid it's a beautiful day out in Chicago and I fancy a nice cold, refreshing drink! Gets the DIRTIEST look from the bartender as if to say \"If it's not on the cocktail list I'm not making it\" <br>Upon my arrival, I sit down and was greeted at the bar by 3 of the most miserable, unwelcoming, grouchy, judgy and down right rude bar tenders I have ever had the displeasure of meeting! I had my heart set out on Sangria so I needed a minute to decide on an alternative which pissed off this girl so much she literally rolled her eyes at me and walked away. She never came back to me to find out if I'd decided on something so I had to call on the other male bar tender to attend to me! Got our drinks, about 40 minutes later I'm feeling extremely parched and realise I don't have any water! Not only through experience, bar tenders pour you a glass of water the second you sit down and are glancing over the menu, but out of 20-25 people sitting at the bar, my date and I were the ONLY 2 who were not offered water!! This guy was re filling the water glasses of the couple to our left AND our right, casually without taking the time to care that we didn't HAVE any water glasses to top up!! <br>When I asked him for some water, he didn't apologize for not giving us any, honestly felt like I'd just asked him to give up both his kidneys for me seriously it was SO UNCOMFORTABLE!!! 3 painful and excruciating hours later, we had already agreed that there was no way in hell we were staying there for food, which might I add we planned to have at 5:30pm NOT 8:40!!!!!!!<br>We kindly declined our table and asked for the Cheque, we paid but before leaving my date stayed at the bar polishing off his drink while he looked after my bag, coat etc. apparently while I was gone he was asked to move!!!!!

We were only sat at the bar waiting on a table we thought we were going to be given upon entry because they refused us a reservation, treated us like absolute scum, gave us the dirtiest looks all night & now to top it off you're belittling us in front of other customers playing \"good cop\" opting to treat them with the courtesy and respect you should have treated us with??

This wasn't a problem as the service was pretty attentive and speedy.<br><br>The menu: They don't really parse things out by the order things come out, like appetizer, entree, etc., but rather you place all of your order at once and the staff determines the serving sequence for you.<br><br>Hamachi Crudo: Very very fresh and tender raw fish, perfectly complimented by pork belly and seasoning. I wish it was a little bigger though. <br><br>Roasted Cauliflower: I have seen so many raving reviews about this dish on Yelp, and it def didn't disappoint. Perfectly cooked but not mushy yet cauliflower accompanied by cheese, pine nuts, and a little bit of spicy peppers, with dashes of mint for a spur of flavor.... best cauliflowers of my life!<br><br>Roasted Pig Face: By far the best dish for my $$. Two large chunks of very soft and tender pork with an egg on top. It does gets a little heavy and greasy towards the end though.<br><br>Goat Belly: I find it funny that this dish is called the goat belly when the actual belly portion is maybe just a little bit bigger than my thumb. I have to say, it IS a great cut of meat, but the size is just..... There were actual crab and lobster chunks though, which is nice, and they just might be bigger than the actual goat in volume.<br><br>My only complaint is the dinnerware that they use. I collect bone china and I firmly believe how nice the utensils and plates are is an important part of the dining experience. Of course since Girl & the Goat isn't some ultra fancy establishment I def wasn't expecting like Minton or Royal Albert gilded English plates, but their thick and coarse stoneware plates are like, worse than my college cafeteria's.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "A last minute stop for my wife, who has never been here, and I.

Who wants a squash cake in November with the hundreds of other squash dishes already consumed this fall? We demurred, but since it was indeed a birthday, the lovely waitstaff brought us said squash cake to delight. It did have a lovely crunchy counterpart, but it was indeed just a cake that really any home cook could put together for a school bake sale.

They were literally waiting in the wings while we finished a dish and putting the next down. 5 dishes and we were pushed out in an hour. We are not slow eaters.

She went on and on about how bad it was, how none of the flavors went together, and she didn't even need it taken off of her bill, was just so horrified that she had to say something. I assumed she was being pretentious and aiming to have the dish removed from her bill. Then at dinner after I had ordered the confit and we were talking about the girl in the lounge, I started to realize that the confit had been the dish in question. I was open-minded, but trust me when I say it was one of the worst dishes I've ever had. We passed it around the table just so we could have a shared awful experience. My husband captured it perfectly when he said \"it's like if a clown college had a culinary division.\" Â It was so wacky and terrible. <br><br>I know this comes off as really angry and snide.

The restrooms are very clean and well maintained.<br><br>This place serves small plates and each small plate is sufficient for one to two people. All of the items I ordered were great, but if I had to choose one it would have to be the Wood Grilled Broccoli. Without a doubt, it was the best broccoli I have ever had. One bite of it and you instantly taste the transfer of smoke from the wood to the broccoli. It's good by itself, but the cheese that is on the bottom of the plate compliments it. I also enjoyed the ham frites. The fries are thinly cut and comes with two different dipping sauces. I both the sauces, but the cheddar beer sauce was out of control. I had to control myself from not finishing that dipping sauce myself! The Duck tongues were good as well, as the chip gave the soft, delicate meat and good crunch; however, I found it to be a bit too salty for my liking.

The idea was great but I think if this was served on individual Chinese spoons, it would've been much better - you get the sauce and the ravioli in one bite. 2/5<br><br>Confit Goat Belly:<br>Goat belly, lobster, crab, fennel in bourbon butter. Lobster claw pieces, chunks of crab meat and a baton of slightly fatty, tender, juicy goat belly. This was one of my favorites from Girl & the Goat. This prevented us from leaving the restaurant. 5/5<br><br>Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face:<br>Pork cheek, potato sticks, sunny side egg (over easy), tamarind, cilantro and red wine maple. Another winner in my book. Breakfast on a plate. Like bacon, eggs and potatoes. Crisp pork cheek and potato sticks, soft egg, sweet and sour tamarind and added layers of flavor from the cilantro and red wine maple. YUM! 5/5<br><br>Bittersweet Chocolate:<br>Shiitake-caramel gelato, brownie and toffee creme fraiche. The gelato was great. The brownie was just alright and there was too much of it. I liked the hint of toffee. Marginal dessert. 3/5<br><br>PB&J:<br>Salted peanut semifreddo, brioche doughnuts and grape granita. I'm not a fan of peanut butter but I was pleasantly surprised by this dessert. Cold semifreddo and granita, and warm doughnuts. The semifreddo wasn't too nutty and the grape granita was perfect with it. Delish! 4/5<br><br>Service was great. Bread isn't complimentary.

We heard from a few people we knew that this was the place to go. I did see a mix amount of reviews but my cousin said I had to go. So we tried to make reservations 3 weeks in advance because we heard it was hard to get in and we still only got a 11:30 pm reservation. But we thought hey we are on vacation lets eat something a little earlier it should be ok. <br><br>So we get there at 10:45 hoping they could take us early. It doesn't hurt and we were already ready anyways. So we get there and they said they probably cant seat us till 11:30 so we said ok that is fare lets go by the bar area and relax. They do have a lounge area you could eat at that was really empty when we were there but the seating just a little more uncomfortable. But its up to you if you cant get a reservation try walking in and sitting there.<br><br>So, as we are getting walked to our table they said its your lucky day you get to see at the Chef's Table. Although this was a cool experience I will say it gets very hot because your so close to the stoves. Also you don't know what to order because a million things come out and EVERYTHING looks so good. So It is a little confusing because your wondering what you should eat. <br><br>We had: <br>The green beans and those were surprisingly really good. I was a little nervous to order them because I felt like they are just green beans but I was so wrong. The combination of flavor was excellent. It does have fish sauce so if your not into that I would not order this. <br><br>Complementary: because we were sitting here we did get something on the chef which was the cauliflower which was also very good. The pine nuts give it a nice crunch and it was really good. <br><br>Bread: we had the Sweet Onion Brioche Tarragon butter. Spring lamby jam when we were waiting. The bread was average but the onion spread was amazing. It was sweet and it reminded us of something my fiance mom makes. It is a caramelized onion on bread. <br><br>Fish - We had the halibut. OMG BEST THING on the menu! You have to have this. I believe it was the best fish I ever had and we live in Vegas and have had some incredible fishes but this was excellent. I would come back here and order 3 of these and just make it my meal. It melts in your mouth and it was just so tasty. <br><br>Pig face - so we ordered this because everyone suggested it and it was very good. The meat is tender and juicy. It also has a crunch to it.<br><br>Goat- since this is called girl and a goat we thought we had to order a goat dish. Confit Goat Belly Bourbonâ Butter . Lobster and Crab . Fennel was what we ordered. Although the dish looked very pretty it was my least favorite. I would pass on this one. The lobster and crab on the meal is really good but the goat wasn't for me. Its a very small piece of meat and it isn't worth the money your spending on it. Overall our experience was great and I highly recommend this spot.

Unfortunately, i wasn't able to take photo of each dish (due to professionalism for this dinner). Overall, it was served family style and each entree mostly veggie dishes were well balanced with flavor. If you have nut allergy, you may have challenge with the menu. Overall, will come back and try something different! BTW, i heard it's really hard to score a reservation.<br><br>House bread - it was delicious and hearty. Warm and soft complimented with cream cheese butter and tomato.<br><br>warm marinated olive- Usually not a fan of olive, but these were plump and juicy like a cherry.<br><br>kohirabi salad (fennel, evalon, toasted almond) - Flavorful and refreshing greenies.<br><br>Grilled baby octopus (fava bean, pea tips, pistachio, and lemon vinaigrette) - one of my favorite!! the octopus was not too well done and soft. I really like the compliments with the octopus. <br><br>green garlic pierogies (rhubarb chimichurri) - Favorite... the pierogie was lightly fried and was soft with potato inside. Love it! <br><br>roasted cauliflower (pinenuts, mint, pickled peppers) - Good, but doesnt stand out.<br><br>pan roasted halibut (marcona almond butter) - Good and cooked just right. <br><br>sauteed green beans (fish sauce vinaigrette and cashews) - Good Â and doesn't quite stand out.<br><br>wood grilled broccoli - least favorite and too salty. No thanks<br><br>crisp braised pork shank (buttermilk dressing, kimchee sauce, and Â naan) - LOVE IT - pork was soft and tender. It was nicely presented. I recommend skipping the buttermilk dressing and kimchi sauce, which doesnt compliment too well with the pork shank. The pork itself can be eaten alone. <br><br>assortment of dessert - consist of 4 different ice cream/gelato desserts. All 4 were quite similar (complimented with some sort of chocolate with vanilla ice cream) Â and was really good.

We ordered the green beans (always great), the sea bass (pass), the goat belly with lobster (yum), the bucatini (divine) and the pork shank (my favorite). The dish we would pass on was the sea bass. The seasoning on it was so strong that you could not taste anything but the seasoning which is a shame on such a delicate dish. We also had the Petite Verdot that is made by them in partnership with a vineyard in Walla Walla and it was so yum. We moved to Washington 3 years ago and when you smelled and tasted it, it was just like Washington. The only critique I have of this restaurant is that everything is so heavily seasoned that it feels a bit hard to find a progression of flavors. There is a need for some things that are more delicate in flavors.

We were excited to take our seats, even though our seats were at 10:15pm on a Sunday. What can I say, even with 2-3 weeks notice that was the only reservation available! Taking our seats was even harder than that, though-10:15pm on a Sunday it was packed like sardines, couples waiting ahead of us for what seemed like a while for their tables. We didn't get our seats until 10:45. Thank you for the free bread as a token of your apologies. I would've preferred the sparkling wine you brought to the couple beside us, but I won't complain too much.<br><br>When finally sitting down, we were surprised to get a look at the menu-not many dishes over $15 on the whole thing. I was expecting to pay more, I'll put it that way. We were advised to go for about 2 dishes per person, and we did. Sticking to our pescetarian lifestyle, we chose the grilled octopus salad (sans ham), soft shell crab rice, ramp and rhubarb pierogies and the sesame shishito peppers. We enjoyed two cocktails with this meal, and we weren't really feeling like drinking more that night, though the wine list was nice. <br><br>The standout dish for me was the sesame shishitos and soft shell crab. The crab was the smallest portion by a lot-one pan fried soft shell served on top of sticky rice-though it was delicious I wanted more of it. The shishitos were opposite; it was a huge crock of small delicious peppers. Usually, when I have a dish of shishito peppers, it comes with like, 9 peppers. There were dozens here. They were smothered in cheese and sesame and were amazing.<br><br>We ended the night with cinnamon toast crunch rice pudding, again with rhubarb. There was so much rhubarb! I appreciated the ultra seasonal ingredients, but like 3 of the 5 dishes contained rhubarb. I guess they had a plethora of it that night.<br><br>Overall, I did enjoy the meal, and once we were seated everyone was attentive and kind.

Ultimately, trying new things won out, except we could not forgo the green beans in the fish sauce - just too good to miss! We also had a mini of the roasted cauliflower with pickled peppers and mint, the maple glazed lamb ribs, goat belly with crab and lobster, and goat empanadas with blueberry and grilled pineapple slaw atop smashed avocado. We followed up with chocolate cake and shiitake gelato on top of toffee creme fraiche, drizzled with salted caramel and a mini of the vanilla malt gelato we had last time! Minds blown again!

It was served with a delicious cheese spread and salsa. This was my second favorite dish of the night, and it was only $4. <br><br>Pan fried shishito peppers - These were just okay. I liked them, but not enough to make them their own dish. It would be better if these were just a side that came with something else. <br><br>Hamachi Crudo - Easily the least value, and least favorite dish of the night. Given that the first ingredient listed is pork belly, I expected to actually get a fair amount of pork belly along with the \"crudo\" portion, but this dish comes with ~3 tiny pieces of pork belly. It came with a few crazy thin shavings of bread, and the raw fish which was pretty bland. <br><br>Goat Empanadas - These were really good. They came with healthy amount of guacamole that pairs well with the empanadas. The meat inside was tender and flavorful.<br><br>Wood Fired Halibut - One of the best pieces of fish that I have ever had. Very moist and the sauce was incredible. Order this for sure if you are a fan of fish.<br><br>Wood oven roasted pig face - This was good, but after all the hype and seeing thousands of pictures/reviews for it on here I thought it fell flat. It just tasted like a bacon and egg breakfast that you can get at any place in the city. <br><br>Atmosphere - Looks cool on the inside, tables are super close together and it's pretty loud. Depending on the table you get, it can be hard to hear your server. The other part about sitting so close to people is you hear their conversations whether you like it or not.

I was grateful they could accommodate us last minute but you could tell our seating was where they stick walk-ins and last minute accommodations. Kind of in the corner yet still in the middle of all the traffic. And the kitchen was hot.

The waitress said she would choose the best course lineup and would take care of us. The first meal was the crispy beef short ribs. They were definitely crispy on the outside but not as tender as I'd like on the inside. The sauce was tangy yet sweet with pops of grapefruit and avocado. The sauce was real good. <br><br>Crispy beef short ribs: 7/10<br><br>Then came the chickpea fritter. So delicious. It came with tons of fixins which was like an explosions of flavor with a little spice. <br><br>Chickpea fritter: 9.5/10<br><br>Next came the star of the show: escargot ravioli. It was very light with the perfect chewiness of the escargot. The escargot was very traditional garlic and butter and the whole plate had onion crisps on top. It was by far the best part of the meal. <br><br>Escargot ravioli: 10/10<br><br>A surprise (complementary) fourth meal of wood grilled broccoli followed. This was probably due to us making friends with the kitchen staff who was responsible for the broccoli order. We were pretty excited! It had a nice smokey flavor to it and the blue cheese sauce and spiced rice crispies were the perfect complement. If I were to go again, though, I would probably pass on the broccoli and explore other menu items. <br><br>Wood grilled broccoli: Â 7/10<br><br>Finally came the confit goat belly. The goat belly had a crispy exterior but the middle melted in your mouth. It wasn't as fatty as pork belly that I've had in the past, but still good. The star of the plate was the lobster n' crab that accompanied the goat belly.

She then brought us our check, which was correct, but she didn't provide any concessions for messing up our meal.

The pig face was also really good because it came with a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg and had nice fried crispy strips. My girlfriend thought this was the best dish of the night and I have to agree. Unfortunately, the goat dishes were a bit underwhelming. The goat emapanadas only came with 2 pieces, but they were well stuffed with goat. It tasted a bit too salty, but the sauce balanced it out well. Also, the goat belly came with an extremely small portion, and the butter sauce did not pair that well with the dish. However, the goat belly was well cooked and soft. Lastly, we ordered the oysters and got to try all 3 different cooking styles for the oysters.

The best way to eat this menu is tapas style, so the four of us girls got drinks and each ordered a dish to share.

Avid followers of Top Chef will recall Stephanie Izard immediately; she was the winner of Season 4 - the first female chef to achieve the title of \"Top Chef\". Since then, she's successfully opened Girl & The Goat, her most popular restaurant, as well as Little Goat, and published her first cookbook (Girl in The Kitchen) in 2011. Needless to say, our expectations going in were quite high.<br><br>Despite our reservation, we weren't seated until 10 or 15 minutes afterwards, which normally wouldn't have been an issue, but given the already late time, was made dramatically more painful. Regardless, we were promptly seated by our cheerful server, who gave us a quick overview of the menu, including the shared plates format as well as some highlighted dishes. After perusing the various section (split out between Vegetables, Fish, Meats, Bread, and of course Goat headers), we decided on five plates to share, which were brought out intermittently throughout our meal.<br><br>First to arrive was the Hamachi Crudo, a plate consisting of four slices of hamachi topped with a handful of diced crispy pork belly, a chili aioli, and a few pieces of thinly sliced, toasted bread. On paper, the dish sounded far more attractive than the actual taste. I missed a noticeable punch of acidity that should have accompanied the hamachi, and the pairing of pork belly and fish easily overwhelmed the latter. The sliced caperberries were a creative addition, but one that I failed to see the utility of, especially as it further served to mask the flavor of the hamachi. Thankfully, the Nantucket Bay Scallops were much more successful, as the sauteed scallops were paired with earthy beech mushrooms and a creamy french letil puree, followed by a slight lift with the celery root.<br><br>I'm grateful we added the Ham Frites to our order, as we were given a generous serving of thin fries which came with an accompanying Smoked Tomato Aioli, as well as a Cheddar Beer sauce. I would have appreciated a simple side of ketchup, though, as both sauces were rather heavy, especially in conjunction. It was a stark contrast to our final two dishes: first, the Roasted Duck Breast. The protein was cooked to an enviable medium, and topped with a garnish of rapini, peppers, and crispy rice noodles. The miso-marcona almond butter was relatively faint, although it did pair well with the sauteed onions and broccolini that formed the base of the dish. Less impressive was the Goat Belly confit, a dish that took a small portion of confited goat belly topped with an overzealous amount of sliced fennel and a nearly indistinguishable serving of lobster and crab. The goat belly was on the tougher side, and the already distinct gaminess clashed with the brininess of the shellfish.<br><br>In hindsight, perhaps my biggest complaint about Girl and The Goat, aside from dishes that scored across the board in terms of successfulness, was the relatively small portion size of each plate. Despite having five shared plates, we were still left wanting by the end of the meal... not a desirable outcome after spending nearly $100 on just the food. Perhaps I'm just biased, but I don't see why the restaurant has been met with such widespread acclaim; unfortunately, since it's also a lengthy plane ride away, I may never know.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DfTxBSqUar6W5DT6BUcAgw/348s.jpg", "caption": "Goat Belly"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9qcMvjBzrna6yUwPGvMf-A/168s.jpg", "caption": "Duck Breast"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XUmrqXT8xrbVBZXhD5N4iw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Ham Frites"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "This was easily the best meal I've ever had in my life.

Tip: Reserve a table beforehand because the place is pretty busy and packed. We were seated a little after 9:15 and our server explained how the servings worked. Great service. For 2 people, If you are an average eater, I'd recommend ordering 3 dishes plus one small plate and then go for the dessert in the end.

Soft and crusty with olives in it and served with whipped feta and olive oil on the side.

The garam masala yogurt is delicious.<br><br>Next came in wood grilled broccoli. It was decent.

My girlfriend and I got the goat carpaccio, duck tartare, calamari bruschetta, the grilled broccoli, the pig face, and the gjetost dessert.<br><br>I will say that, despite how many times I've seen it mentioned here, I'd advise against the pig face, not because it wasn't tasty but because it wasn't particularly interesting. If you want something that's just pleasantly satisfying, it's a fine choice, but that's probably not why you're thinking about going here.<br><br>Everything else was absolute out of this world. Not having had much goat, the carpaccio was incredibly rich and flavorful with an unique maple-olive vinaigrette. The calamari on the bruschetta was the most flavorsome piece of cooked squid I had ever had on top of a rich base of goat milk ricotta and sprinkled with these scrumptious little bits of goat bacon. I don't know what they did to that broccoli - maybe it was the grilling - but that was the most savory preparation of broccoli I've experienced. I don't mean salty, I mean it was like eating a cross between broccoli and a grilled steak. However, far-and-away, the best dish of the night was the duck tartare. The raw duck meat was tossed with a bit of sesame oil and served with mushrooms, charred brussels sprout petals, a slightly spicy mayo, and some thin, crispy duck fat-fried lavash. All the flavors and textures came together into this perfect bite. There are a handful of dishes I've had in my life that have stuck with me years after I've eaten them, and this has definitely been added to the list. Oh yeah, and the dessert was amazing too. Apple cake with your usual warm baking spices, crunchy candied almonds sort of like a brittle, and this ice cream - not knowing my Norwegian foods very well, I had to look up what gjetost was (it's a cheese) - this ice cream was savory and rich and sweet and had a bit of a dark sort of brulee'd flavor to it.

True. <br>But a word of caution on the goat neck: it is humongous. For 4 (or more!) people to share (not 2 as we were told). It's just a large large larrrrrge portion. Of deliciousness that is. The meat was incredibly tender, seasoned to perfection and the accompaniments made the whole thing be a feast for your tastebuds. Just waaaay too large of a portion. It seemed wasteful. And that's why I took away one star. Well that and the having to book weeks in advance to get a table at a regular dinner time.

The waiters and waitresses were super attentive and catered to our every need! <br><br>Okay on to the food. The roasted cauliflower was SO GOOD. I wish I ordered two plates of that stuff! It was nice and smokey, and with the pine nuts and mint = DELICIOUS! The pig face was pretty good, but I don't really like the fatty-ish pieces of meat, so in retrospect I probably shouldn't have ordered this... The confit goat belly was delicious! The sauces that came with it were really interesting and I recommend that one. The only one I don't recommend is the grilled baby octopus. We were recommended this one by the waitress, and I thought the flavors were a little bit too strong altogether. It was little too salty, bitter, and while it wasn't bad, I just did not like it that much. <br><br>Overall, it's a great restaurant to check out in Chicago, and if I ever find myself in the Windy City again, I will make a trip here!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Tasty, tasty, tasty!

The standards are raised one notch and through all the hype it becomes difficult to manage. I will not lie in that I had major hopes for this restaurant as we even made reservations a month in advance. We were able to snag a 8:30 PM reservation for a party of six and made our way over in the freezing cold on Thursday night for dinner. The joint itself is very large and the dÃ©cor is great providing a hipster vibe and not being too pretentious. We arrived and were greeted immediately by the hostess who told us it would take a few moments for our table to be set up. After our table was set, we were brought over and our server approached us immediately. She was super sweet and was very helpful in explaining all the menu items including providing her recommendations.<br><br>After perusing the menu for a bit we first decided on a few bottles of vino which is obviously always a great choice. We then started diving deep into the food and after a bit of thinking we decided to go with the honey sambal brioche, don't curry be happy, pan fried shisito peppers, roasted beets, wood grilled broccoli, chickpea fritter, Hamachi crudo, grilled baby octopus, ham frites, duck tongues, confit goat belly, sugo, and a few desserts. The breads were the first to come out and the honey sambal brioche was just solid. The honey butter was perfect with it and the bread was fluffy and delicious. The don't curry be happy bread was fine and good but nothing that really stood out in my mind. The shishito peppers were da BOMB. Yeah they were probably the best shishito peppers I have ever had with the right amount of spice complimented by the parmeasan. I could eat this dish alone for days. The roasted beet salad was surprisingly solid and I was a fan at how they brought in all the flavors together. The Broccoli was ok but personally I thought the smokiness was a bit too strong which drowned out all the other senses. The ham frites came out and these things were just killer also. Big fan of the tomato aioli sauce and the sprinkling of toppings on top was just perfect. We devoured these pretty quickly. The Hamachi crudo then came out and this sashimi paired perfectly with the pork belly. Again a well executed dish but for me nothing abnormal. The baby octopus was the next dish on the table and this dish was well executed. Delicious and the combination of flavors was perfect and the veggies were sautÃ©ed perfectly. The duck tongues were the next to join the table and obviously most of the folks at my table were a bit scared to try this... but this is pretty common dish I feel. I thoroughly enjoyed the flavors of this and the poke was the perfect pair to this dish. Again this is definitely executed well if you are able to get over the fact that you are eating tongue haha. Be adventurous yelpers!! The confit goat belly was tender and just solid all around. <br><br>This is not a pretentious place where they spend hours on plating they are looking to make good quality food and they are very good in this space. This place was solid and its unfortunate that were just a few dishes that did not jive with me but the ones that killed it were absolutely delicious. Still a great place to go and it is not overhyped by any means. Definitely a spot to try", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Baaaaaah to the goat.

Hamachi and crispy pork belly make a surprisingly delicious combination, but this didn't live up to the \"hype\" of Girl and the Goat for me. I'd skip this dish unless you really love hamachi and/or pork belly.<br>Goat Carpaccio: We though since we were here, why not try some goat. The boyfriend and I both never had goat before this and thought we'd go all out with raw meat. Good dish, but nothing impressive.<br>Roasted Cauliflower: Almost every Yelp review mentioned this dish, so of course we had to get it. And finally, a dish that lived up to my expectations! This was my favorite dish of the night and I could've just eaten three orders of this and been happy. The mint, pine nuts, peppers were perfect with the roasted cauliflower -- such a unique, great combo. This is a MUST ORDER dish.<br>Pan Roasted Halibut: Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm not a big fan of fish, but this was SO good. The fish was a touch overcooked (dry =/) but the sauce fixed that problem. The menu says the fish comes/is cooked with a marcona almond butter and blueberry nuoc cham, which reminds me of a ponzu-y flavor but more sour and pungent.<br>Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face: The boyfriend was hesitant about this after I told him I wanted to try it. Days before we hit up Girl and the Goat, he goes on Google and reads about how the dish is made, which really does involve cooking the pig's face. When the dish came, that was all the could think about and could only eat so much. He was definitely overthinking it and weirding himself out, but I loved it. It has a taste that reminds me of teriyaki, but I can't quite put my finger on what food it reminds me off. But whatever. It's delicious. Order it.<br><br>While some dishes were underwhelming, the overall experience was great. Our water was constantly refilled and they switched out our dirty dishes three times.

If you wanted to try a \"new\" vegetable dish here with a large group, this might be it. However, it gets only a 3 in comparison to the rest (sorry I'm not sorry)<br><br>5) Country fried loup de mer <br>4/5. The portion arrived larger than we expected! Fish was fried to perfection and the salad/rice nicely complemented the dish. I would've enjoyed this more if I wasn't stuffing my face with (7) - don't skip the list yet!<br><br>6) Goat medallions<br>2/5. I had this more than a year ago and it doesn't seem to be on the menu anymore (good). It was too rare for my liking and just pales in comparison to whatever else I was pigging on.

I cannot comprehend how a dish this simple can be so satisfying and addictive (and not to mention, that has a recipe openly shared by Izzard herself!). This is the granddaddy of them ALL. I would say one portion is good for a group of 4. Please don't deprive yourself by sharing this with too many people. I would NEVER go to Girl and the Goat and NOT order this. <br><br>8) Miso butterscotch budino<br>5/5. BACON TOFFEE. It was savory and sweet (both in the right amounts), and pretty unique!

The dish had a lot of asian influences--fish sauce, citrus notes--and was perfect. I was so sad when it was gone. <br><br>Green beans were okay, but were nice to have as we waited for our dishes to be served. *I have to say that service was great--dishes came out with perfect timing (as soon as we finished the prior dish) and were saved from lightest to heaviest. Waters were always refilled.*<br><br>Black cod was okay. Very intricate in its usage of various ingredients but compared to the halibut, it was a bit bland.<br><br>Pork belly was my least favorite. The pork seemed a bit burnt and charred in some areas which left bitter notes in my mouth.<br><br>We ordered the pork belly with egg based on reviews on Yelp. It was a good plate, but was much sweeter than we expected. If the sweetness level was reduced, it would have been a much better dish overall. I could only manage a few bites. <br><br>Lastly, the brioche was wonderful--light, buttery--and the free dessert was the perfect palate cleanser. We had also ordered a bottle of wine to accompany the meal, and it was a great recommendation from our waitress--Bravo! <br><br>Definitely a pricey meal--around $180 for 2 people but worth it, personally, due to the quality of food and service.

The restaurant is funky with the giant modern piece of a girl and goat which hangs over the corner wall. The gentle lighting creates a sense of wonder and the flavors excite the palate. We tried the crudo, fries, pork, bruschetta calamari, cauliflower, bass, the chickpea fritters and goat empanadas. The highlights were the cauliflower- the best I have ever had. It was perfectly charred and was served with pine nuts, fresh mint, and peppers. The textures and flavors were unique and truly something that surprised the palate. I can only hope I can make a version of this dish. The chickpea fritters were a wonderful texture- a perfect crunch and a nice soft center. The peas and tomatoes accented the dish perfect. The crudo was good, but I have to say the quality of the fish wasn't up to my standard, it could have something to do with me living in San Francisco... where fresh seafood is abundant. The fries were just fries. The bass had a killer green curry sauce with a lot of citrus elements to it which I enjoyed immensely. The pork dish was a bit dry, and the ranch dressing did not go with the dish at all. I understand the thought behind the ranch, giving the dish a cool element from the spicy sauce (which was also on the side) but for me it doesn't work- this isn't buffalo wings. The goat empanadas didn't do anything for me. All and all a wonderful place!

I always order octopus if it's on a menu. So I am familiar with different tastes and textures. This octopus has got to be on my top 3.

It's original and never been done. We all know how to eat the garlic drenched escargot we have come to love but have you ever had it like this? Probably not...but you should! It was exactly what I envisioned...but I would call them dumplings rather than ravioli. The escargot were tender not chewy and had that earthy taste you either love or hate about them. I happen to love it. The miso based sauce was a perfect accompaniment! <br><br>Sagu- I appreciated this dish though it was not my favorite! I actually loved the pappardelle cut and the fact that you can taste its \"homemade\" pasta feel. It came with a mixture of goat and beef in a red sauce....that's all.<br><br>Pig face- I'm not a HUGE fan of pig. But I knew this was one of their signature dishes. Plus it came with a fried egg ;) I understood why it was one of their signature dishes as soon as I tasted it. The pork face was tender and not too pungent. It was cooked perfectly!

Fast-forward two hours and we were both extremely pleased! While we do not want to say this is \"the best restaurant ever\", we could not think of a better food experience! <br><br>Service - our service was very good! We asked a lot of questions and our server answered all of them spending quite a good bit of time with us (pre-food). <br><br>Food - Amazing!! We ordered 4 items (all made to share) and a dessert. We did not get a bread. I was on the fence as some reviews said you must try a bread. They look delicious, but we opted to save space for other items! We ordered the goat empanadas, crispy short ribs, the green beans and the pork shank. delicious!! the goat empanadas were my least favorite - however, they were very, very good! This speaks to the level of everything else in my opinion. The crispy shortribs were cubed, crispy and fell apart perfectly. This was a lighter dish, which you would not usually expect paired with avocado and grapefruit - excellent! The green beans (large portion) and the pork shank were my favorite!! I would get both again!! The sauce that comes with the pork shank I would buy by the bottle! The pork shank was extremely tender. We pulled the meat right off of the bone.

The food is delicious, creative, and locally inspired. <br><br>We went without a reservation, with a hope and dream that we could get in, and sure enough, we did. There was some magic to that...beyond what could be explained in a Yelp review.<br><br>The menu has a good variety of selection to meet whatever you're looking for - vegetables, vegetarian, vegan, paleo, unique, local. There are small plate options, so you can try several dishes without having to settle on one dish you want to try. There is a special \"goat\" menu, which didn't show prices on it when we were there. Regardless, we ordered the mysterious goat shoulder. We were warned that it was large, and we were confident (maybe overconfident) that we could eat all of it. We also ordered some other small plates with it - a beef tongue dish with chimichurri, some roast cauliflower, and a seafood dish. We enjoyed those dishes and then came the goat...which was basically a baby goat braised, on a platter, and served with several dipping sauce options. It was amazing. Melt in your mouth, and flavorful sauces to pair. It was also huge! We made a very small dent and then took the rest to go. <br><br>Though the price wasn't listed on the menu considering it was basically an entire small goat, the price shouldn't have surprised us. ~$90 for just the goat.

I had to see for myself what this venue had to offer. It was hard to schedule a table with only a few days to pick from, but not impossible. So far so good. They also let me change our party reservation from 2 to 3 at the eleventh hour. Good stuff. <br><br>The dining space was warm and well lit but very noisy and tight on space. We never got comfortable especially where leg room was concerned. Â As soon as we were seated, water was poured and the waiter started to explain the tapas style menu. We asked about their recommendations and popular dishes, but with a revolving menu, it is plain to see what favourites have made a lasting impression on city diners.<br><br>APPETIZERS<br><br>We opted for the MUSHROOM BREAD variety and enjoyed the moist warm bread, and the tomato olive drizzle almost as much as the mushroom paste. Nothing extraordinary, but a great alternative to regular bread paniers. They recommended the hummus version but we went against the grain on this one, pun intended. <br><br>THE GOAT EMPANADAS were next up. These were slightly too salty but well dressed with a cream cheese onion and tomato garnish that dialed down the sel. Pretty good. <br><br>GOAT LIVER MOOSE- This was a popular dish. We ordered it later because we realized we had more room after our entrees, but I'm glad we did. The crumpets were warm and gooey, and the grilled orange-rines compot was my favorite spread. The pickled cawliflower and regular pickles were not a delectable match at all. The Goat Moose jam, was just a-okay. Â  Truthfully, Â I could have eaten the biscuits on their own so this item is still worth the buy but not the fuss.<br><br>THE BABY OCTOPUS also failed in my eye. Greatly in fact. This new addition to the menu needs to be taken back to the drawing board. The shallots, beets, and bean salad was too acidic, though I liked their treatment of the green and white beans (blanched to perfection). The octopus had no taste, especially after our wonderful octopus treat at Carnivale the night before (see my full review).<br><br>ENTREES<br><br>THE BEEF CHEEKS are actually on the entree menu but the serving is so small, even for a tapas approach, that nearly marked it down as an appy. I really enjoyed the fun textures here- slippery beef, crunchy oniony stix, all swimming in a broth bath. This was one of my favorite dishes but I was the only one so satisfied. The rest of the table did not enjoy this plate at all. Â <br><br>ESCARGOT RAVIOLI- The snail was tender and chewy, and well seasoned, but the sauce was, again, way too salty. We could barely finish this plate, small as it was.<br><br>Going by previous yelpers' enthusiasm, I knew I wouldn't leave without trying the infamous WOOD-ROASTED OPEN PIG FACE. As per usual, the waiters encouraged us to mash it all up for a full flavour explosion. Â I did enjoy the combo of the fried eggs, potato stix and the barbecued meat, but this is nothing you couldn't pull off at home, and that says a lot about a dining experience. Bold creation, puttered execution.<br><br>DESSERT<br><br>MISO-BUTTERSCOTH BUDINO- When it came time for dessert, we had room for one and only one pick, to be shared three ways. We took Antonio's recommendation and gave the Budino a try. Â I liked the marriage of bacon toffee and cashews, and the feel of foamy whip on candied pineapple, but I didn't get butterscotch in my spoonfuls. Â It was a nice finish but didn't taste as good as it sounded or looked, a theme for the night I'd say.<br><br>Overall, the fusionistic approach to menu and meal creation is admirable, and service and staff give you a pleasurable dining experience , but most of the courses didn't impress us, and NONE impressed ALL of us.<br><br>Everything comes in a small portion and I can't help but think this is part of the marketing genius behind this restaurant cause we could not have eaten many bites of any of it. <br><br>I will add that this was a midway value given the number of courses we had and our $60 bottle of wine- three diners parted with $75 each after a handsome tip. Not bad. <br><br>At the end of the day, fancy titles don't mask what's really going on here. An interesting menu born out of a creative mind but not worth more than a free trial. Even the waiter had to admit the ''drip coffee'' was nothing more than coffee on marketing steroids. <br><br>I RECOMMEND: The empanadas to meat lovers and the breads and cheeses to vegetarians.<br><br>EXTRA TIP: Ask your waiter what's new on the menu since it changes, and stick to the old!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The family and I ate dinner here last night..

Everything else was new to me. <br><br>We started with the summer tom bread, which was not complimentary. It came with tomato oil and spring onion cream cheese, and I have to admit it was worth paying for. We also wolfed down the spring onion pot stickers and the goat empanadas. The pot stickers were pleasant, sweet and vegetal with ripe corn, rhubarb, dandelion greens, and sunflower seeds. The goat empanadas were a highlight of the meal, one of the best goat dishes I've come across in my admittedly limited goat-eating experience. The empanadas were crisped golden, and they came with a harmonious mix of grilled blueberries, miso-harissa aioli, and a farm veggie slaw.

The kalbi was tender and glazed thick with sauce, and the sides were interesting and very on point. Shifting to seafood, we had some wood-fired scallops and tempura soft shell crab. The scallops were silky and supple, and they came with sugar snap peas and a bacon currant chimichurri, all in an irresistible smoked uni cream sauce. The soft shell crab was also nice, though probably the least memorable dish of the night. It came with sweet corn elote and a shallot aioli.<br><br>The pan-roasted halibut might have been my favorite dish of our meal. The fish was perfectly cooked, moist and flaky and full of mild flavor. It came with Marcona almond buter, white asparagus, and a hauntingly delicious blueberry nuoc cham sauce. Dinner ended with the crisp braised pork shank, which was probably overkill. It was a huge portion of juicy pork, served with naan, buttermilk dressing, and stone fruit kimchi. It was impossible to finish, but certainly worth a strong effort.<br><br>We shared two desserts, one of which was comped for Tristan's birthday, presented with a candle. The first was the bittersweet chocolate with Thai basil-chocolate chip gelato and blackberries, an excellent chocolate dessert with an unusual mix of complementary flavors. The sticky date cake was even better, a sweet, addictive, dense little cake served with blueberry preserves and a side of MontAmore gelato. I was really into that light cheesy gelato.<br><br>We had a great time at Girl & the Goat, and I'd love to come back again on my next trip to Chicago.

The restaurant was pretty crowded, but we had a reservation and were seated once our whole party had arrived. Our waiter was friendly and helpful with good recommendations from the menu. We had the brioche, cuttlefish, catfish, cauliflower, pig face, crispy short rib, and the lamb empanada for our meal. The citrus brioche was disappointing. The bread was dry and lacked the buttery taste we were expecting. However, everything else was very tasty. The cuttlefish had a great char. The catfish came on this really well seasoned rice. The cauliflower is always good with the pine nuts and peppers. If veggies were always this tasty, I could probably make myself eat more of them. The crispy short rib was also a stand out. Very tender and nicely refreshing with the avocado and radish. The pig face was tasty but the flavors were not very complex. The lamb empanada was also tasty and comes with 2 so you can share it pretty easily with 4 people. For dessert, we shared the pineapple cake and the caramel popcorn dessert. The pineapple cake was the favorite and was so delicious. I could eat another portion of that all by myself. Pretty much everything on the menu sounds good so you can't really go wrong. Come with friends so you can order lots and share things. Portions are on the smaller side so you'll have to order about 6 dishes for 4 people.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Dinner at this restaurant capped off our visit to Chi City, and I'm so glad that we made this reservation on the recommendation of a friend right after she found out we were going on this trip. Boyfriend had made the reservation as a late birthday gift to me -- and we had to make it about 2 months in advance.<br><br>We lucked out and were seated right in front of the open kitchen, so we had a first-hand view of everyone preparing and serving the food. We sat in front of the salad/tartare chef and the dessert chef. If you can manage to snag this seat, then I highly recommend you do! The chefs were so nice and were more than happy to provide answers for any question that I had (including, but not limited to \"what are you doing,\" \"what's that,\" and \"did I order this?\").<br><br>We ordered the wood grilled broccoli (with rogue smokey bleu sauce and spiced crispies), goat liver mousse (served with watermelon salad, smoked pear mostarda and crumpets), and the wood oven roasted pig face (with sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantry, red wine-maple sauce and potato stix). We were also comped a plate of pan fried shishito peppers because our waitress felt that they would be a good compliment to our other dishes. And I also received a little complimentary dessert of the peach and blueberry crumble with honey graham cake and goat cheese gelato as Boyfriend had put down that it was my birthday as the special occasion :)<br><br>Gonna break it down by dish here, but for an early tl;dr -- IT WAS ALL AMAZING AND YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY GO IF YOU GET A CHANCE TO.<br><br>Wood grilled broccoli -- this was probably Boyfriend's favorite dish of the entire evening. He was IN LOVE. Normally, we're not big fans of bleu cheese, but the dressing on the grilled broccoli was light enough not to be overwhelming and perfectly complimented the grilled taste of the broccoli. This was an amazingly light appetizer that we inhaled.<br><br>Goat liver mousse -- I was honestly worried that this was going to be waaay too rich for me to enjoy (like the duck liver mousse I've had at State Bird Provisions -- too rich to finish), but it wasn't too rich at all! I mean, it's rich -- but not so much that you felt as though it were coating your throat and arteries as you swallowed. It was AMAZING when you spread it on the crumpets and topped it with the smoked pear mostarda, which cuts into the richness just enough that all the flavors blend together and take you away to heaven. Not even kidding.<br><br>Pan fried shishito peppers -- I was worried this dish would be spicy but it wasn't at all! The exterior is crispy and interior is tender, the peppers are perfectly pan fried and retain an incredible amount of flavor, perfectly complimented by the parmesan, sesame and miso. Seriously, I'm sitting here drooling as I'm thinking about it.<br><br>Wood oven roasted pig face -- hands down, probably the best part of the meal. It was so tender and flavorful and amazing. Not actually a pig's face looking back at you (I don't know why I thought this was the case, but I did), but think more like cabeza meat in Mexican dishes. What with the sunny side egg and the \"potato stix\" (a fancy way to say hash browns), it was like a super succulent breakfast dish.<br><br>Peach and blueberry crumble with honey graham cake and goat cheese gelato -- so glad I only got a taster dish of this as a birthday freebie. I never would've finished the full-size dish as I was already stuffed to the seams from the meal itself. This is a pretty rich dessert because of the gelato, but the crumble and cake help to cut it just enough that you're not overwhelmed.<br><br>Seriously, this is a 5-star place. Come hungry, leave happy. And, honestly, it doesn't really break the wallet for the quality of food that you're getting!

I have never had trout tartare so this was quite a treat--fresh, vibrant, with a hint of tartness.<br><br>Grilled Baby Octopus with guanciale (Italian cured meat--Googled that one), pistachio, beans, and lemon vinaigrette. When our dinner companion, who has a quieter demeanor usually, took a bite, he slammed both of his fists to the table, and screamed \"This is so good!\" For me, this dish represented the genius of the menu. This hodgepodge of ingredients came together and did a lively square dance in my mouth. I can't even begin to describe the magnificence of this dish--every bite was a little different and never ceased to impress me.<br><br>Confit Goat Belly with lobster and crab, goat butter, and fennel. We wanted to be a bit adventurous and also to partake in the namesake of the restaurant so we tried the goat belly dish. This was a nice rich dish with the butter and belly, but was not too memorable for me.<br><br>Wood-Fired Walter's Chicken. I have no idea what was in this dish, but it was spectacular. I usually don't like to order chicken at restaurants but this dish was out of this world. The chicken was tender, moist, and rich with comforting flavors. <br><br>Pig Face. Mmm... with a name like that, how could you not order it?

We opted to wait for inside seating and after about 20 minutes we were able to snag seats at the bar.<br><br>Seating: Reserved seating is obviously the best, but there is also a good amount of first come, first served seating at the bar and you can also order food in the lounge area by the entrance. There are two additional pairs of bar style seating in the back at either end of the kitchen (I believe also first come, first served) that provide a great view of the chefs at work and a bit more privacy than the seats at the main bar.

My friend and I really liked the chili-cheddar butter, malted oil was whatevs. Recommended.<br><br>Wood oven roasted pig face with sunny side egg: A mix of crispy and soft textures, rich and flavorful. Sunny side egg is great on anything! Smaller portion. Would recommend this slightly above the pork shank for flavor and uniqueness.<br><br>Crisp braised pork shank with buttermilk dressing, butternut shiitake and naan bread: You get a lot of tender meat with this dish which literally falls right off the bone! Buttermilk dressing was a little bit like a raunch sauce (good). Naan bread was just perfect, warm and crispy with a soft inside. You'll definitely want to share this with 2-3 people. Recommended.<br><br>Roasted cauliflower: This was maybe the most surprising dish of the evening. The cauliflower was very well seasoned and had a nice peppery flavor. Very hearty and a surprisingly large portion, would also suggest sharing this with 2-3 people.

The slaw it came with was great and provided a creamy texture that was just right<br>- Pan Roasted Halibut: One of my favorite dishes of the meal. The almond butter, soy, and mushrooms had a very unique flavor and texture that I had never tasted before.<br>- Confit Goat Belly: Delicious, and slightly leaner than pork belly.<br>- Wood Roasted Pig Face: My favorite dish.

No explanation, no offer to have a seat at the bar/lounge area because it may be a while and no suggestion to perhaps order a drink while we wait. Luckily, the food made up for the bad first impression. I started off with the ring of fire cocktail, which I enjoyed, but I didn't really think it was spicy at all. On to the dishes. We ordered the johnny apple cheese bread, pan fried shishito peppers, hamachi crudo, escargot ravioli, blackened catfish, crispy beef short ribs, crisp braised pork shank, confit goat belly and caramel corn & malt balls. This was the perfect amount of food for 4 people. We definitely were stuffed to the brim at the end of dinner, but didn't waste much. The johnny apple cheese bread was good, however, they don't provide enough bread to use up all the spread. The shishito peppers were nothing special. Hamachi crudo was really good and had nice contrasting textures. Â The ravioli, catfish and short ribs were all good, but not amazing. The crisp braised pork shank was a very large portion and was very tender. I don't actually like goat, but the confit goat belly was very good, too.

The most overrated was definitely the hamachi and I wouldn't order it again; it was good, especially since it was served with pork belly, but it wasn't all that special. The pig face was just as good as I remembered it, if not better; however the winner of the night was probably the pork shank. Wow. Dressed in buttermilk and served with grilled spring onion kimchee and deliciously pillow-y naan, the meat was so tender and fell right off the bones. I'm salivating just thinking about it. Definitely a must-order.<br><br>As my motto is \"there's always room for dessert\", I of course, ordered dessert. Per our server's recommendation, I got the Rhubarb Shortcake, which was also amazing. Not too sweet and the \"cinnamon toast crunch\" made for a tasty contrast to the horchata tapioca.<br><br>Service was satisfactory and pretty good, considering we were sitting in the lounge area.

Â All of it was bathed in garam masala yogurt. Â  It's okay.<br><br>Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face - You surprisingly don't see a pig's face when they present the dish to you. Â It appears to be pork, probably from the facial region of a pig, with an egg cooked sunny side up, alongside a smattering of other seasonings.. Â This stuff is GOOD. Â It's very rich. Â They added \"potato stix,\" which appears to be an filled potato thing shaped like a thin noodle that adds a lot of crunch to the dish.. Â The texture of this dish is DELECTABLE. Â This dish would be GREAT hungover on a Saturday morning for the yuppie hungover crowd reading this post..<br><br>Desserts<br><br>Sweet Korn Kulfi - This is their take on peanut butter and jelly. Â They have peanut butter ice cream sitting on a wafer-like cookie, with grape jelly surrounding the dish.. Â This is an interesting dessert, and I would recommend it for novelty's sake, but I felt like they could have added more crunch to this to make it better.<br><br>Chocolate Truffle Cake - This is the standard chocolate lover's dessert, with added crunchy texture..

Perfect hint of gamey meat. Could use a kick of some kind.<br><br>Broccoli: 4/5. I love the smoked blue cheese complimenting the broccoli. It gives it mass. However while the stem of the broccoli was crunchy, the rest was rather soggy. Would have been a 5 otherwise.<br><br>The chicken: 5/5. WOW! It takes some serious skills to get a chicken to be that flavored and juicy. This bird was cooked with love....and I'm in love with it!<br><br>Goat belly: 3/5. The goat and lobster combination was daring. However, I felt like there was some cheating in this dish. A lot of the flavor relied on the fat grease taste. It was a little heavy for me.<br><br>Cocktails:<br><br>Best of Three: 3/5 Easy drink to start with. Nice, smooth and citrusy. Goes down fast.<br><br>The Innovator: 5/5 Nice and meaty. Definitely has character. Good Jim beam kick in the beginning with a soothing pear citrusy finish.<br><br>Beauty in the Dark: 5/5 Fun and slightly bubbly. Carries you on a high note throughout. Good to get your taste buds energized for the meal.<br><br>Rebirth of Honest: 4/5 Perfect drink to end the meal with. Nice balance between the bitters and the creme de cacao. Quite overpowering though. A dessert by itself. Wouldn't go well with another dessert dish.<br><br>Desert:<br><br>Doughnut holes: 5/5. I know doughnut holes are inherently delicious but, wow.....

The pork shank was the obvious stand out of the meal. It's tender, HUGE, and comes with a ranch and a buffalo sauce, kind of like an XXL chicken wing (but so much better). <br><br>We recently went back and grabbed a seat in the bar area for drinks and snacks. We had the shishito peppers and ham frites. The frites were good, but pretty classic french fries. I only wish the beer sauce they came with resembled more of a beer cheese, but really it tasted like a lightly flavored aioli. Honestly the roasted tomato aioli that came with it was better. The shishitos, while very good, range in spice, so it's a bit of a Russian Roulette. I'm not one for a lot of spice so once I almost lost my tongue on one pepper, I called it quits, but my husband was happy to finish them off. They have a nice selection of wines and some really interesting cocktails--I was particularly impressed by a bubbly from New Mexico (I didn't even know they made wine).

However, the bread itself was so good that in the end I was glad that the butter was so mild because it allowed me to taste the meaty flavor of the bread. My boyfriend, who is really into bread, really enjoyed it as well.<br><br>Broccoli: SO, SO GOOD. The dish looked deceptively simple but we actually finished the whole plate! There is also a lot of broccoli, by the way. We kept trying to figure out how they made it so deliciously smoky, but we couldn't! The slight tanginess from the blue cheese and the rice krispies added flavor and texture depth. Delicious.<br><br>Trout: another winner! The fish was cooked PERFECTLY with crispy skin on one side. It fell apart when poked with a fork, and we mixed it with the mousse and clams and it was so creamy, yet not overpoweringly rich. Still super decadent though. I was so surprised at how well it meshed with the slight flavor of goat! Another great dish with flavor and texture depth.<br><br>Green beans: simple veggie dish, BUT SO DELICIOUS. I think I was surprised at how tangy the sauce was - you can definitely taste the fish sauce! The beans were also snappy, fresh and juicy so they were a delight to eat. Not sure why the cashews were included though - felt a bit out of place.<br><br>Pig face: favorite dish from the night!

I still can't believe how she got reservations for so many people. Instead dining in the noisy, crowded upstairs area, we were guided downstairs into a private wine room with a huge table. It was an intimate, special place where you could already get a sense of the food you were about to eat. <br><br>We had so much delicious food. I can't even begin to describe. There wasn't a dish that I disliked. <br><br>We started off with assorted breads. The cheddar bread was my favorite, but there was also one with tzatziki sauce and hummus, and another with peanut butter butter and some berry sauce.<br><br>The assorted olives were delicious! Not to salty and a great variety makes me a happy girl. <br><br>A nice refreshing dish is the kohlrabi salad. A perfect combination of crunch and sweetness, I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. <br><br>The grilled sepia is wonderful. The flavors are all there. Another favorite was the chickpea fritter. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I personally love cauliflower, so that dish was amazing for me. <br><br>The goat leg was good-- I've never had goat before-- but I'd rather stick to the rest. I think I may also have been way to full by this point to thoroughly enjoy it. <br><br>Dessert was also yummy. The lemon cake was one of the best I've had. There were so many others I can't even remember. They were all very innovative. One even had goat cheese ice cream. <br><br>Definitely worth the trip and wait.

He's been here a couple of times and knew to make reservations for us on a Saturday night. We were seating almost immediately. It is quite dim and quite loud inside. I was fine with the noise because we were definitely having drinks at dinner and some inebriated bonding time. The restaurant has the feel of a fancier restaurant but also very personable and cozy. It's not pretentious and I liked that. <br><br>What we ordered in the order it was served:<br><br>Bacon gouda bread with butter and romesco - The bread is very tiny, only four slices, but very savory. The romesco was heavenly.<br><br>Goat carpaccio, trout roe, fried capers, olive-maple vinaigrette - Loved the combination of the thinly sliced goat with the vinaigrette dressed greens and fried capers. This plate is smaller and lighter than most on the menu.<br><br>Goat liver mousse, picked rhubarb, blueberry, crumpets - I loved this one even though I am not a big fan of liver. Cut the crumpets in half, spread some goat liver mousse, and top with either pickles of the blueberry spread. DE-LICIOUS.<br><br>Shishito peppers, parmesean, sesame, miso - I'm a big fan of shishito peppers especially when they make it like this at restaurants. However, I thought there was a tad too much parmesan and HOOOOLY SMOKES these were hot! I feel like the really spicy ones are one in a million but I got at least 5 in this little bowl of peppers. We didn't finish half of it because my mouth was on fire and I couldn't taste anything else after.<br><br>Halibut, almond butter, white asparagus & Cauliflower, pickled peppers, pine nuts, mint - These two paired very well together. Tactfully served, guys!<br><br>Pork shank, spring onion kimchee, buttermilk dressing, naan - At this point, my stomach was about to pop. The pork was very tender and went well with everything else. I wish I had more room to eat a couple more bites!!<br><br>It's recommended 2 plate per person. We went with 7 total because the bread and the carpaccio were on the smaller side. The three of us also shared two bottles of white wine (one very acidic one and another Greek wine I really enjoyed). Our server was great and contributed to such an enjoyable dinner atmosphere.

She also knew the menu really well and was eager to give suggestions on what we should order and what not to order. <br><br>We started out with the ham frites, which came out right away.

Â Every type of plate we had here was different and unique; between the stuffed lamb calamari (yum) to the beef ribs with okra over corn on the cob. Â These are all plates that you can't get anywhere else. Â While the signature dish to get is the \"roasted pig face,\" I preferred the braised pork shank. Â The meat on the pork shank basically falls off the bone it's so tender. Â That paired with the bread and sauce is my favorite dish there.<br><br>Don't overlook the vegetable plates though, I know I know, broccoli and green beans are the green vegetables that you would normally avoid as a kid, but I'm telling you the broccoli with cream sauce and the green beans are unlike any other vegetables you've had before, they're seasoned perfectly. Â <br><br>The service here is definitely something to take note of, they came 3 times during our meal to change out our dirty plates to clean ones. Â The service was excellent, I felt like a queen. Â We finished with the butterscotch dessert, it was pretty good but would have been better if it was served warm. Â It's a combination of textures; cake, nuts, and butterscotch pudding with a really great flavor.<br><br>All in all, my favorite restaurant experience from the great service, to the variety of food, to the ambiance.

You see, I had originally made reservations for G&G back in 2010 for March 30th, 2011. My reservation was later cancelled for an unknown private event that they were hosting on that date after my reservation had been taken only by mistake. I worked at a restaurant at the time and though I felt a little sour, I understand how mistakes can happen. Plus I drove by on the night of my B-Day last and found out that the secret private event was the Top Chef finale.... Okay fine, I guess that might be a little more high profile than little ole me... and it only took another year before it all ended up working out. <br><br>Yesterday I was treated to one of the nicest dining experiences I've had in a long time (Thx, Mark S!). Coming from a serving/bartending background, I always appreciate when servers look comfortable at work- ie, super cute goat guy on a thin black tee and jeans. They basically had me at their uniforms, which are pretty damn similar to my everyday attire of a bunch of stuff with animals on it, and nothing to fancy schmancy. <br><br>The food on the other hand... a little more dressed up. Like, I thought I looked nice until I saw what my dinner was wearing. Our server said that for 2 people 4-5 plates is usually plenty... so naturally, we went with 6... and a dessert. Here's the birthday run down:<br><br>- Fresh baked bread with coffee spread = whoa. Whoa-ho-ho. Unbelievable. Eating this reminded me of Halloween time and seeing one of your friends in a costume where you might see them everyday in regular life but in costume they're barely recognizable... and they look so good you can't stop staring and creep them out. It's like that. How could this taste so much like coffee and not like bread or artificial coffee flavoring and why can't I take my mouth of it? And then I start creeping out other diners with my enthusiasm for eating it. By far, my favorite item of the night... and I don't really even like bread. <br><br>- Fresh baked maize bread with avocado yogurt... Daaamn is all you need to know. <br><br>- The famous cauliflower: Parm cheezy and delish. I preferred the bottom bits without the cheese and with the mint leaves, but my cauliflower hatin' counterpart LOVED the cheese and scarfed his portion down and then some with jubilant fervor. <br><br>- Warm marinated olives. Whodathunk olives would taste even better warm? I guess they work on the same level as salted nuts. You MUST get an order of these bad boys to munch on throughout your meal. Plus, a million of them come in an order so it's a nice little time sucker... and they don't forget to provide you with a little pot for the pits so you don't end up with a plate full of spitty, gnawed on pits. <br><br>- Roasted beet salad with crunchy-ness and green bean biz-nast. Okay, obvi that's not what it was actually called but I've been working a lot and sleeping a little so my mind was in a bit of a daze but what I liked about this beet salad, as the world's biggest beet fan, is that it wasn't a bunch of mixed greens with a few beet bits- it was 100% Beet by volume and only had a light sprinkling of mixed greens on top for color. Just beet it? Don't mind if I do. <br><br>- Artichoke... something? I dunno. I just glanced at the menu quickly and when I saw olives, beets, and artichokes (3 of my top 5 favorite foods) I know which plates would be called upon. If I had to describe the artichoke dish I'd say it was like a pasta that looked like individually wrapped candy packets filled with nutty goodness. Hehe... she said 'nutty goodness.'<br><br>To be honest, I didn't really read the full description of anything I ordered. There was so much going on as far as atmosphere and the best playlist ever! Seriously, I think I looked around and at some point in the night, I'm pretty sure every person in there had uttered the word's 'it's like I made this playlist\"... sure you did, buddy. I was thinking the same thing about myself and then while I was looking around I realized that though I LOVED every song, I'm just not nearly cool enough to be able to devise a playlist of that magnitude. It was a scene alright, but still cool enough that you can pull a mix of really dressed up people to really casual peeps and still have everyone feeling comfortable. Then again, it's dark and loud as f*ck so everyone seems about the same level when you've got those two things going. <br><br>And I probably don't have to mention this but I will anyway- the beer list was quality, my Tequila Fleur got my kulo buzzed, and our server was a God damned peach if I've ever seen one. <br><br>It would take a plague of epic proportions to keep this (now 1 year older) Miss away from G&theG for too long. In fact, I actually logged onto Yelp and made my OpenTable reservation while I was only 2 plates into dinner at GG.

I'd like to chalk it up to a combination of mishaps and a bad server, but regardless my evening was a massive disappointment based on all the hype. Myself and my family made this reservation months in advance to celebrate a combination of an anniversary and a birthday, which we had even indicated with our reservation. Needless to say, we went preparing to spend a lot of time and money enjoying ourselves and the restaurant but we did not get that opportunity.<br><br>We were somewhat awkwardly greeted by our server Alex upon our arrival. We needed a few minutes to peruse the menu of course, but when we told her the plates we had picked out, she was quick to ask if that would be enough. I said, \"Why don't we just start with that for round one?\" to which she insisted we tell her what we're considering and that some of our choices would be too similar, then suggested significantly more expensive plates in their stead. We felt incredibly pressured to choose our entire dinner while she impatiently stared at us, so unfortunately, we did. We ordered the green beans, the fried oysters, the pig face, the hamachi crudo, and the goat belly (on special that evening). As our ordering went on, Alex took on a more and more disdainful look and could not have turned on her heel faster once we were done ordering. At this point her attitude already put a horrible taste in our mouths, no pun intended.<br><br>From then on, the food experience itself just sputtered. The green beans came out first, which I thought was a strange choice - while good and full of umami flavor, at the end of the day, they are simply green beans - why bring those with no protein on the table? Shortly thereafter the oysters arrived at our table - four TINY morsels with as much breading as oyster, with one fried caper on each, nestled into a massive bed of what I can only call potato salad. It seriously tasted like supermarket potato salad - no contrast or pop at all - and it completely overwhelmed the oyster. My parents were kind enough to let me have at the extra oyster and the only way to enjoy it was to pull it out of its gloppy potato nest, pry off some of the breading, and get about one second of enjoyment out of what should have been the star. So disappointing.<br><br>I don't think I'd even gotten to the fourth oyster when the pig face was arriving on the table (we are talking the third dish arriving in about five or six minutes since the first). My stepdad had asked for an extra egg which turned out to be a great idea - pro-tip! - because the runny yolk absolutely helps bind the dish together. The pig itself is so fatty and delectable, especially with the maple pairing, that it's not hard to see why this dish is a favorite here. However, based on the description I was really hoping for a pop of the tamarind or cilantro but both were woefully lacking as evidenced by how thinly their sauces were distributed on the plate. Maybe they were overwhelmed by the potato \"stix\", I'm not sure.... But without one of these flavors to set it off, I can really only call the pig face an above average hash.<br><br>Again, while we were not even halfway through this dish came the hamachi crudo, which flavor-wise was the real triumph of the night, though yet again, suffered from what I think was a real issue in proportioning. It came with caper berries, pork belly, micro herbs, and a fantastic chili aioli (though this sauce had no heat whatsoever). The hamachi was of GORGEOUS quality and the accompaniments were well chosen, but simply so sparse in comparison to the amount of fish. The caper berries were already tiny, yet had to be sliced into slivers for all of us to be able to taste them properly in conjunction with the fish and aioli. The pork belly pieces could not have been even a half inch long and there were three on the plate, so again, they had to be cut as small as possible.<br><br>And yet again, while we were still enjoying what had so far been our favorite, the goat belly made its way out to the table, which was by far the richest dish and a worthy way to end the night. While the portion is VERY small (the three of us had about a bite and half each, if that), the flavors are super heavy and indulgent - Â tender confit goat belly, lobster, bourbon butter, and just enough greens to lighten it up... Slight recovery. But as soon as it was done Alex was coming around to ask if we wanted anything else (we didn't) and then hastily brought us the check. Keep in mind we had not even been in the restaurant for 45 minutes at this point - I hadn't even finished my tiny cocktail. Then after the check had already been dropped off she came with a small plate of dessert and the most awkward, \"Happy... happy day\" and fake smile I've ever had to endure. I don't know what we did to earn her disdain but it just capped off a poorly spaced and plated experience.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I happened to have a meeting in the area and thought, why not.

The meat was as tender as oxtail, and the dish was worth the visit alone!<br><br>Grilled Pork Ribs- big meaty ribs with perfect seasoning, this was one of my choices, and it did not disappoint (and I've been all over in Memphis, trust me). <br><br>Goat Carpaccio- Daphers' husband was eyeing the carpaccio on the menu, and it was a great choice. Who doesn't like a carpaccio? Very good.<br><br>Escargot Ravioli- the last of our truly standout dishes was the Escargot Ravioli.

What? I'm a passable cook and I've learned how to saute green beans in coarse ground pepper, Â sea salt and lemon juice or a splash of white wine vinegar too! Nah, not that amazing.<br><br>The drink menu is really stellar and the Firestone IPA paired well to cut through the meat and richness of the sauces. <br><br>I forgot to mention our server on the Sunday night we were there, she was working the bar and lounge area, and was great!

The cheese was subtle and the salad fresh and flavorful. Wouldn't order again though.<br><br>The tortone was house made sourdough with cream cheese and pepita spread. It was solid but it was nothing compared to the onion bread dish which is a brioche bread. It is crispy on the outside kind of like a muffin and combined with the butter and sweet chutney, it was one of my favorites.<br><br>We got the escargot ravioli. And for 15 dollars you only get 4 ravioli which is kind of a bummer. The snails were tender with a nice light chew, and the bacon sauce with wonton crisps on top provided a savory crunch.<br><br>Next came the infamous pig face which was truly like bacon on steroids as another yelper mentioned. It was thicker, softer and more tender than my normal bacon experience. With the egg on top mixed in, it was a winner.<br><br>Final main course dish was the duck tongue. The tongue was cut and fried into small pieces. Each bit was light airy and fried perfectly.

Although they were unable to make me a gin egg white cocktail, which I was dying for I ordered a Thai one on which was an incredible and sweet rum and brandy drink that packed a serious punch. I enjoyed every solitary sip of this cocktail and my friends seemed to be enjoying their as well. <br><br>When we were seated we went through the menu and had to narrow down our choices. The menu is large and diverse and full of delicious sounding items. We picked a bread, an oyster, two veggies, two fish dishes, two meats and a goat dish. I was pumped.<br><br>The johnny applecheese bread was served first with a cheese butter and malt vinegar and arrived warm and fresh to the table. I would lick the cheese out of the dish and order two more loaves of bread. Off to an amazing start. <br><br>Next our oysters arrived, they were fresh tasting and my friends liked them a lot but I just didn't enjoy that they were warm. I would however, absolutely try the other varieties they offer. <br><br>Here is the real sad thing about Girl & the Goat, the veggie dishes are so insanely good that when you finish them and get to the meat dishes, even though you are absolutely stuffed you still want more of that insanely delicious cauliflower. That is a standard and if you don't get it there is something wrong with you. We also had the goat cheese pierogies. Rich and delicious and holy crap yummy. <br><br>Next came the fish dishes. Grilled baby octopus and calamari bruschetta. The octopus had a great cook and rich flavors. The calamari bruschetta was nuts, at this point I was so drunk from yet another strong drink I was enjoying but I can surely remember that the presentation was great and the flavors spot on - a highlight. <br><br>After that we did a \"dual of tongues\" by ordering both the beef and duck tongue dishes. The duck was interesting, cut in strips and fried and the tuna in the dish was spot on, would absolutely order again. The beef tongue I remember being good, but I also can't really remember it, so let's just say it was the miss of the evening.<br><br>Our last savory was the goat belly. I can't even start with this dish. The fat from the belly and then it is literally SWIMMING in a crab, lobster, fennel butter sauce. I would sop this up with that cheese bread and then I would die and go straight to Heaven and BEG for a stair master. Literally one of the most delicious dishes in the entire city of Chicago and I have had some things. <br><br>For our last course we ordered both the pb&j and the seasonal apple dessert. I am telling you, run to get that apple dessert. I ordered a sauterne to go with it and it was the icing on a perfect birthday dinner. oh, and the pb&j was delectable as well. The wait staff is also friendly and the service is prompt. These dishes were a ton of food but also a great amount for a table of 5 people and all and all when split that many ways is a great price.

Mad respect to the executive chef and Top Chef winner, Stephanie Izard. <br><br>We made a reservation 2 days before, and the only time left was 11:45pm on Friday (I didn't know ahead of time how busy this place gets). We decided to walk in on Friday at around 8:50 to see if we'd have better luck. The wait was supposed to be 1 hr 45 min, so we found a seat at the bar. Decided to grab a couple light dishes to start: ham frites and chickpea fritter. Both were very good. We could tell right away this was going to be a good experience. After about 1.5hrs, we got seated. Here's what we got and the order it came out:<br><br>Pan roasted halibut - amazing! Literally every ingredient just melded together and worked so well. We cleaned the plate, including the garnishes. <br><br>Confit goat belly - my first time trying goat. I was hesitant because I don't like gamy meat (like lamb), and I just had this perception that goat would be way to gamy for me. But oh man, this was cooked so perfectly. If you ever want to try goat, this is the place to do it. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. And the garnishes, again, really enhanced the dish.<br><br>Pig face - this was surprisingly my least favorite of the night. Just didn't do it for me. Maybe I don't like eating fat as much as most people here on Yelp). I just can't eat fat. And pig face had a lot of fat. A lot. <br><br>Crisp braised pork shank - this was also very good. Crispy on the outside. Meat just falls of the bone. Came with two sauces, kimchee, and naan. I wish it came out earlier cuz we didn't do it justice. We were so full by now we couldn't finish it. <br><br>Miso-butterscotch budino - what is this and why is it so good? A lot of people were ordering this, and the waiter said it's the most popular dessert on the menu, so we tried it. Wow. So many flavors that worked so well together. Cake, butterscotch, bacon toffee, pineapple, cashew. Perfect blend of sweet, tart, and salt.<br><br>I can easily say this is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to in my life.

We sat within 10 minutes of sitting down. <br><br>The food was nothing short of spectacular- so inventive, unique and flavorful! We tried:<br><br>-Cheese bread with tomato jam and ham butter: the ham butter was one of my favorite parts of the whole meal! If I could spread it on every bread ever that would be ideal. The tomato jam was good acidic addition. <br>-shishito peppers: WOW. Great bang for your buck, a lot of peppers come in an order. The parm and miso work in a way you'd never expect. Some are spicier than others, and it balances out to a great, even heat<br>-chickpea salad: the yogurt dressing contrasts really well with the hot chickpea fritters and crunchy salad<br>-pork shank: pork was unbelievably tender, just falls off the bone. This was the least adventurous of the items we ordered, but the quality is undeniable<br>-ham frites: this is the only thing I wouldn't order again, they're basically fries.

The food portion is small and I mean small. Comparing this dish size to diner's dish size the portion is literally 1/3 of it. If you're going to this restaurant as a party if feels as if everyone takes one bite out of each dish and it's completely gone. The food quality is good, the only thing that really disappointed me was the escargot ravioli. It's a small ravioli with only one small escargot in it and it tasted quite bland. I expected much more flavor. I really recommend the calamari. It was very tasty Â that my family and I devoured it. Another thing I recommend is the sauteed green beans which was also very tasty.

My friend and I went there a month ago, and we really love it. The atmosphere, food, and service were really nice. I am thinking to go there again for sure.<br>I read the about Girl & the Goat on the internet, and people wrote good things about the restaurant. My friends and I got there and we already love the place from outside. The size of the restaurant is not that big but they can fit a lot of people in there. The cool thing was you can sit in front of the kitchen if you'd like. The kitchen is surrounded by clear glasses as a culinary arts student I liked seeing the kitchen from where I sitting. When you walk in the first thing you see is the reception and the bar. I really liked the bar. For example, the background of the bar is all covered with alcohol bottles. The only thing I didn't really about the atmosphere was the lights. It is kind of low and that's what makes the restaurant little bit darker.<br>The system of service is Russian style. The food comes to the middle of the table, so you cannot just order for yourself. That is why people usually order a lot of things so they can taste everything. We ordered a bunch of stuff but my favorites are the duck tongues, crispy beef short ribs, mussels and calamari bruschetta. Â I was in love with their desserts. Their presentation and the taste was amazing. There were four choices and we tried all of them. My favorite was the chocolate mousse. <br>The servers are extremely nice to you, which is awesome. They're very helpful with everything. For example, it was our first time there and we didn't know what to get and he told us which ones are the best ones. He always provided his recommendations. After we ordered our foods, our server brought us olive oil and bread, they were so delicious. Moreover, the service was really fast, I liked how the foods came really fast.<br>I highly recommend everyone to go there. The atmosphere, food, and service are amazing. By the way, we made a reservation a week before we went there because the restaurant is usually packed and it is really hard to find seats without a reservation. Just don't forget to make a reservation before you go, and the price range is from $15 to $30. It can be a very salty check if you go just by yourself or with someone else.

We ordered 7 dishes between two people and we finished everything. We were super stuffed, but super satisfied.

Our server, Hunter, didn't mind at all. Â In fact he encouraged it. The dining experience is mainly tapas (small plates), meant to be shared and enjoyed over time. It is best to start with the lighter fare, and to work your way up to the heartier, meatier dishes. We did just that. <br><br>Our starters were the pan fried Shishito peppers, served with parmesan, sesame and miso and the \"Corny Goat,\" which is French bread served with goat cheese butter and corn relish. Next was the grilled baby octopus, which included guanciale, favas, radish pods, pistachios, and lemon vinaigrette and cofit goat belly, served with bourbon butter, lobster 'n crab, and fennel. So far, so good. We were off to a fine start, and I was already starting to feel satisfied, yet edging towards full. <br><br>Now comes the heavy lifting. We opted for the wood oven roasted pig face, served with a sunny-side egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine maple, and potato sticks. It was tender and flavorful. We also opted for the Pinn Oaks lamb tartare, prepared with sweet corn tapenade, tuna aioli, and water crackers. Although I was on the brink of exploding, I was extremely satisfied and felt very content. I sat back in my chair, closed my eyes, and savored every last bite. To finish our meal, we decided upon the miso-butterscotch budino: bacon toffee, glazed pineapple, and candied cashews, as well as the milk chocolate and galangal napoleon, served with blackberries and passion fruit.<br><br>Throughout our meal, we tried a variety of different drinks: \"Blood and Goats,\" a concoction of Monkey Shoulder Scotch, Leopold Tart Cherry, Savannah Madeira, and orange; \"The Lake Effect:\" Journeyman Rye, FEW Gin, Chrysanthemum Honey Liqueur, and lemon; and \"The Foghorn:\" also FEW Gin, Cocchi Vermouth, Luxardo cherries, and orange bitters. <br><br>My two-month wait time for a reservation was well worth it.

Â The octopus had the grilled crust and flavor, but nice and chewy in a lemon vinaigrette with pistachios and other little tidbits that kind of got lost.

Â It was different with some kind of green sauce (avocado and cilantro puree? that wasn't very flavorful), and some blackberries.

Â The menu says sauteed, but there were some grill marks or some blackening on the tender beans that were cooked in a fish sauce vinaigrette and cashews.

This was so good. The fritters were perfectly fried, and that yogurt sauce is to die for!<br>- Shishito peppers: Also a tad bit heavy, but I loved the flavor of the miso combined w/ the peppers. I probably wouldn't order it again, but it was good.<br>- Diver scallops: Â The flavor was great (uni cream - yum!) and plum lended a nice tartness. The menu didn't mention that this was primarily a pasta dish so we were left wanting a bit more scallop at the end. A great dish though!<br>- Pig's Face: Overall a pretty disappointing dish. The flavor itself was pretty good, but the dish was far too heavy and rich for my liking.<br>- Goat empanadas: One of my favorite dishes that I tried.

They menus are paper menus and you can circle everything you would like to order making it simpler. They also have a small menu with their specials listed.<br><br>What we ordered:<br>1. roasted cauliflower- 2 stars. Pricey appetizer of cauliflower that was burnt. We didn't not enjoy this dish despite all the recommendations by other reviewers. But our cauliflower came out black, crisp, with not much flavor except a burnt charred taste.<br>2. Chickpea fritters- 3 stars. The chickpea fritter was very interesting. It was perfectly fried with a light crispy exterior with the mushy chickpea inside. However, it didn't have much flavor. It was like eating deep fried battered hummus.<br>3. Hamachi Crudo- 4 stars. fresh slices of hamachi along with some fried pork belly. This was a flavorful, fresh, and light appetizer.<br>4. pan seared diver scallops- 4 stars. The scallops were cooked perfectly, nice smooth and silky with lots of flavor. But it was on the salty side.<br>5. NY strip tartare- 4 stars. Overall a great appetizer. The steak was very tender and flavorful. A very simple and delicious dish with complementing textures and flavors to share and start your meal.<br>6. Wood oven roasted pig face- 4 stars. Delicious dish. The egg was cooked perfectly and the pork was tender juicy and very flavorful.<br>7. Crisp braised pork shank- 4 stars. Also a very delicious dish. The pork shank was very tender. The kimchee butternut squash was our favorite though, very creative with a nice crunchy texture and pickled perfectly. Artistically put together, this dish was one of the highlights of our meal.<br>8. Johnny Applecheese bread- 5 stars. Handsdown DELICIOUS!!!!! I highly recommend this dish. We were fighting for every crumb. Perfectly baked bread with amazing flavor and soft fluffiness on the inside with a great crunchy crust. It comes with chili cheddar butter and malted oil, both were delicious. I preferred the chili cheddar butter though. Very different and unique.<br>9. confit goat belly- 3.5 stars. We had to order a goat dish. We wanted the goat leg but they were out. So sad. So we went with the goat belly. The goat belly was delicious, but they only give you a little bit. It can be salty if eaten by itself. But it came with good size pieces of lobster and crab. But it really was like appetizer sized.<br><br>Their food was good, some dishes more so on the saltier side. However, the portions are like tapas and on the pricier side. We had a party of 5 and none of us left full, but it kept us satisfied for a few hours.

I booked probably 2 months ahead, and got a time near their dinner opening on Friday night. At around 4:15 (opening time is 4:30), I saw that they already had people lined up outside who were hoping to get seats without having a reservation. It looked like they were successful, so if you don't have a reservation, I recommend you go during non-peak hours for sure. <br><br>The food was awesome. I love how they crafted their menu items to be moderately-sized dishes (for the most part) that you share with the rest of your group. This lets you sample quite a few things on their menu. <br><br>Our waiter told us to not forget the veggies, as their veggie dishes are really excellent. We tried to get the chickpea fritters, Â it were told that the tasting of that dish that happened at 4 pm before the restaurant opened pushed the timing of the dish back such that it wouldn't be ready until 9 pm that evening, or perhaps not at all. I thought that was a pretty good move for the restaurant, not wanting to serve a dish that they didn't think was perfect. We ended up getting the roasted cauliflower -- and whoa, I have never been impressed with cauliflower before in my life until that dish came out! <br><br>We heard good things about the wood oven roasted pig face, which ended up being pretty good, although very heavy. I would have liked a little more of the tamarind or perhaps something more citrus-y to cut through the heaviness. Although the dish was not large, I felt very full even just after a few bites. Our waiter came by and mixed the dish up for us when he say they we weren't doing so enough, which was also nice. <br><br>Finally, we got the goat neck, which we were told ahead of time was a large dish so we didn't need to order much more after that. That was definitely a correct statement -- I never though goat necks were that big! But it was a really good part of the goat which I had not tried before. The meat was super tender, and just came right off with your fork. They prepare the near over a multi-day period and it comes out super rich, a little smokey, but not at all dry. The flavor is excellent, and the sauces paired with it are awesome as well. The vegetables on the bottom kind of got lost with the huge goat neck on top of it, and I would have liked a few more veggies in general. We ended up having to take some goat neck back home with us, and we left with several suggestions from our waiter about awesome goat neck leftover dishes. <br><br>Overall, an excellent experience. It seems like their menu changes pretty frequently, because a lot of the dishes mentioned in other posts were not on the menu when we were there.

This place is extremely busy and for good reason, the food was outstanding! (I'll get to that in a minute). If you only have a small group I would recommend walking in sometime around 6 PM and asking for a table. You will likely be told that there is a 1.5 to 2+ hour wait which is to be expected, however the actual wait time based on my experience and some other locals I had spoken with was considerably less (half the estimate). In addition, the planed wait time will allow you to walk right across the street to the Highly reviewed Lonely Wolf Bar to sit down and Sample some of their excellent cocktails while you wait. Â Don't worry, Girl & the Goat will text you when your table is ready and your blood alcohol levels will be pre-primed for the experience!<br><br>Now onto the important part, the food...<br><br>Because I was dining alone (I cleverly evaded my colleagues' typical business trip steak dinners) I decided to splurge on three of their top-rated dishes. Each one of them was unique, complex, and beyond impressive. Â Here are my thoughts on each:<br><br>Wood Oven Roasted Pigs Face:.<br><br>Even during my preliminary research the thought of pigs face in a dish admitting only made my stomach turn. I have been to many pig roasts and I'm not a freak that generally eats the face and eyes the roasted pig (although I will grab at the rest of the pig like a crazed zombie). Â This dish easily surfaced as my favorite throughout my meal. As you can see in the countless photos on yelp the pig faces is served topped with a fried egg. The flavor of the warm yoke blends with the fat in the slice of pork so well I having trouble putting it into words... Add tamarind, cilantro, and red wine-maple; Â It was heavenly. Â Just order it. Â No more questions please.<br><br>Pan Roasted Halibut:<br><br>The halibut was outstanding, initially slightly salty and quickly transitioned into spicy and sweet with marcona almond butter, white asparagus, blueberry nuoc cham, The ginger,and the mushrooms just added to the variety. It was incredibly complex and delicious. I would order this again in a heartbeat. Â <br><br>Grilled Baby Octopus:<br><br>The baby octopus dish was served with fava beans, pea, pistachios and a lemon vinaigrette. Â I LOVED the use of the fava beans In this dish. I have ordered octopus countless times over the years in many countries and this was easily the most unique presentation I have encountered. Very good.<br><br>If I could add a + to the end of my 5 stars I would. Â A meal like this in New York City would easily have cost double the price. Follow my advice, walk in, reserve a table, and go get drinks across the street while you wait for a text message.

The cauliflower was also extremely good, with great flavor and a little spice. The goat belly was tasty, with a sweet flavor and good texture. It was interesting paired with the lobster meat, I wouldn't have thought those two proteins would go together, but it worked. The lamb ribs were more disappointing.

When planning out our trip to Chicago, I was most excited to try this place since I'm a big fan of tapas style restaurants. It was our last night in Chicago and we walked almost 2 miles just to try out this place. The place itself is beautiful and it reminds me of rustic/hipster restaurants in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY. Overall, I thought the food was okay but it didn't \"WOW\" me. Our waitress recommended 2 dishes per person and we did just that and we left very full. We ordered the Chili Shrimps, Kalbi Beef Ribs, Pierogi, and the Halibut. I think the halibut was my favorite dish because the fish was very delicate and cooked perfectly with assorted mushrooms on top. The pierogi were more like empanadas with potato cream fillings garnished with pickled corn and carrots. The Kalbi were very fatty pieces and also very salty. The chili shrimps were surprisingly mild in flavor and lacks the spicy kick in chili. Also, did anyone notice that there were no goat dishes on the menu? I was excited to try goat dishes...but I guess I'll have to try it elsewhere.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "A close friend of one of my classmates was in town, and we wanted to take him somewhere special in Chicago for the night.

I've heard that people have had to get reservations months in advance so I guess we just got super lucky.<br><br>I immediately liked the rustic/country feel of the restaurant, and I was impressed with the good service. Our waitress told us that for four people, we should order between 8 and 10 dishes. However, being poor med students and not too terribly hungry, we decided on 6 - two appetizers and one dish selected by each of us. This turned out to be the right amount. We followed the style of sharing the dishes family style, but some of them were seemed hard to share just given their structure. We tried:<br><br>1. Crisp Braised Pork Shank<br>2. Wood Fired Walter's Chicken<br>3. Seared Tuna<br>4. Spring Onion Pot Stickers<br>5. Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face<br>6. Ham Frites<br><br>We tried to decide on a favorite dish but couldn't really agree because they were all so delicious. If I had to choose a personal favorite, it would have to be the Pork Shank.

Â A dense bread with robust blue cheese flavor, carmelized onions and I believe a bacon jam. Â I generally despite onions, but I could not get enough of this bread or the onions & jam.<br><br>Pork Belly. Â The size of the dish was deceiving as it was the most \"artistic\" looking of the bunch. Â Our waitress recommended it when we told her that we like sushi. Â Every ingredient in all of the dishes are chosen intentionally and you could really taste it with the pork belly.<br><br>Goat Empanadas. Â How do groups of more than two share these? Â These were my favorite dish. Â It's a good \"starter\" dish for anyone who is fussy about their food. Â Basically it is goat meat (which isn't at all gamey or weird) in an empanada crust.<br><br>Pig Face. Â So crunchy, so flavorful! Â I will never look at a pig's face the same again. Â When served, it is not actually on the pig's head, so the faint of heart need not worry. Â It's just another part of the pig, and quite possibly the BEST part.<br><br>Cauliflower.

Just make sure you secure a reservation well in advance, otherwise you will be mad dogging those at the crowded bar area to quickly finish up and leave, as I unabashedly did.<br><br>I tried two items on the menu. The first was the delightfully complex Kona Kampachi Crudo. The raw fish was light and refreshing, but when paired with crisp pork belly, it became a delicious play on surf and turf. The contrast in flavors, textures, and temperatures was amazing. The chili aoili added spice and richness, the pickled caperberries provided just the right amount of acidity, and the bread crisps gave the dish another layer of texture.<br><br>The second item I tried was none other than the Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face. After seeing Anthony Bourdain eat this on The Layover, I knew I had to order it. But to be honest, the dish was little more challenging than I thought it would be. The pig face was really intense, gamy even. The trio of sauces -- tamarind, red-wine maple, and cilantro -- helped to offset the pungent flavor of the meat, but I found the first two a tad sweet, even when mixed up with the glorious yolk of the fried egg on top. Finally, the fried potato sticks added much needed texture. I loved it for its bold (dare I say, in your face?) exoticism, but the sheer decadence of this dish makes it one to share and not hog to yourself.<br><br>The decor is very hip and modern, and the service was what one might expect from such a red hot spot -- a little vain, a little aloof, a little haughty.

Â This is the only way to eat bread.<br>- Roasted Pig Face - crispy, amazing fatty flavor (but it got kind of boring after a few bites; better to be shared with 4 or more people)<br>- Wood Grilled Broccoli - the broccoli was INSANE.

The green beans were also good. <br><br>There is sauce on everything, which normally is great. But then they don't bring fresh plates after each \"round\" unless you ask for them.

Our experience was very positive, the tables were all occupied but it didn't feel stuffed like some places get. The decor was nice as well, it was modern without being pretentious. The lighting was dimmed but reasonably and the tables are well lit so you have no trouble seeing the menu or food as with some establishments. The staff was great, they knew the menu and did an excellent job describing and recommending from the selection.<br><br>We started off with a couple breads that were nice and warm, one of which had a mushroom butter that melted wonderfully. Next we had the hamachi crudo with crispy pork belly, pan fried shishito peppers, and the kusshi oysters. The crudo was fresh and went well with the pork belly, and the peppers while not spicy had a nice smokey flavor that married perfectly with parmesan. The oysters weren't bad but I couldn't taste what it was served with, possibly due to the smokey peppers I had just eaten. Next up was the wood oven roasted pig face and the lamb ribs. I like how the pork, egg, and potato stix all come together when mixing it all up. The crunchiness, soft egg, and savory flavor made for a nice combination. The lamb ribs were very tender and moist, and the fat wasn't excessive or off-putting which can happen with some lamb rib dishes. <br><br>The sauteed green beans with fish sauce vinaigrette was cooked perfectly with the perfect amount of sauce, not to mention served in a hefty portion for sharing. What I thought was excellent was the buffalo stye pork shank, it was one of the few dishes I've had that attempted to capitalize on the popularity of 'buffalo style' and successfully hit the mark. The naan was soft, sauce was flavorful and not overbearing, and the pork had the fried texture you would expect without becoming too dry. Our server was nice enough to tear the shank apart for us too for easy sharing. Our final dish was the confit goat belly with bourbon butter and lobster and crab. We liked the taste but honestly expected a larger portion. The goat belly seemed more like typical goat meat than belly, but having never had goat belly our expectations were based on pork belly. <br><br>We finished things off with two desserts and two cheeses, and our server was kind enough to bring an extra dessert with a lit candle after my mom spilled the beans about it being my birthday. The cheeses were Kunik-Pasteurized Goat and Dunbarton Blue-Raw Cow, the blue was really mild with few veins. I highly recommend any of their cocktails, each of us ordered something different and they were all worthy of repeating. <br><br>Apart from the difficulty of getting a reservation and the limited portions of some dishes I found Girl and the Goat to be a definite hit.

I cannot begin to tell about each experience or plate we have had so many. We have had intimate two person dinners, family dinners and birthday parties.

Their wait staff has always been insightful in explaining any changes to the menu and making recommendations. I also like how they stagger the dishes and time them perfectly throughout the experience. They have a food service system that works despite the obvious, they are always slammed. <br><br>Over our visits a few of the dishes had remained on the menu, they are just so good! My overall favorite I get every time are the SautÃ©ed Green Beans! I just cannot get enough of the warm beans marinated in the flavorful fish sauce. I also recommend the Shishito Peppers and the Chickpea Fitters. They are fun dishes to share with the table (or keep for yourself!). <br> <br>My boyfriend and I usually stick to the fish dishes on the menu because he does not eat meat. As these change all the time I cannot specifically list the best here. However, we have never had a dish we did not like. I do eat meat, however, and feel it a duty to try some of Stephanie's interesting meat creations. I have tried the pig face (pig cheeks) and a pork belly dish. As expected, no complaints from me!<br><br>Depending on how hungry we are we always try at least one of the bread and butter pairings, many times we cannot make up our mind and just get all three. <br><br>On to dessert, just order dessert! I had one of the best desserts I've ever had at G&G. It has been on the menu twice and if it ever reappears, get it! (a dark flowerless chocolate brownie with caramel and topped with shitake mushroom gelato (yes shitake mushroom). The flavors worked so well together it was amazing). I asked for this dessert once when it was off the menu and the staff checked in the back and at least brought me some leftover shitake gelato. Â Score!<br><br>Last, G&G also has a knowledgeable revolving beer menu for the craft beer geek in our group and a nice wine list for the more refined.

The set up of the restaurant is smaller sized plates that you can share amongst your group, having four people was perfect because it allowed us to try lots of different dishes. Was impressed with everything, but three really stood out to me that are MUST HAVES: crisp braised pork shank, calamari bruschetta, and roasted cauliflower. The pork shank was one of the most tender pieces of meat I've ever had and was literally falling off the bone; along with the dressing and naan, the dish was out of this world. The calamari bruschetta was perfection; baguette with a goat milk ricotta and the most amazing grilled calamari to top it off. The roasted cauliflower was just ridiculous; doused in a bread crumb butter (we actually loved this dish so much that we ordered a second round).

However, I think there are some serious issues with their allergy menu philosophy. The gluten-free menu was a version of the regular menu with a bunch of asterisks that basically mean they have gluten in them (took a few trips to the kitchen to figure it out). Might be fine for people with a mild sensitivity, but it's depressing to see a majority of dishes have malt vinegar and soy sauce on a gluten free menu (both are solidly not gluten free). It seems clear they did their gluten free menu as a sop to fad dieters and not to serve people with actual dietary needs, and have not trained the staff on food allergens. On the plus side, the gluten free bread they brought out was good.<br><br>My expectations my have been unrealistically high.

Â I would highly recommend you to make reservations to avoid the long lines and ensure yourself a table, especially if it is for a larger party. Â I came here with a party of five on a Wednesday evening. Â The dim overhead lighting and wooden furniture gave off a rustic vibe.<br><br>The rotating menu is separated into three sections: vegetables, seafood, and meats. Â The food is served family style, so the server recommended about 8-10 dishes for our party to share. Â We decided on: <br><br>Fried Pickles: served with shallot aioli and yuzu harissa sauce. Â The pickles were not overly breaded, so you still have that crunch and sourness from the pickles. Â If prefer a more citrus and creamy texture, dip it in the shallot aioli. Â But if you want a more of a spiciness and tartness to your pickles, go ahead and use the yuzu harissa sauce. Â  Â  Â <br><br>Sauteed Green Beans: dressed up with fish sauce vinaigrette and topped off with cashews. Â This is definitely one of the top dishes I had tried here. Â The green beans were cooked perfectly, so they still had that crunchiness to them. Â The sauce they used must have been crack because none of us could stop eating them.<br><br>Goat Empanadas: on top of marinated sheep feta, pickled golden beets, and tzatziki sauce. Â The goat meat wasn't gamey at all, but rather really tender. Â The cheese, beets, and tzatziki sauce gave off a creamy texture to the whole entrÃ©e.<br><br>Wood Fired Wiley Point Oysters: topped with horseradish, bacon, and preserved lemon. Â I didn't eat this entrÃ©e due to allergies, but my friends did. Â They weren't a big fan of it only because the oysters were warm. Â I guess raw and warm oysters don't go well together.<br><br>Kona Kampachi Crudo: accompanied with crisp pork belly, chili aioli, and caperberries. Â The presentation on this dish was amazing, as well as the taste. Â The kampachi was really fresh and had a really smooth texture to it. Â I was a little worried that pork belly would overpower the taste of the fish, but it didn't. Â It just gave the whole dish that extra crunch.<br><br>Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face: tamarind, cilantro, red wine-maple, and topped off with a sunny side egg and potato stix. Â Oh my, I think I would have to say this is the best tasting dish of the night. Â Everything about this dish was on point. Â You pretty much have to break the egg and mix everything together. Â The pork was really tender that it just melted in your mouth. Â There wasn't enough of this dish to go around.<br><br>Braised Beef Tongue: served mixed with masa, beef vinaigrette, and salsa verde. Â I never had beef tongue so I have nothing to compare it with, but the tongue was really tender. Â There were so many different textures and flavors incorporated in this dish: crunch from the masa, spice and smoothness from the salsa, and a touch of sourness from the vinaigrette. <br><br>Grilled Skirt Steak: served with a root vegetable salad drizzled with cajeta. Â This wasn't the best tasting steak in Chicago, but it was still good. Â The steak was cooked beautifully at a medium rare. Â I also like the touch of sweetness from the cajeta.<br><br>Overall, my experience here was amazing. Â The Girl & The Goat is definitely worth the wait and the hype. Â The server here was really attentive and knowledgeable about everything on the menu. Â He always had a smile on his face and didn't let the busy environment frazzle him. Â The food here was remarkable. Â There are so many different flavors and textures that will tickle your taste buds. Â If you are on the fence about giving this place a try, just take the leap.

I tried making a reservation one month in advance, only to realize that it was already fully booked, except for the 11 PM time slot. Seeing as I'm typically sound asleep by then, we decided to just try our luck at 4 PM on a Friday. It was raining, and the hostess graciously let us wait inside before their official opening time. Before I knew it, my name was called, and I felt like I had won the lottery. <br><br>We were seated at a communal table facing the kitchen, which I appreciated because we could see our dishes being prepared. The space was dimly lit, which makes it difficult to take any food pictures, but creates an intimate atmosphere. We ordered the green beans, goat belly, and pig face. <br><br>The green beans dish was HUGE. It had a strong Asian influence to it, maybe fish sauce? The two of us barely finished half of this dish, and I definitely tried, since I needed my daily serving of veggies. My boyfriend asked me if we should offer some to our table companions, but I thought that might be creepy, so we refrained. <br><br>The goat belly was one of their specials that night. I was worried that it would be too heavy, but it was surprisingly refreshing, and didn't taste fatty at all. <br><br>The star of the show was the pig face (which our waitress assured us would not look like an actual face- phew). It was served on a bed of crispy potatoes, topped off with a fried egg and a mysterious green sauce. We were told to chop it all up, mix it together, and get a little bit of everything in each bite. Â I know this dish has been raved about plenty, but OH MY GOD I can't even begin to explain the flavor explosion that took place in my mouth. The pork was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and combined with the runny yolk and the texture of the potatoes, reached absolute perfection. There's this scene from Ratatouille where the grumpy food critic takes a bite of ratatouille and is immediately taken back to his childhood memories. Strangely enough, I was reminded fondly of my mom's Chinese braised pork dish.<br><br>There was no way we were passing up on dessert. Our server recommended the miso butterscotch budino with no hesitation. It was layered with cashew cake, bacon toffee, miso butterscotch pudding, pineapples, and whipped cream. The pudding was at the bottom, which I didn't realize until after a couple bites in, but it elevated the dessert from great to phenomenal. <br><br>Food, service, and atmosphere were on point.

As a result, the reviews are a little all over the place, and generally depend on one thing: expectations. <br><br>The Girl and the Goat is NOT a fancy restaurant. It's a modern, open-kitchen machine that turns out small plates/tapas-style for tables to share. If you're up for a loud night of cocktails and sampling with a group of friends, this is a perfect place to go. If you're looking for excellent food to impress a significant other, I probably wouldn't go here unless your date is a sucker for creative foods. It's loud. Very loud. Even at midnight when the doors shut and prevent further patrons from entering! We got our reservations on Open Table about 6 weeks in advance after I had stalked the website for awhile. I think going at 4pm is also another viable option for procuring some space.<br><br>I'm surprised by the reviews that purport that flavor was lacking in these dishes. To me, the unique and powerful flavors were the hallmark of this food. Every dish had a very distinctive flavor profile that was unusual in some way -- and most of it worked, although on one dish it didn't. As for each dish:<br><br>Pig face: slow-cooked pig cheek, and it was very good. It's basically a glorified roast pork. But the best part about the pig face was the little fried potato straws and the fried egg on top. The textures came together in a wonderful, crunchy, mushy way that I really enjoyed. This is definitely a dish worth getting. On the salty side.<br><br>Roasted Cauliflower: Roasted and slightly carmelized cauliflower tossed with heaps of parmesan cheese, olive oil, pine nuts and mint. Mint!! This really gave the vegetable an unexpected kick, and those dainty pine nuts knocked it out of the park. The downside to this was that it was swimming in oil. It was way too greasy. Gives me great ideas for making cauliflower at home.<br><br>Squash blossom: A hollowed out piece of squash stuffed with crabmeat, dipped in tempura and flash fried. Of course, delicious. Lacking body in flavor though. The filling was kind of bland. Texture was great. Only two pieces in a serving. Wouldn't necessarily order it again.<br><br>Goat confit: Strange combination of confit goat belly (small piece, preparation similar to the pig's face, slow-cooked), lobster, ginger and some other bright citrus/cilantro flavor that didn't quite work in the end. Enjoyed the goat belly itself, but thought that the accompaniments detracted from the main attraction. Maybe they are afraid people won't be used to the strong flavor of goat?<br><br>Butterscotch budino: Probably the best dessert I've ever had. GET IT!! Even if you're full, just get it. It's so light and refreshing. Light-as-air whipped Italian custard with cinnamon, carmelized cashews, butterscotch sauce and pineapple chunks. It was incredibly refreshing and the mix of creamy, tart, crunchy and sweet were perfect.<br><br>Overall, we enjoyed our meal at Girl and the Goat. I didn't enjoy the fact that it was a loud machine.

I don't usually dine at the bar because it can be cramped, but my wife sat next to a huge wooden pillar so that meant only my side was met with another tush. The major pro of eating at the bar was the quick, attentive and lovely service. We never had to wait for anyone to come to our table, take our drink order, leave, come back, etc. It was brilliant! Loved it! Might even do it again!!!<br><br>The food lived up to every standard I heard of G&TG. Except one dish... the roasted cauliflower. Seriously. How can roasted cauliflower be so freaking DELICIOUS??!! It's a bulbous bland bunch of white.... that exploded with flavor bite after bite. Other standouts included the octopus (so tender!), corny bread and empanadas. The skate wing was in a too-rich-for-my-blood cream sauce, but wifey loved it. The only downfall for her, though, was the SURPRISE! chili flakes nestled between some bites... being that she doesn't do spice, it was an assault on those tender taste buds, so some time had to pass before she could resume the good chow.<br><br>I definitely recommend Girl & The Goat.

The bar was nice and the service was good so it was no problem. Like I said, I've been wanting to come here for a while, so I had big expectations for this place. Overall the food was really good, but not as amazing as I had expected. <br><br>Steamed west coast mussels: 5/5 Â My only complaint is that they give you 2 little pieces of bread and there's so much delicious sauce to soak up! We tried asking for more bread but they won't just give you a few slices, they make you purchase one of their specialty breads.<br><br>Goat blue bread: 5/5 Although originally a little upset we had to purchase more bread for our mussels, it was worth it. The fig butter it came with was delicious and creamy...I might have even taken a few small spoonfuls of it when the bread was gone<br><br>Escargot ravioli: 2/5 Super disappointed with this one. I normally like escargot but whatever was in this made it literally taste like dirt. Avoid this dish. Â <br><br>Sauteed green beans: 5/5 Â SOOO GOOD! If all vegetables were this good I'd be a vegetarian<br><br>Pig Face: 4/5 Flavorful dish that you mix up like a hash<br><br>Goat shank: 4/5 Tender and fell right off the bone", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "All I can say is wow!

The empanadas were my favorite dish of the evening and I loved the tzatiki sauce that they were served with.<br><br>Additionally one of the best parts of the meal was being able to sit at the Chef's Table and talk to the chefs as they prepared our fabulous meal. <br><br>Finally, the service was fantastic and it only made an already great experience better.

The sugo was tasty, but not much different from a regular ragu sauce. The mussels were just...mussels. Sauteed green beans surprisingly probably the best thing we had. Chickpea fritter was definitely solid, but just like anything similar on Devon Street. Duck tongues...what can I say? First time with duck tongues. Didn't hate 'em.

Â The texture of the entire dish was perfect.<br><br>Chickpea fritters- a MUST GET at this restaurant- it's this creamy hummus-like inside fried in a crispy batter on top of a tomato stew with fresh green chickpeas, sliced pickles and mozzarella.<br><br>Goat Cheesecake- DELICIOUS. Â It was a simple deconstructed cheesecake with a circle of creamy, light cheesecake, on top of a delicious graham cracker crumble with caramel sauce and roasted beets. Â <br><br>Roasted cauliflower- great mix of cauliflower, mint, and pine nuts. Â I'm a sucker for any cauliflower dish but they made it really well here. Â I loved the addition of the pine nuts and the hint of sweet mint.<br><br>Kohlrabi salad- a mix of greens, thin slices of kohlrabi (like white radish) and almonds. Â My friend said she thought they put too much dressing on the salad, and I would agree, but it was really good and a unique dish- very refreshing, loved the crunchy almonds.<br><br>Grilled octopus- this dish was a bit salty for my taste since it had guanciale (like prosciutto) it just made it a bit too salty for me.

It's a trendy restaurant with a good drink menu in addition to the food menu. Â I really wanted to like this place more. <br><br>Goat Ribs - brined till the texture of corned beef and extremely salty. I enjoy the nuttiness of the sauce and the radish slaw that accompanied it. It would have been so great if the saltiness level was brought down a few notches.<br><br>Duck Tongue Salad - I like the combination of the flavors; it's bright and fun. While other components were perfectly seasoned...Duck tongue was SO SALTY. The duck tongue was also really greasy... and then in combination of the fried wonton stripes.. it's like having 2 types of greasy croutons in one dish. I enjoy the flavors of this dish, but can only do a couple spoonfuls at a time.<br><br>Goat Liver Mousse - my favorite out of all the items. It is served with these fluffy buttered biscuit like bread along with blueberry compote and a couple of house picked vegetables. It's an elevated version of the biscuit with grape jelly you'd see often in a southern meal. If the biscuit (or the butter on it) was less salty, I can probably eat the whole platter myself. <br><br>Roasted Cauliflower - pretty good. combination of mint and cheese on roasted cauliflower worked well; pickled pepper helped cut through the greasiness of the dish. Pine nuts didn't add much to the dish, though.<br><br>Roasted Pig Face - :( I LIVE for big pieces of braised fatty pork with skin on.. but I just didn't like the combination of this one. The pork was very mildly seasoned (especially comparing to how salty their other dishes are); I don't know how they cooked it.. but there was no longer any distinction between the skin, the fat, or the meat. When you bite into it, the whole thing just becomes liquid fat in your mouth, and then you get more greasiness from the super skinny potato sticks... it was hard to swallow or take a second bite. The maple balsamic sauce could have helped to brighten the flavor and cut through the grease, but there was so little of the sauce on the plate. <br><br>Overall, a lot of the dishes we tried are overly salted and very heavy. But then again, this may have be a strategy to get the customers to drink more wine/beer. Service and atmosphere is A++, food is a B-. Portions are really decent for sharing with a few friends.

Â Sooo over the simple roasted variety tossed with arugula, the crunchy beans add the PERFECT amount of texture to a superb salad.<br><br>Goat liver mousse with pickled rhubarb, orange marmalade, and crumpets. Â Effing RIDICULOUS made-fresh-to-order buttery baked crumpets fork-split for THE.MOST.SCRUMPTIOUS mousse you will EVER taste...like EVER!

Â The perfect late-night snack after clubbing and Chicago shenanigans.<br><br>Sweet corn goat cheese wontons with sungold, apricot, ratatouille. Â This dish was my least favorite since I half expected an actual Chinese wonton to come out instead of high end ravioli.

Â Now biting into this duck salad brought back nostalgic memories for me bite after bite.

Â OMG look at that honkin' piece of shank and tell me you're not instantly salivating at the sight! Â About the size of a man's fist, the tender meat literally fell off the bone as our server broke it down tableside for us to enjoy. Â Meant to be sandwiched between the baked naan with a bit of tangy Korean slaw, creamy buttermilk dressing, and a hint of red buffalo sauce, the balance of smoky ranch flavors made for the most gluttonous dish of the night!

Dish. <br><br>In 3 words, the meal can be described as: Heavy...but delicious.<br><br>Friday 4:30pm reservation. 5 dishes + 1 bread. <br><br>1) Not Campbells bread - served with this creamy mushroom soup butter + tart tomato soup oil, which were equally loved. The bread of the day was actually broccoli cheese soup, with EVERYTHING baked INTO the bread itself. Holy god. Hot fluffy bread with a nice crust but flavorful and moist. Grade: A. <br><br>2) Sauteed green beans - The creamy fish sauce dressing was a nice touch, which made the perfectly sauteed green beans uber unique...if only it wasn't SO salty and heavy. The \"fattiest\" beans I've ever tasted in this lifetime. Grade: B.<br><br>3) Seared Scallops - 2 big scallops over a (finally!) light sauce with veal and almond butter, which I didn't taste at all. The scallops were perfectly seared and the sauce complemented it perfectly. Grade: A-.<br><br>4) Steamed clams - The saltiest blackbean sauce clams I've ever eaten. I was LEAST impressed with this dish because i believe fresh clams should be cooked in a lighter sauce. The flavor should sing without many bells and whistles. Unfortunately, these clams were drowned in a saltwater bath. Grade: B-. <br><br>5) Crisp soft shell crab - Loooooved These. The legs were crunchy, light fried crispy. The body of the crab was so juicy, soft and tender. Served over a delicious creamy curry-flavored sauce. To die for. Grade: A+. <br><br>6) Grilled baby octopus - Another hit!! Loved Stephanie Izzard's combination of vegetables with the nicely grilled baby octopus. A bowl of fun, fresh flavors that perfectly complement the star = octopus!!! Grade: A. <br><br>One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago = Up there with MK and Graham Elliot!! <br><br>I was majorly impressed with the flavors and the great service. Stephanie Izzard deserves her Top Chef win!!! <br><br>Last words - This restaurant is perfect for a date.

I am not generally a cauliflower lover, but these were seasoned perfectly and a bit spicy.<br><br>Roasted beets - we had these without the anchovies, because we were dining with a vegetarian. The crunchiness of the breadcrumbs really added something.<br><br>Chickpea fritters - delicious. Fried perfectly and not greasy at all. The texture was almost tofu-like. Highly recommend these.<br><br>Grilled baby octopus - this was the table's favorite. I loved it as well, but I felt that the mustard taste (must have been mustard greens?) came on slightly too strong.<br><br>Duck tongues - absolutely amazing. The duck tongues were fried and crispy. They were combined with raw tuna and black beans. Oddest combination, but amazing.<br><br>Beef tongue - the beef tongue itself was cooked perfectly, but I thought it was too much with the masa. I thought the masa paired well with the salsa verde, and the tongue paired well with the salsa verde, but the tongue and the masa were too much together.<br><br>Wood fired wellfleet oysters - the only thing I thought was mediocre. Wouldn't recommend these.<br><br>Goat loin with salsify and kumquat - the goat was perfectly cooked at medium rare. The jus was perfect and I thought the salsify was a great match. I thought the kumquats overpowered the goat and salsify, but I think that's a personal thing, because I always feel kumquats overpower whatever they are in.<br><br>Sticky date cake - delicious.

Â I had a long, draining week and after 3 months, the one thing I was looking forward to was dinner at Girl & The Goat. Â Luckily, another friend came to the rescue and I'm so happy she did.<br><br>First of all, I had the pleasure of meeting Chef Izard shortly after she was announced as the Top Chef winner. Â She came into Whole Foods and instead of being calm, cool and collect, I stopped working and walked right up to her and started babbling. Â I don't even know what came over me, but you know what? Â She was one of the nicest people I've ever met. Â She laughed, chatted and was extremely down to earth. Â This was refreshing, as a few people who know me know which other \"big chef\" I've run into numerous times that I cannot stand. Â Regardless, I've been wanting to come here since before it even opened....and then once it opened, well, I was just really lazy and couldn't find anyone to go.<br><br>Fast forward to a few weeks ago. Â Our server was lovely. Â She was patient and funny and explained everything in detail. Â When she suggested 4 plates total, I kind of scoffed at the idea, because I wanted to try so many things, but even 4 plates was a little too much. Â Then again, we ordered the \"Not Campbells\" bread, but by the time the 3rd item came out, we were nearly stuffed. Â <br><br>Here's why I should have written everything down...I cannot remember the 1st plate we shared. Â It was a fish of some sort with crispy pork on top and caper-something. Â Everything about it was perfect. Â The flavors complimented each other nicely and those caper-somethings (not capers, I know that much) were not over powering in the slightest, just like our server promised.<br><br>The next dish was shishito peppers with parmesan and, something. Â (See, this is why I should not be allowed to review places, my vocabulary becomes non-existent). Â This was a little bowl that seemed endless. Â I'm not even joking. Â We ate MAYBE 1/3 of it and had to stop because we had 2 more dishes coming out. Â Also, the heat was starting to kick in. Â These were great and our server suggested a box for them, and I'm really glad she did because I continued to eat them for a couple days after. Â <br><br>The next dish was pork. Â Yeah, I'm not even going to try and pretend I remember what else was with it or how it was cooked. Â I just remember that as someone who doesn't eat pork nearly as much as I do fish or chicken, I wanted more. Â Then came the ham frites we forgot about. Â That was laughable. Â We ate some of them, mostly to try the sauces, but by that point we were full. Â <br><br>I enjoyed everything we had and almost everything about Girl & the Goat. Â I could have done without the obnoxious people standing right over our table eating and drinking with their annoying conversation, but it could have been worse. Â If you're ordering bread and it's only 2 of you, definitely consider that as one of your plates, because as our server said, \"they're small plates, but they're not tapas....they're plated for two.\" Â Also, much more affordable than I expected.

Overall, the dishes were too heavy, and either salty or oily, lacking delicacy (which although may be somewhat a feature of the dishes and the style of food, but it is a little too much nevertheless)<br><br>I'll start with the individual rating of the dishes<br>Shishito peppers: This was literally a bowl of peppers with Parmesan on top and a pool of salty miso on the bottom. I like peppers as much as the next person, and I hate to complain about large portion size. However, it became a burden at the end to have to eat our way through innumerous peppers (without some other element to break up the monotony of the dish). The peppers at the bottom were soggy and the whole dish was relatively oversalted. I would recommend this if your party is large and you want to each eat like 4 peppers, but it would be a travesty to order this if you are say out for a date night, because get ready to eat peppers.<br><br>Goat Liver: literally the highlight of my night, I wanted to give a whole other star just for the sake of this dish. the mushroom, pickles and i believe it is kumquat went so amazingly with rich goat liver. My one caveat is that the bread which came with this was overly rich, and it is unnecessary to have so heavy and oily a bread to go with something already so rich<br><br>Short ribs: Not bad, but unremarkable. They were not quite melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the sauce was not lick my plate good. A solid dish, but not one that deserves raving.<br><br>Ham frites: This is probably my fault in part for having fries ordered, but its fries with a cloyingly salty and rich ham powder sprinkled on top. Again, the dish lacks any element of lightness, or anything to counterbalance the straight oily saltiness<br><br>Duck breast: this was so disappointing; the sauce was a two-bit teriyaki which tasted too sweet and could have come out of a costco frozen half duck packet. the shrimp could have saved the day if there was slightly more of it, but there was probably 3/4 of one shrimp cut into the dish. the meat itself was not badly cooked, but as was the theme of the night, was unremarkable<br><br>goat carpaccio: good dish, solid 4/5 I would say, but again, it was topped with some fried kale (If I remember correctly); fried things become a crunchy crutch<br><br>goat empanadas: I was really so unimpressed with this. it was a 14$ dish that had no distinctive feature. the goat? not poorly seasoned but had no \"wow\" factor. The dough part was similarly unimpressive. If I had been handed this empanada off a food cart, I would have been satisfied, but not from a restaurant of this stature. <br><br>chickpea fritters: I was very confused about how I felt about this dish. the fritters were doughy and delicious, but they came accompanied by what seemed to be an arbitrarily complement of salad<br><br>overall, come relatively hungry; four college students could not polish off 8 dishes so at least the portion are relatively good for a \"small plate\" restaurant (but this also speaks to the heaviness)", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This is one of the toughest Yelp reviews I've ever had to write.

We ordered several dishes on the menu and each can only be described as SALTY. I do not consider myself \"salt sensitive\" and I can appreciate salty foods. I expected that many of the dishes we ordered would be salty due to the ingredients but everything was so overly salty that everyone at the table felt sick by the end of the evening.<br><br>To be fair, we knew the roasted beets contained anchovies and the sauteed green beans contained fish sauce. I get that the dishes should be salty but we could not finish even one of these dishes between three people. Each dish ordered after these two should not have been salty but the roasted cauliflower, pan roasted arctic char and pork belly tasted extremely salty. At this point, my boyfriend brought up the issue with our awesome waiter, Brennan. He seemed surprised that we weren't enjoying our meal and couldn't finish any of the dishes we had up to that point and let the manager know. Aaron, the manager, immediately apologized to our entire table and said he would take care of everything. The chefs were advised to go easy on the salt for our final two dishes, the confit goat belly and the pig face. The pig face was delicious, perfectly crisp and seasoned just the right amount. I wish I could have enjoyed it more but by this point, I was already feeling sick from the previous dishes. The miso-butterscotch budino was wonderful as well.<br><br>Throughout the rest of our meal, our waiter continued to check on us and make sure we were enjoying our food.

The cider he didn't care for so I finished it. <br><br>The wood oven roasted pig face comes with a sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro sauce, red wine-maple, and fried potato stix. You swirl it all up and dig in. All the elements reminded us almost of a breakfast dish. The meat was cut into pieces and vaguely bacon-y taste. The sweet of the red wine and maple infused the potato stix. The cilantro sauce was almost more of a garnish, which is good since that taste can over balance an already intense dish. We liked the inclusion of the egg. It was rich, sweet, and salty.<br><br>The service here is very friendly and knowledgeable. I had a fun conversation with the manager (a GQ looking man). He mentioned when I asked the Pig Face and Cauliflower are standouts on the menu and we talked a bit about the Goat and Little Goat. <br><br>The atmosphere is lively. My companion felt the decor and lighting reminded him a bit of a steakhouse. I liked it is low-key and modern. The music is an interesting mix of modern alternative. I heard Phoenix and maybe MGNT. They have chefs tables at a bar facing the kitchen which would be fun to dine at. From were we sat we could see into the open kitchen which was cool seeing them gracefully make magic.<br><br>The menu has a lot of accessible ingredients presented in innovative ways.

I decided to try this luscious cheesecake. It was not to rich at all and it was the perfect portion size. The pomelo (which is kind of like a mild grapefruit) cut the little richness that it had and everything from the pretzel cream to the melt in your mouth beer meringues was... Well... definitely worth the calories!<br><br>Squash sticky cake - this was my favorite dessert!! Â I love Â sticky cakes with their sticky, semi crispy bottom.

I thought I'd add my two cents by ranking everything I had and saying what I most liked about it so here goes!<br><br>Ranked from favorite to least favorite: <br><br>1. The Green Beans. I know, it's a veggie! How could it be number one on the list? It's the most flavorful, crunchy green beans I have ever tasted! Very savory and delicious, just fullllll of flavor! My friend and I could not stop eating this dish. Absolutely get it! <br><br>2. Close second: The pig face. Wouldn't have ordered it had it not been for all of the magnificent reviews about it! Our waiter and the chef recommended that we just mix everything (open the egg and mix it all together) instead of splitting it down the middle because if we do so, we might miss some of the flavors. Great recommendation! A great mix of sweet and savory, and melt in your mouth pig face! As others have mentioned, it definitely doesn't look like pig face, so no worries there. Anyway, definitely delicious!<br><br>3. The miso butterscotch budino. Delicious!! Our waiter recommended it and we were a little skeptical because the description wasn't very compelling, but the description definitely didn't do it justice. It had a nice sponge cake and all the flavors (the candied cashews, the whipped cream, the cake, the toffee, the pineapple) all came together to give a nice flavor that wasn't too sweet. Since my sweet tooth is not as prominent as that of some others, this was the perfect dessert for me (although I didn't taste the bacon...not necessarily a bad thing, just a note, it's not a strong flavor). <br><br>4. The goat blue bread. Soooo delicious. Very savory bread with lots of flavor. I love goat cheese so this was definitely the bread for me. I wasn't crazy about the onion jam, so I preferred the fig butter with it. Very good! <br><br>5. The miso hungry bread. This was a little bit toned down compared to the miso bread. The apple sauce spread was delicious! The bread was great, but not as good as the goat blue. So you can't really go wrong, but it depends on if you want a bread that has a more subtle flavor (miso) vs. one that is packs a nice punch (goat blue).<br><br>6. The goat empanadas. I may have eaten this wrong, since there were a lot of toppings and elements to it that I didn't really get to incorporate (I took the one on top and my friend took the one on the bottom). It was good, but I felt the goat filling could have been a little more seasoned. It tasted a little plain, but I was still quite impressed by everything! Will definitely be back! <br><br>Next time I will try the cauliflower since I heard that was also an amazing dish. Also, the service was great.

I think keeping the menu small allows them to do the few dishes they serve well. I'll definitely be back to try the other menu options.

It's bit on the noisy side even for a weekday dinner. The food is on point and has unique flavors. The plates are novel ideas on crowd pleasing standards. For example we all like a cinnabon every now again when no one's looking. Here you can eat one without shame (or with it if you're into that kind of joy reducing eating) because they are quality made and hit the spot. Their take on the cinnabon is called Ooey Gooey Cinnabun<br><br>The bad(ish): Nothing bad for me so far. Only maybe that they don't give me an extra stomach when I walk in so I can enjoy more food. It is on the louder side even during the weekday. If you're on a date I recommend the smaller 2 person booths instead the 4 person table, or a seat at the bar-like seating in the dinning room. It will be more intimate. If you have a group, grab a booth but don't expect to hear the person diagonal from you without some work.<br><br>The good/great: I'll keep this short. It's quality food, done right, and offers unique flavors on foods you already like. Like kimchi (or want to try it)? Like pancakes? You're in luck: Kimchee Pancakes. Same idea goes for their cocktails.<br><br>Keep in mind/More good stuff: Mostly a 20-30's yuppie crowd as standard in the west loop. Still family friendly.

Then, we reached restaurant at 4:35pm to be told that there was no availability and we can sit in lounge to eat - while there were more than half the tables empty.

The atmosphere is not uncomfortably pretentious like in other restaurants of this popularity and price range, and my food baby is proof of just how much I enjoyed the food. They recommend ordering 4-5 dishes for 2 people, but my friend and I, wanting so badly to try everything, ordered seven things in total. <br>1. Miso Hungry: I could not tell the butter was miso butter, but whatever it was it was delicious. The kimchi also was refreshing, and made the bread+butter combination not too cloying. Now on to the bread. Oh. My. God. The bread arguably was my favorite part of the entire night. I'm not sure what type it was, but it was just slightly sweet and incredibly buttery and flavorful. A great way to start the night!<br>2. Roasted Beets: I love beets, so I never will complain about a beet salad, but this one was genuinely one of the best I've had. The greens and the avocado creme fraiche were so textured and beautiful. And the BREAD CRUMBS. (What is with place and bread-ish products? So good!)<br>3. Chickpea Fritter: The garam masala yogurt actually makes the dish. The fritters obviously were amazing, but without the creamy/cold nature the yogurt provided, the dish may have been too fried. It was also just a beautiful dish. The golden, white, green, and purple (!) colors worked so well together.<br>4. Wood Grilled Broccoli: Possibly my least favorite dish of the night. Don't get me wrong... It was still wonderful, but it was just less innovative than the other parts of the meal. The crispies were a fun surprise, but the bleu cheese was just slightly too rich for my taste. The wood grilled taste was still great, though.<br>5. Sweet Potato Bleu Pierogis: My friend's favorite dish of the night. The mushroom sauce and mushroom ragout underneath and the apple slices above the pierogis were such welcome additions. The pierogi filling was just the right amount of sweet, and the crispiness of the dough was something I will continue to crave for a long, long time.<br>6. Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face: My friend is a vegetarian, so the above dishes we ordered all excluded meat, but I had to try this dish that I had heard so much about. This was perhaps the most aesthetically pleasing dish of the night. So photogenic. The pig face was honestly a little too rich for me, and I could have done with a little less of it. But despite the fact that this is not a dish for those who don't enjoy the fat part of their meat, the first few bites were so flavorful that I could not help but eat the rest. The sunny side egg was, as sunny side eggs oft are, an awesome touch, and I ate every single one of the \"potato stix\" on my plate.<br>7. Goat Cheesecake: A little underwhelming, but still so delectable. The goat cheese taste was strong but not overpowering, and the presence of beer in the form of \"beer kisses\" (which tasted like caramel corn... and I am not complaining about that) and beer caramel added a depth to the dessert that otherwise I feel like I would have missed. Again, not my favorite part of the night, but still absolutely recommended.<br><br>A glutton/foodie's delight. Bravo Stephanie Izard.

I'm not saying it's not good, it's better than average. But for a place with over 2000 Yelp reviews and 4.5 stars, I definitely expected to be blown away, and that didn't happen. Maybe it's too popular to keep its quality? Or maybe it's the branching out into little goat that distracted chef's effort and talent? <br><br>To be clear, this is not the first time we came to g&g. We came here when it first opened in 2010, twice within a month, because back then reservation was WAY easier and we were simply amazed at how great the food was and how talented chef Izard was. Fast forward to present, it's near to impossible to score a reservation within two months, and the food we had really wasn't that great. Here's what we had: <br>- Bread with tomato oil and mushroom butter: this was the best dish we had all night. The combination of tomato oil and mushroom butter reminded me of dipping the bread in tomato soup. The bread was amazing, not too hard, not to soft, perfectly fluffy. 5 out of 5 stars. <br>- Oysters: I could be biased, but those were west coast oysters and I hate west coast oysters. We got the uncooked ones, so all I could judge was the little pickles on top of the oysters and they were OK. 3 of 5 stars. <br>- Beets salad: this was extremely average. I regret getting it. It's beets salad with dressing and breadcrumbs. There's no complexity to it, maybe it's the point of salad? But I was eating it and thinking did girl and the goat really just serve me such an average salad? I refuse to even review it. <br>- Escargot ravioli: the sauce was very tasty. However, we didn't think the concept of escargot ravioli works--it's a little too dry if you just eat the ravioli by itself. The escargot needed more butter, needed more salt, and the dish didn't give me enough sauce to compensate for the lack of butter or salt. 3 of 5 stars.<br>- Goat belly confit: I don't like goat, so I ate the lobster on the plate. But this was a really one dimension plate--gamey goat, creamy sauce, lobster meat in some other creamy sauce. There's no contrast in either texture or flavor. And quite honestly goat and lobster really just didn't agree with each other. 1 of 5 stars. <br>- Pig face: yes, this used to be my favorite and it has been on their menu since the day they opened. It's still very good, even though it was indeed on a little heavy side, I enjoyed every bite of it. 4 of 5 stars.<br>- Miso butterscotch dessert: It was actually quite yummy. But I can't candidly judge anything butterscotch because it just simply can't compare to the unbelievably amazing miso butterscotch shake that I'm in love with at Allium. 4 of 5 stars. Â <br><br>So overall, I was tempted to give a 2 stars. But one thing made it up a little--somehow, there's record in their system that we had food allergy. Even though we haven't been here in a LONG LONG time, they remembered. And our lovely waitress also made sure to confirm with us in the beginning. I'm a sucker for this type of attention to small details.

Not only that, I watch Top Chef and (very recently) The Taste and the guest mentor and judge on one of the episodes was Chef Stephanie Izard so I was ecstatic when I was able to get a reservation in for my sister's birthday this past weekend. I booked two weeks in advance and we got a table for 10:45 PM on a Saturday. Â <br><br>This place was kind of like tapas style, small dishes, so we ordered one item from each category (Bread, Oyster, Goat, Vegetable, Seafood, Meat, Dessert):<br><br>Herbs of a Feta<br>Fried Naked Cowboys<br>Chickpea Fritter<br>Pan Roasted Monkfish<br>Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face<br>Confit Goat Belly<br>Citrus Pavlova<br>Miso-Butterscotch Budino<br><br>For the bread, we ordered the Herbs of a Feta. Crispy on the outside and so soft on the inside. You can taste the herbs. I loved the hummus and dipping the bread into the feta oil. So tasty and great aroma. <br><br>After the bread, we had the Fried Naked Cowboys. I was hesitant about ordering this at first. I like my oysters raw. I usually don't appreciate it any other way but raw. My sister, however, doesn't eat raw oysters and the waiter said his favorite was the Fried Naked Cowboys. When it came out, it already looked so good. Each oyster was on a spoon already with the egg salad and capers. Mmmm it was one delicious, flavorful bite!<br><br>Next up was the DELICIOUS Chickpea Fritter. Wow. I HAVE to learn how to make this because I know I can't keep coming back every weekend just for this one dish. The outside was so crispy and when you bite into it, the chickpea filling was SO soft. The texture was perfect. Mixed with the other stuff in the bowl and it's the perfect vegetable dish. This was my sister's and my favorite of the night. We love chickpea (hence the hummus with the bread and then this dish with chickpea too).<br><br>For the fish/seafood, we tried the Monkfish. This was good but we didn't talk about it after dinner, like the way we would about the things we absolutely loved. We talked about the next time we would try the other stuff under their seafood section, like the Hamachi Crudo, Striped Bass or the Scallops so the Monkfish didn't blow us away or we would talk about that instead, but it was still good. <br><br>Majority of the reviews mentioned the Pig Face. This dish is special because you cannot find it at most \"American\" places. It's common at certain Asian places. This was wood oven roasted and you can taste it too. It smelled so good. The meat was crispy and had fatty areas so it balanced really well. It was topped off with a sunny side egg. Move the egg over a bit and cut it so the yolk falls on top of the meat and eat it altogether, with the other stuff on the plate. It's a really great bite. If you cut it with the egg sitting on top, the way it's brought out, then the yolk will just fall to the sides and onto the plate itself, not the meat. <br><br>Next up was the Confit Goat Belly. This was delicious, not because the star was the goat belly, but because they also had lobster, crab and fennel with the dish. Cut up a piece of the goat belly, add a piece of the lobster and crab, then scrape the food with the bourbon butter on the plate, and eat it all in one bite. The flavors were there. The texture worked. This was the perfect bite of surf and turf.<br><br>On a side note, the table next to us was raving about their Goat Empanadas. I heard the lady say the Goat Empanadas were the best empanadas they have ever had. I'll try that next time, but thought it was still worth mentioning on here.<br><br>After the food, it was time for dessert! At this point, we were craving for something sweet so it was perfect timing. We wanted something fruity and ordered the Citrus Pavlova. Wow. I could eat this ALL DAY. There were so many different components in this bowl. There was blood orange, yuzu curd, ice cream, kumquats, this thing that was like vanilla meringue (I have to learn how to make this!). This was PERFECT after all the other dishes. The next thing was probably an even more perfect ending to an amazing meal. Since it was my sister's birthday, they brought out a small serving of the Miso-Butterscotch Budino (bacon toffee, glazed pineapple, candied cashews) on the house. This was the most amazing dessert. I was about to lick the miso-butterscotch off the wooden board it was served to us on, but I refrained from doing so. 2-3 days later, my sister and I are STILL talking about the ice cream, the yuzu curd, the miso-butterscotch with the toffee and the pineapple chunks.<br><br>Yup, we are definitely going back.

Â <br><br>I loved it and it was well worth the wait. Â The interior of the restaurant is quite nice, the lighting is not too dark and not too bright and the music playing in the background was very fitting for the restaurant. As soon as we got there, they sat us down and had our table ready...first brownie point!!! <br><br>The menu is based around small plates, similar to tapas and the menu is divided into three sections, vegetarian, seafood and meat. Â So if you are vegetarian there are plenty of options to choose from. Â Me being a cook and a foodie at heart I wanted to try a few dishes so my friend and I ordered their fresh bread (which they bake daily and it's really good), they have three options to choose from and we decided on h'yummus, which comes with a pickled beet relish and hummus. Â The bread was very good and it came out really warm, I really liked the pickled beet relish, it was tart and a little sweet at the same time. Â Then we ordered the green beans, the kohlrabi salad, the green garlic pirogues, wild striped bass and wood oven roasted pig face. Â <br><br>Everything was great but my favorites were the green beans, pirogues and the roasted pig face. Â The green beans were cooked perfectly (al dente) and the sauce it had was a bit tangy but combined with the cashew nuts, they were perfection! (second brownie point). Â My all time favorite were the pierogies, which came with rhubarb chimichurri, oh my these were to die for!!!! I could have eaten about 10 in one sitting, if you go, you need to order these, the dough was perfect,the potatoes were tasty, I mean everything was just to the tee...they reminded me of an empanada...which I make all the time at home, so my tummy was extremely happy (third brownie point). Â Next was the roasted pig face, just the name itself is worth ordering. So this dish was quite yummy, it was I believe two pieces of pork belly with these yummy crunchy potato stix in between with a sunny side egg on top and it had a few sauces on the dish as well. Â If you get this, I recommend popping the egg yolk and mixing everything together so that you can get bites full of deliciousness (fourth brownie point!). Â <br><br>Finally we ordered dessert, why not, right? Â We ordered a chocolate malt dessert that came with hard shell, I forgot the name, but it was good and they brought me a dessert on the house for my birthday with a candle, it was the tres leche dessert--wow is all I have to say, the cake was so moist, not too sweet, it was divine (fifth brownie point!!!!)<br><br>Overall, I think this place is worth checking out, it's best to make a reservation ahead of time, you may need to do it two-three months ahead but it's well worth it.

We took about 15 minutes deciding what we would order; 5 to 6 dishes should be good, we thought, but ended up ordering the following 7 because everything sounded appealing!<br><br>ham frites - the beer sauces that come with these deliciously crisp and thin frites are the highlight of the dish. The tomato based sauce was a favorite, we asked for more!<br><br>diver scallops - not a standout dish, but well done and presented. The bok-choy complimented the well cooked scallops.<br><br>sugo - pappardelle folded over tender pulled pork with hidden gooseberries that burst in your mouth with a sweet tanginess are a fantastic surprise against the meatiness of the pork and is just absolutely delectable! It set the mood and expectation for the rest of the meal.<br><br>beef short rib - crispy fried rice neatly layer the top of three pieces of short ribs, with the heads of small mushrooms peeking through them. The beef, quite unexpectedly, melts in your mouth. Literally. I could feel the meat gently come apart, soft and perfect.<br><br>mushroom ragout - small mushrooms blended with creme fraiche and capers adorn rectangular agnolotti that confine buttery mashed sweet potatoes waiting to burst in your mouth and send your taste buds into a frenzy. This was my favorite dish - I love mushrooms and ravioli and sweet potatoes. The sauce in this dish is a sort of gently sweet tomato creme concoction. It makes you almost want to cry.<br><br>wood grilled broccoli - not my favorite, but then I've never liked broccoli, though I still managed to finish my serving of these smoked stalks over, what I'm guessing to be, whipped cream cheese with spices and garnished with little (pumpkin?) toasted seeds.<br><br>crisp braised pork shank - a highlight that everyone must try. A shank of pork served with spicy kimchi sauce (which I only just tasted because I can't stand spicy food), kimchi, flat bread and yogurt mixed with cooling spices.<br>The meat stays together as you cut and serve, but the moment your fork latches onto a piece and places it in your mouth is when the symphony begins. The meat is perfect. The skin crisp. It just soothes and hones your palette at the same time. Top it with a jot of the kimchi sauce for a glance of sweetness that gives way to a rolling wave of heat. Fantastic way to end the meal, I think.<br><br>We were happy, full and completely awed by the food. As much as I would have loved to try the date cake, I could not have managed another bite so we concluded our journey of food ecstasy for the evening.<br><br>I'd go back here just to try out the other dishes.

This was like chewing on rubber bands that sat on a grill. The taste was entirely fat and grill. There was no magic moment, of \"holy crap this is the best thing i ever had\" The sauce that came with it had zero flavor - The only thing that broke away from the taste of rubbery grill was the blood oranges. <br><br>Then came the cauliflower. After hardly eating the Pork Belly I was looking forward to a flavor other than \"seasoned heavily with grill.\" Â The cauliflower was more of the same.

I've been dying to come here as a Top Chef fan, and while I did not see Stephanie Izard in the open kitchen, that was my only disappointment of the night! We were sat promptly for our 7 p.m. reservation with a great view of the open kitchen. At one point, they may have been adding to/stoking the wood stove, and the restaurant took on a camp-firey aroma, very nice. <br>The menu is split into veggies, fish, and meat, with another menu for breads, a wine list, beer and cocktail menu, and then the specials. Don't forget the dessert menu. That's a lotta stuff to look at! The servers call them \"sharing plates\" and recommend 3 per person, but the dishes are certainly not tapas sized and you could probably get away with 2 per person, or a meat/fish each with a veggie side to share, depending on your hunger levels. Our server Monika was happy to offer suggestions of the most popular dishes, her favorites, and answer questions about the menu. For dinner we had:<br>-Honey Butter Brioche - fluffy, hint of sweetness, with creamy butter that had whole mustard grains blended into it, and some sort of corn relish.<br><br>-Ham Frites: thin, crispy, fries served with cheddar dipping sauce. Salty and maybe like a bacon crumble almost on top. Good but I wouldn't order again from a place like this, I'll save the room and $ for something I can't get at the local diner. <br><br>-Cape Cod Mussels in a garlic sauce: HUGE mussels, and I my fiance and I are originally from Boston, so we are incredibly picky about the Midwestern seafood we encounter. I could actually taste the ocean on these mussels! Great taste of home! Plus came with a grilled crostini, and I love grilled bread with dipping sauce. <br><br>-Pig Face: of course, signature dish. No head or identifiable facial features, just slices of tender, fatty meat with a yolky fried egg on top, and potato stix. Yea, the thin little crisps you used to buy in a can 4/$1. So good. <br><br>-Goat belly confit: served with lobster and crab; the buttery, springy lobster meat, the flaky crab, and the melt-in-your-mouth goat belly were a delicious bite. Surf and turf win! <br><br>Add a hard cider and a couple of beers, and the bill was just under $100, not bad for that amount of quality food and drink. I really wish we had room for dessert, because it looked amazing (butterscotch budino or a citrus pavlova would have been my choices, I'll be back) but we were too stuffed. Great food, will be back!

Calamari on clam baked baguette with goat milk ricotta and goat bacon oh yeah baby!! Goat empanadas are a virgin goat eaters paradise. Chick pea fritters amazing resting on a yogurt sauce.

Great atmosphere, great food and great people. Thank you!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Having booked reservations three months in advance, expectations were high for Top Chef Stephanie Izard's debut restaurant. Â The menu consists of an assortment of small plates broken down into primary categories of V(vegetables), F(Fish/seafood), M(Meat). Â Secondary sets include bread, cheese, oysters, and dessert. Â Finally, due to the restaurant's namesake, there is also an entire list of dishes devoted to goat (incidentally Izard is a breed of goat found in the Pyrenees). Â  Our group of 4 split a wide array of dishes to sample the gamut of the offerings which vary on any given week. Â The order of the meal was as follows: <br><br>Duck Duck Bread (duck-fat bread served with smoked duck-fat butter). Â Hard to pass up on the name and its potential for being amazing, but sadly it scored a (duck duck) goose egg for flavor. Not a good sign when a member of your group asks the server when the duck duck bread is coming out after mistakenly eating it thinking it was complimentary house bread and butter to start off our meal (cue in Debbie Downer music....wah waaaaah). Â <br><br>Grilled Baby Octopus- Â The interplay of the smokiness of the octopus and the unsmoked Italian bacon (guanciale) are nicely balanced by the hint of acid from the lemon vinaigrette and I thought it was a clever touch slicing the celery root and red bliss potato into similar size squares to create the visual illusion of two ingredients appearing as one and being pleasantly surprised by contrasting textures on the palate. Â The additional nuttiness and aromatic crunch from the braised pistachios completed the brilliant combination. Â  <br><br>Scallops- I rarely order scallops as a main entry since I liken their ceiling in quality much like Norm MacDonald describes the two categories of cliffdivers: grand champion and stuff on a rock. Â In this case the scallops were cooked to perfection although the alternative would have been gummy stuff on a plate. Â What makes this dish stand out are the accompanying players of pumpkin brandade, pecans, fried brussel sprouts, tarragon, and fresh pomegranate seeds. Â Creative chaos at its best. Â  <br><br>Sugo- Â this was one of those dishes you just knew had to be good based on its description: Â a meat sauce of goat, pork, and veal atop fresh made pappardelle with cape gooseberries and drizzle of bechamel. Â Unlike a traditional meat sauce, sugo is pretty much meat gently binded by a light amount of tomato sauce allowing Â each separate meat to stand out rather than blend together like a traditional ragu. Â  I've had several variations of pappardelle with meat sauce in my dining adventures and this one will be my new gold standard.<br><br>Cauliflower- roasted and then dressed with pickled peppers, pine nuts, and mint. A nice break from the onslaught of meat courses which elevates a relatively bland veggie to rockstar status. Â Can't wait to make this at home.<br><br>Pork Shank- crispy braised flintstone style hunk of meat accompanied by butternut squash/shitake kimchee, buttermilk dressing, and naan bread. Â I liken this to Seinfeld's black/white cookie, rather than racial harmony, the components borrowing elements from Southern, Korean, and Indian cuisine appear to be all clashing on the plate (although thankfully not in the belly). Â My least favorite dish of the evening, Â All three components were underseasoned, and combining the elements together doesn't really create the United Nations gyro that was intended.<br><br>Goat belly confit- accompanied with lobster/crab, fennel, and brown butter, the goat was unmemorable and being a relatively lean animal, not sure if this cut bears any resemblance to pork belly. Â A mediocre iron chef dish that I do not plan to revisit.<br><br>Wood-oven roasted pig face- probably unfair to evaluate this dish since it was at the conclusion of our meal where we were verging on meat sweats, this is a very rich dish with crispy meat topped with sunny side up egg, and deep fried shoestring potato sticks. Â Tasty to be sure, but not necessarily in a sophisticated way. Â More of a corned beef hash kinda tasty where you know it's a massive calorie bomb, but not quite sure if it will be worth the extra gym sessions to work it off.<br><br>Definitely a worthy dining destination whether you're a local or tourist in Chicago (the Purple Pig is like a poor man's Girl and the Goat if you can't secure reservations) and there were definitely some hits and misses to Chef Izard's whimsical menu, but I appreciate her fearlessness in taking chances since more often than not, she gets it right.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "All I can really say is \"omnomnomnomnomnomnom.\"<br>The waitress was really friendly and made some really great recommendations.

It is essentially a juicy, tender piece of pork fat with an egg over it and thin potato sticks, that are long thin french fries. I think the french fries took away from the dish- made it a little bit too salty. <br><br>(2) Grilled marinated pork belly<br>-Least impressed with this dish. The pork belly was firm and thick, not chewy like expected. The flavors in this dish was not very interesting either.<br><br>(3) crispy beef short ribs<br>-Some of the short ribs were very tender while olthers were dry and overcooked.It was not a unique dish either as it is very similar to a traditional vietnamese.<br><br>(5) confit goat belly<br>-best dish of the night.

Some standout dishes include: garlic potato wontons (with ramps, shiitake mushrooms and other vegetables), goat empanadas (goat meat was incredibly flavorful), and roasted cauliflower.

For those of you trying to get a sense of how long it will take to get a reservation, I was able to get this one ~2.5 weeks in advance. A prime time (like 6:00) is harder to come by, even on a weekday evening. My friend has also walked in and (after waiting ~two hours) was able to get a spot at the bar.

Our waitress recommended 2-3 dishes per person to share (tapas style). Unless you want lots of leftovers, I discourage you from ordering any more than two per person. We were already almost completely stuffed by the time our third course arrived. Needless to say, we got two almost untouched dishes to go. <br><br>My least favorite dish was the green beans. They didn't taste like anything special and certainly were not worth the ~$10 spent on them. They definitely weren't bad--just your typical green beans with some salty sauce and cashews. With more cashews, I might have been more impressed. The baby octopus was okay (a compliment from a seafood-hater), but the dish really should have had a higher octopus to veggies ratio. The dish was more veggie than octo and the octo was super rubbery. The stand-out dishes for me were the roasted cauliflower, the oven-roasted pig face, and the ham frites.

The space is nice, I like the layout and it is neat to be able to see the kitchen. We saw Stephanie back there working, which was cool too!<br><br>We started with the Onion Brioche and it was awesome. It tasted like an onion croissant! The tarragon butter and red pepper chutney were great compliments. Since I am a carb lover, we ate the whole thing. <br><br>So, I was a little disappointed since 43745894 people have told me I HAVE to get the Pig Face, it wasn't on the menu. Our waitress said they sold out on Tuesday, the night before. Lame. Haha, jk. Whatever. So we went with:<br><br>Beet Salad, really good! All the right components, crunch, savory, sour, sweet. Yum and super light, which is needed since the rest of the stuff we got was heavy!<br><br>Goat Emanadas, yum! Can't go wrong with anything fried, really. They tasted a lot better than the goat I tried in Mexico that was a little bit (ok a lot)chewy, haha. Super tender and I love the sauce it came with.<br><br>Tempura Lupe de Mer: A friend recommended this. They say it is like sweet and sour chicken, but with fish. It was really good and something like I have never had before. The fish was cooked perfectly and it was delicious!<br><br>Cauliflower: Okay, so everyone raves about this, but I am not sure why. It was fine. But nothing spectacular. The peppers in it were good. It was a huge amount of cauliflower. <br><br>Suge: My favorite thing! I mean, me and papardelle are hard to separate. I can't get enough, it had goat, beef, and pork, all really tender and shredded in it. Lots of homey goodness. <br><br>Miso Butterscotch something or other: Soooo good! Super light and fluffy, loved the pineapple. Great way to end a meal!<br><br>Overall, glad we finally made it. I wouldn't stand around for hours, I would rather wait 3 months and make a reservation and wait. The music is super interesting. A mix of everything, we even hear a Lion King song I think last night!

Â For a restaurant that has so much hype and yet also seems to have so much inconsistency, I felt it was only fair to base my review on multiple visits.<br><br>My first visit was last year, probably about 8 months ago. Â We made a reservation in advance, salivated over the menu, hyped up the experience, looked forward to it all week, and were completely underwhelmed. Â The chickpea fritters were meh. Â The seafood dishes were just okay but nothing spectacular. Â The bread was downright hard, dense and disappointing. Â My fiance had just been a few months prior to that trip and said our visit was nothing like his first visit (which he describes as one of the best meals of his life). Â Everything was fine. Â The food was fine. Â The service was fine. Â The overall experience was fine. Â But it was nothing special and nothing that came close to qualifying the hype that surrounds this restaurant.<br><br>This past Saturday, while on a walk around the west loop, my fiance and I hopped in right at 4:30 on a whim and managed to snag a table for an impromptu early dinner. Â It was like a completely different experience. Â G&G keeps a revolving menu of items, but they also change the way they create their permanent items. Â So the chickpea fritters that we ordered last year were nothing like the chickpea fritters they were serving this time. Â We ordered 5 items between the two of us, and could easily have stopped at 4 with very full bellies.<br><br>Course 1: Chickpea fritters - absolutely amazing. Â A great mixture of okra and tomatoes with the chickpea and heavenly crispy blocks of goat cheese were on top. Â Absolutely delicious!<br><br>Course 2: Grilled Baby Octopus - another delicious hit. Â The chefs at G&G have this amazing ability to push a taste to the limit. Â And the grilled baby octopus pushes the flavor of lemon all the way to the point of extreme, without going over the line to make it overpowering. Â The pistachios added a delicious crunch that went well with the charred flavor of the octopus. Â And the lemon tartness brought all the other flavors together and smoothed them out.<br><br>Course 3: Driver Scallops - this may have been the only mediocre dish of the night, and by mediocre, I mean it was only very good instead of amazing. Â I've had perfect scallops in a variety of places, and these scallops were perfectly cooked but there was nothing special or unique about this dish. Â The kimchee and the rapini is a tasty accompaniment, but to be honest, I was tempted to leave the rest of the dish when the sepia came out and just focus on the new and shiny dish at the table.<br><br>Course 4: Grilled Sepia - I had never had sepia prior to this visit and it has a very firm consistency similar to octopus but the taste of this dish was so different, we had no problem with ordering both. Â The tomato base of this dish was very tangy and tasty and again there was the presence of extreme lemon. Â It was tough to choose a favorite, but I think this might just be my favorite of the night.<br><br>Course 5: Charred Pork Belly - This dish was just for my fiance, but I tried a bit of the flavor and it was excellent. Â A nice robust charred flavor that was not too hearty or overwhelming. Â He loved the dish. Â Pork belly by nature is extremely fatty so he left a good deal of the fat pieces left on the plate, but he certainly licked the rest of it clean.<br><br>Service was wonderful. Â We were at a communal table 4 unrelated parties of 2 all seated together, but it still somehow felt intimate enough for just me and my fiance even though we were sitting next to each other. Â It was a friendly atmosphere and we enjoyed conversation between ourselves, as well as with the other patrons at the table. Â Our waitress was very helpful with advice and recommendations. Â The chefs sent out some complimentary fries with various dipping sauces for the table (to promote the social atmosphere) but the ladies in the corner seemed to think it was only for them and sequestered the plate between the two of them. Â Clearly, they weren't locals.<br><br>5 courses and 2 drinks came out to under $100 for the two of us and we easily could have gone with one less item. Â I was so happy to finally experience the food that lived up to the hype at Girl and the Goat, but I have heard from many that they also have had the same inconsistent experiences. Â The only reason this isn't a 5 star for me, is because with the frequency with which G&G is constantly changing their variety, they seem to lose a little bit of credibility for always being consistent in their offerings. Â I'll happily come back in another 6-8 months and look forward to whatever batch of creations Stephanie Izard has come up with at that time, but I'm not sold yet on G&G being a dependable mind-blowing experience in every visit..", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "One of my favorite dining experiences.

Â There weren't a lot of plates that wouldn't accommodate all so the shared plates concept had to be split for us in 3 groups, so 3-2-2. Â we figure we would just split the tabs that way too. <br><br>We asked if that was okay and we were discouraged from doing it. The reason we got was because of timing of the plates, but that didn't really matter to us, so we were like...okay.... Â  (personally i think i twas more the POS system, but if she had told us that rather than timing that would have been fine..)<br>We ended up doing it that way anyways with a plan that we would figure the check out ourselves, then we could tell her what was going on what card. <br><br>Ordering was an issue. Â To start, we wanted to order 3 orders of the honey brioche, and 2 of the frites bc those we could share it among everyone. <br>Our waitress discouraged us from ordering that much, so we went with 2 orders of the brioche, and then 1 of fries. <br><br>After we got the bread and frites, Â we were left with uneven numbers, so we did go ahead and order another order of bread, Â and another order of fries. So it was pointless for her to discourage it. <br><br>When we ordered our mains, we also had some issues. <br>After the group of 3 and 2 ordered, Â that left the last group of 2. Â Everything they would ask for she would discourage because someone else at the table already ordered it.<br>This left them for limited options so they had to go with something they didn't want to get enough food for the two of them. <br><br>When the plates came, they were pretty small, so not really shareable among 4 people, Â so discouraging that they order two of them was incredibly pointless. Â <br><br>Unfortunately the service really killed the night for us. <br><br>The food was actually really good. I was in the group of 3 of meat eaters , and we got the shishito peppers, beef tongue, pork belly, and pork shank.

Shame... seeing that this place has already garnered 1000+ reviews filled with lavish praises, what more can say...<br><br>Some useful tips:<br><br>1) If you want to dine at prime time, make advance reservations. And I mean like 3 months ahead. Their availabilities are shown on OpenTable 3 months out. We make our reservations 3 MONTHS in advance each time so that we can eat at a more normal time say at 7pm. If advance reservations that far out don't work for you, your options will look like either a 5:15pm or 10:15pm seating, IF you're lucky enough to even have those availabilities left to choose from.<br><br>2) If it's just two of you in your party, I highly recommend requesting for kitchen counter seats. They have two sections of kitchen counter seating; one at the entree section (right side) and another at the dessert/appetizer section (left side). Either side is great though the right side has more stuff going on (think sizzling, grilling, etc). Each time we dined at the kitchen counter, we received a couple of additional dishes with compliments of the kitchen. This is a very nice gesture of the restaurant as it creates a somewhat personal and appreciative relationship. During one of our meals at the counter on the right side, we had a great interactive dining experience with the chefs as well.<br><br>Despite G & the G being such an overly hyped restaurant in Chicago, it has a lot to live up to.

Â Once our bottle was popped it was time to get down to business. Â We ordered....Roasted Cauliflower (half order) cooked to perfection. Â Roasted Beets (half order) that were so fresh. Â Celery root & Cheddar Pierogies (half order, two), kind of a combo between pierogie and empanada, really good! Â Seared Diver Scallops, two come w the order and they are HUGE. Â Seared perfectly. Â Duck Tongues, HOLY DUCK these were delish! Â First time eating duck or tongue and I am glad I did. Â Crispy Beef Short Ribs, like perfect meat croutons. I dream about these short ribs. Â And last but not least we had the Confit Goat Belly. Â The bourbon butter made my mouth water. Â I will not wait a year again before going back! Â <br><br>They open at 4:30 and have a line by 4:45.

What do you serve under this facial sandwich? A trio of sauces (a tamarind and black garlic sauce, a cilantro oil, and a red wine-maple gastrique).

All the crunchy on top made it fun to eat.<br><br>-=-Braised Beef Tongue-=- Looks like salad with a few slices of meat on it, with the meat being a crisp beef tongue. Really I preferred the scallops more to this.<br><br>-=-Shishito Peppers-=- So much parmesan cheese on this, and it made it so good. There was so many peppers in there that maybe 4 or 5 could have enjoyed this plate together. Good filler if you just need substance.<br><br>-=-Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face-=- The most hyped dish and with an equally alluring name, but you can just consider this like cabeza.

Came here as a suggestion from multiple friends I didn't look into the place so I was at fault for assuming an early dinner would be an easy thing to accomplish. This place was packed at 6 on a Saturday with a 2hr wait so patience and perseverance plus hope led to landing bar seating.<br><br>Started with cocktails both were great had an old fashion and bolt action (memory may be wrong on the name) and bread order of miso butter and kimchi \"relish\" (quotations appropriate as this is essentially pico de gallo with a goju chang sauce drizzled over the top, not even mixed and I don't know how you get to loosely defining something as kimchi without fermentation or even a type of cabbage) miso butter was perfect and the brioche the same and amazing together and the \"relish\" had good flavor but the cucumber was a bit too pronounced (my personal opinion as I'm focused on spice with kimchi in mind).<br><br>Next was the beet salad that included frisee, green beans, bread crumbs, white anchovy, avocado creme fraiche. The flavor on this was good but the salad was over dressed and the green beans overcooked but oddly some were and some were not but I know it happens so no big deal there my main issue was the white anchovy which I was looking forward to as white anchovy are great so I was eagerly searching but nothing and so I came to the conclusion that they must be apart of the dressing but I knew better as they aren't cheap and they sure deserve more respect than being pureed into a salad dressing and then I found it one piece smaller than the 1/4 sliced beet and that was it so I was left wanting but entrees were next so hopes were high.<br><br>For entrees I ordered the scallop dish which comes with pea tendrils, fava beans, and smoked tomato rhubarb relish (should be called a compote why is relish having issues tonight), and brandade (salted cod & potatoe pureed together). The promise of this dish was so high I mean smoked tomato and rhubarb I was sold but alas the plate came and it was wilted pea tendrils covering everything without a bit of direction or reason so I moved things around and began tasting each component fava beans and pea tendrils under seasoned, brandade salty of course but I expect some control here but maybe it's being left salty was to balance with the under seasoned greens and beans (nope had a salt lick by the time I finished) smoked tomato and rhubarb absolutely amazing not too smokey not too tart it was great, and the scallops were cooked and seasoned perfectly overall I appreciate the direction of the dish but it fell short. <br><br>Second entree my girl (not very experienced in casual fine or fine dining) got the wood oven roasted pig face which comes with tamarind cilantro, red wine maple, potato sticks, and a fried egg. Very nice plating everything looked great so time to dig in and it goes down hill immediately cut into egg and yolk stays still(I chalked that up to possibly too long in the sally or too long waiting under the heat lamp) didn't think it would be that much of a factor but that was until the pig face (assuming cheek based on the size and I'm sure tongue would have been mentioned) it was jerky(even had a two top next to us get the same dish and exclaim how dry theirs was) but she was fine with it and said it tasted good still (refer to my above statement of her lack of experience plus this note of well done steaks are her preference..I still love her) so this was a severe disappointment.<br><br>Dessert save the day please..ordered the dark matter pot de creme which came with sesame spuma, ginger caramel, and sesame brittle this was perfect. Spuma was exactly what you want the flavor was sweet and the sesame was light but present and not too much when combined with the brittle and not lost when combined with the creme and the caramel had a great texture a ginger note. I'd certainly order this again.<br><br>Overall Â we were able to enjoy ourselves but it took more effort to do so than is expected due to the acclaim of this establishment but the layout, decor, and music was very comfortable which helped. The direction and composition of the menu clearly require a high level of execution and I'm sure there has been, but not tonight.

The bread had a crispy crust but extremely soft and warm interior. I bet other breads are equally great.<br><br>Veggie - roasted cauliflower. Can't say I'm a fan. Appreciated the pine nuts and the kick of pickled peppers but honestly cauliflower is still cauliflower. Still better than broccoli would have been.<br><br>Seafood - scallops. OMG OMG OMG. You have to get this. Tender, sweet, fresh and juicy, and perfectly seared scallops, partnered with the contrasting textures and flavors of pine nuts, pomegranate, and fried brussels sprouts. Everything was perfect. The reduced pumpkin sauce was the right amount of richness and fragrance. <br><br>Meat - <br>Pig face - a must-have I suppose. Meat almost melted in my mouth. Creamy sauce and potato sticks made it more interesting. Egg could have been runnier. I'm Chinese though, so I was disappointed when I did not see a whole pig face. <br><br>Duck leg - after the pig face, this dish was just like a deja vu. You can definitely tell the ingredients are fresh and top-notch, but the treatment is pretty similar - they seared the dug leg, slow cooked it perfectly so it was tender and juicy (coz the searing locked the juice in) but the sauce was strikingly similar to the pig face sauce. The bok choy was thrown in there for a reason that I cannot quite fathom... <br><br>Desserts - butter peanut custard. Guilty pleasure to the extreme. Oatmeal-peanut crumbles paired with honey yogurt custard. This is warm BTW. Add on the cold apple sorbet/Italian ice, it was just like three desserts in one bowl.<br><br>Bottom line:<br>1. Start looking for a reservation now for a dinner in about two months - unless you don't mind eating at 4:30 or 9:30 on a weekday or 9:30 on a Sunday.<br>2. Very very good ingredients.

Â We had to settle on a 9:15pm Thursday time slot because the place was so booked; obviously, one comes to expect that a place so booked must have magnificent food and maybe service to match -- sadly, that was not the case at Girl & the Goat. Â Food was mediocre at best and service held no passion. Â It was clear that the service team just wanted us in and then out; I left believing that no one in the restaurant actually cared if I enjoyed my experience.<br> Â  Â  The table settings were a sharing plate per person, a set of silverware, a glass cup, and a napkin. Â When we sat down we were told that we had to order everything at once and that our server would course our meal out for us. Â We asked if we could order things after each course, but that request was denied. Â This was the second red flag of the night; the first being a rude hostess when we showed up early. Â We then devised which courses we would order. Â We were informed that we should order two per person, so we ordered 3.33 per person (10 courses) since we were eager to try the cuisine of the highly publicly acclaimed Girl & the Goat.<br> Â  Â  Our first course was warm marinated olives; these were pretty good, but also extremely simple (which was expected and not a problem). Â Next came the hamachi crudo with crisp pork belly, chili aioli, and caperberries; this dish was okay, but nothing to write home about. Â Next, the squash blossom \"crab rangoon\" with almonds and Chive yogurt; this was another okay dish that tasted pretty much like any other crab rangoon (which is a problem because this place Â has a 4.7/5 on opentable with over 6,000 reviews, so the food should be much better than average). Â Then came the goat carpaccio with smoked trout roe and olive-maple vinaigrette; this dish was below average -- I've had far superior carpaccio in Michigan, which is, in the culinary sense, a far inferior location to Chicago. Â When I eat at a place in Chicago that has 4.7/5 on opentable and requires a three month wait to even get a reservation, I expect that the food will be far superior to Michigan food. Â The dish tasted rancid and was not aesthetically appealing. Â The onslaught of disappointment was continued by the calamari bruschetta with clam baguette, goat milk ricotta cheese, goat bacon, and green tomato; the calamari in this dish was actually pretty good (though not deserving of a 4.7/5 on opentable), it had a nice chewy texture and a pleasant taste, but the calamari did nothing to enhance the bruschetta; the two ingredients simply did not belong together. Â Now it was time for the duck tongues with tuna and black poke, crispy wontons, and piri piri; this dish was good (again, not deserving of a 4.7/5), but it felt like it was missing an essential ingredient. Â We felt that the dish would have been complete if it was spicier. Â Now, the goat empanadas with miso-blue cheese aioli and squash-apple slaw; again, this dish was good, but certainly not deserving of a 4.7/5 in Chicago, an area that has multiple Michelin star restaurants. Â Now, the best dish of the night, the bucatini; this was the only dish that I would actually order again, if for some godforsaken reason I was forced to come back. Â The best dish was followed by the worst: the octopus with guanciale, fava beans, pea tips, pistachios, and lemon vinaigrette; this dish tasted like licking an extremely sour grill. Â I'd rate this dish a 1/10 (extremely bad). Â Our final course was the crisp braised pork shank with buttermilk dressing, grilled spring onion kimchee and naan; this dish was the culmination of our meal -- cooked wrong and disappointing. Â The dish was so over cooked that the bones fell out of the meat. Â The pork was dry and lacked flavor. Â For this entire extravaganza of disappointment not once were we given new sharing plates, and when the table next to us was reset, the busser loudly slammed settings on the table in a hurried fashion, which further lead us to believe that they did not care about our experience.<br> Â  Â  I would not recommend Girl & the Goat to anyone, especially when one considers the price. Â This meal (including a few drinks that I did not mention) cost us over $300 including tip. Â In Chicago there are so many better options for a similar price -- please do not waste your time and money at Girl & the Goat.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UBkz7wEVv4TDVr3XYzOrgg/348s.jpg", "caption": "Hamachi crudo"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mHb91RUkyWMcF7oh2rV7FA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Duck tongues"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/o5iqPM_YNt7uVcn2F5jPwA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Squash blossom 'crab rangoon'"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "My dining partner and I had been looking forward to Girl & The Goat ever since we rooted for Stephanie during Top Chef Season 4, but the dishes we had were a mixed bag; while some were excellent, some were surprisingly unpleasant.<br><br>We started off with their housemade lemonade and \"Happy Juice,\" a fruity ginger ale. Â The lemonade was very good, but the Happy Juice was just okay; the server described it as a strong ginger ale, but it was on the weaker end of ginger drinks I've had.<br><br>These were the dishes we were able to try:<br><br>Escargot ravioli (with bacon, tamarin-miso sauce) - A nicely balanced dish accompanied by crispy onions, which gave the dish a good textural balance. Â The sauce was rich but delicious. Â <br><br>Braised beef tongue (with masa, beef vinaigrette, salsa verde) - The beef tongue was tender and paired with some pickled veggies which brought a bright acidity to the dish. Â The salsa verde was on the edge seasoning-wise.<br><br>Wood oven roasted pig face (with sunny-side egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine-maple, potato stix) - Our server helped us mix this dish throughly. Â The flavor combination was a delicious balance of sweet and savory. Â The pig face melted in your mouth.<br><br>Diver scallops (with brown butter kimchee, hazelnut rapini, and avocado) - The kimchee was incredibly salty, but the scallops were nicely prepared and had a good sweetness. Â <br><br>Roasted cauliflower (with pickled peppers, pine nuts, mint, and parmesan) - I thought this was a fine dish. Â The portion was very generous. Â The parmesan made the dish a bit salty.<br><br>Wood fired walter's chicken (with asparagus, rhubarb, green goddess dressing) - <br>The chicken had a bit of a generic barbecue taste but was tender. Â Some of the asparagus was deep fried; the other asparagus on the plate was quite bitter. Â The bread that accompanied the dish, which seemed like a sort of pita bread, was excellent. Â The rhubarb tasted fresh and tart.<br><br>Sugo (with pappardelle, rosemary, and gooseberries) - I wish this dish had more pappardelle, which was tender and had a nice mouthfeel. Â The gooseberries were bright and flavorful. Â I found the sugo to be too salty; our server described it as a meat sauce, but I would say it was more meat than sauce. Â <br><br>Config goat belly (with bourbon butter, lobster and crab, and fennel) - This was perhaps the most disappointing dish of the night. Â The goat belly was a bit on the dry side, and the seafood accompaniments were drenched in butter (to the point where you couldn't taste the seafood very well). Â <br><br>We were given a sampling of their bavarois, which was a combination of a berry compote, sticky cake, and goat cheese. Â I personally dislike goat cheese, so I just sampled the bottom flavors, which I found to be on the sweet side (but the goat cheese might have balanced this out). Â <br><br>If we were to come again (which is, I suppose, very unlikely since we're not local), I would have skipped the chicken, goat belly, and sugo for sure.<br><br>We were extremely lucky to be seated right at the pass, which gave us an amazing view of the kitchen.

The best reservation I could get for 2 people was for a Thursday night at 10:45pm......and that was 3 months in advance. I wasn't thrilled with the late dinner reservation, so when they asked if we wanted an earlier time slot if it opened up, I said we would take it. Apparently the restaurant took that as \"if an earlier day opened up for an earlier time, that's when the reservation would be\". and failed to communicate that with me completely. So on Tuesday, the week of the reservation, they called to confirm our reservation for Wednesday night for 9:30pm. I was so confused and said, no our reservation was for Thursday, I made this over 3 months ago and it's a big celebration dinner that is been planned far in advance. They basically said that there was nothing they could do, and it was either Wednesday night or nothing. I have been wanting to try this restaurant for YEARS so said 'Ok, we will come in Wednesday instead\". Since I was working that night I had to rush to find a sub last minute so I could make this new reservation. I had to change my work schedule and switch days to accommodate their mistake. <br><br>On Wednesday night, we arrived at 9:30pm for the reservation and the hostesses were not friendly at all. We waited 30 minutes for them to finally sit us for dinner. The hostess walked us to our table, which was basically in the hostess booth. I honestly don't know why this is even a table in the restaurant. My chair was literally touching the hostesses, wasn't even in the main dining room, and should not even be considered a table. I understand they are busy, but so are a lot of other restaurants in the city. If they already knew we had to switch days and wait even longer for the table, could we at least not be in the dining room instead of basically the bar/hostess booth for dinner?!<br><br>I normally do not get bothered by this sort of thing, but not only did they screw up the actual day of the reservation, we had to wait another 30 minutes to sit in the worst spot in the restaurant. After making this reservation 3 months in advance and saying multiple times that it was for a big celebration and special dinner, the staff did nothing. I have lived in Chicago my entire life and this was BY FAR the worst service I have ever had at any Chicago restaurant. I feel like since they are so popular and trendy that they do not care about customer service and they take advantage of that. The hostesses clearly do not communicate.

Â I know I'm in the minority, so your choice.<br>*****Skirt Steak a la Plancha - Need some tasty, well seasoned beef in all of this? Â Done!<br>**Crispy Pig Face - It wasn't the title that made me dislike it, I LOVE all things pork, but it really didn't give me a unique flavor and doesn't live up to the hype.<br>****Grilled Lamb Ribs - I wish baby sheep weren't so damn tasty!<br><br>The amount of food, however, was too much...even for six hungry guys (I would recommend a group of 8 if trying OOE again)!

Service was great, truly friendly and considerate, but let's talk food:<br><br>Portions weren't that big, but I definitely felt stuffed at the end. <br> <br>Bread appetizer: I forgot which one we got, but it one with goat cheese. I thought it was good, but nothing special, so I wouldn't recommend getting this--waste of stomach space<br><br>Beet salad: I'm usually not a fan of creamy salad dressing, but found this one to be yummy. It didn't have the rich/fatty taste, and was refreshing and flavorful. We saw the chefs make the Kohlrabi salad the most, so maybe that salad's the real deal, but the beet one was pretty good regardless.<br><br>Lamb tartare: Delicious, but portion was a bit small. I liked that they put some veggies/greens in there with the meat, it complimented it well. Definitely left me yearning for more. Recommend. <br><br>Pig face: The famous pig face! delicious, creamy, and melt-in-your-mouth. And of course, that fried egg on top just makes everything 100x better. Like a high-end spam, but with a pig tongue/cheek-y taste to it. <br><br>Sauteed green beans (on the house): Cooked with an asian twist, but I found it to be a little too salty. Wasn't anything special.<br><br>Goat loin: Oh my lord, this was seriously heaven in my mouth. Even though by the time this came out I was about to explode from all the prior delicious food, I had one bite and I was like \"Man, I need more of this!\". I would die happy if this was my last meal on earth. Cooked so well, the meat was so smooth and the sauce that came with it complimented it so nicely. Nice and tender, medium-rare-ish. Such flavor, much mouth-gasms. Portion was larger than I had expected, which was a nice surprise. Highly recommend, best thing I ate that night :) <br><br>Desserts: Got the butterscotch miso budino on the house and ordered the rhubarb shortcake. They were good, but I wasn't wow-ed by any of them. I might have put high expectations on dessert though, since the rest of our meal was soooooo good. <br><br>Price: For all of our food and a beer, it was $100 including tax/tip.

Not sure how you can go wrong with fries though so nothing special.<br><br>Italian Sausage Bread ($4): Basically a whole loaf of bread. It tasted like pizza, it was really good. Probably our favorite part. Crispy on the outside with chunks of sausage on the inside and dough. Real good. <br><br>Baby octopus: Well, everyone raved about it and waitress suggested it, and we love octopus. There may have been a total of 2 pieces of baby octopus in there all cut up with a bunch of vegetables and this heavy tangy sauce. Quite disappointed.<br><br>Escargot Ravioli: 4 pieces, weird texture, again,,,nothing special. the sauce was pretty good though we dipped our bread in this sauce. <br><br>The Roasted Cauliflower: just grilled or roasted cauliflower. We definitely needed this after all the carb and probably the only reason we finished it because we downed the bread and fries. but definitely nothing special. It will take you 5 minutes to make the same at home. <br><br>And finally the Pig Face: Fattiest, Greasiest meal of all. Not sure how anyone eats this, It was SOO FATTY! comes with an egg on top and they say mix it all together, definitely tastes like pure oil and putting a piece of lard in my mouth. <br><br>The waitress noticed our displeased faces on the pig face and was kind enough to take it off our bill. <br><br>Overall, I was incredibly disappointed by the food and would give it a 2, just because the bread was good and everything else was edible just not WOW I gotta go back.

We were complimentary given green beans which we probably should've ordered anyway. It was a plentiful serving, so we ate them throughout the meal with smiles on our faces.

I'm ashamed to confess I was barely conscious and severely hungover, and more or less merely a begrudging local companion to my visiting buddy. It didn't help that everything said friend wanted to order was of the heavy, greasy and beefy variety, which is a strict no-no for post-alcohol recovery-mode Irene. <br><br>Fast forward to last month, when Boyfriend and I flew out to Chicago so we could check out my old grad-school stomping grounds. I wasn't terribly enthusiastic about getting out to G&tG, given the notoriously long waits (we were going for Sunday dinner, too) and my general dislike for traveling to locales west of the river and not on the Red line. The night threatened to start off badly, especially after we got to the restaurant, and a real asshat at the bar was hogging two empty seats, claiming he was saving them for a friend -- two hours later, when we left, those chairs stayed empty. <br><br>But then a bright light shot through the murky night. Some couch seats opened up just then, and our waitress, a total team player, quickly ushered us into them, telling us, \"Don't mind that jerk.\" We immediately started the food coming. <br><br>Oh my god. The pairings. The textures. THE FLAVORS. SO MUCH FLAVORS. SO GOOD FLAVORS. The duck tongue: crispy, chewy and savory. The confit goat belly: falling-apart juicy with creamy balancing sauce. Our dessert: something I'd never heard of (apparently it was Izard's mother's recipe), but reallyreally tasty without going overboard on either the sweet nor the salt. <br><br>I honestly think my favorite dish of the night was the grilled baby octopus --Â and not just because the waitress brought it to us for free to \"make up\" for the douchebag from earlier. Just the way the chewy octopus paired with the soft beans paired with the crunchy pistachios paired with the smoky guanciale paired with the dash of soy or whatever it was she used to season the dish was... genius.

Note** The bar/lounge is first come first serve and serves the exact same menu as the dining room. They open at 4:30PM but we got there at 4:15PM and within 2 minutes, there were already 11 parties lining up to put their name down (or had their reservation at 4:30PM, I don't know). Anyway, this place clearly is aware of their popularity so getting seated was very easy. <br><br>FOOD (mostly ordered what everyone on Yelp recommended and more..)<br>1. Roasted Cauliflower: Good side dish, really heart. I love cauliflower so I love this dish<br>2. Fried pig face: I wasn't expecting a lot but this is pretty damn good and worth ordering<br>3. Goat Belly Confit: Can't come here without ordering goat. I think this was good but it wasn't very memorable to me<br>4. Jonny Applecheesebread: They have freshly made bread and while I'm not one to be so excited about bread, it was actually really good. <br><br>If you're visiting from out of town, make sure to make reservations well in advance if you want an ideal time (or be flexible and take their 4:30PM or 10:45PM reservation spots).", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Everything from this restaurant is unbelievably amazing.

If nothing else go to the restaurant, sit at the bar and order this one dish. There was quite a bit of meat (not really a tapas size in my opinion, more like an appetizer) but it just MELTSSSSSS in your mouth. I was embarrassing my friend because I just kept saying, \"Omg... omg!!!\" Literally the whole time. <br><br> - Goat Belly - This was also a MAJOR YES! It is another dish that you should go to the restaurant and if nothing else order this dish! I believe there was crab meat mixed in with some butter but it also just melts in your mouth. A rich complex flavor in my opinion. Delicious!!!<br><br>A-<br> - Jack'o'Lantern Bread - To be honest I didn't get the concept of ordering bread. I have never experienced that another restaurant but it was kind of fun! It's a great way to start the meal. The different toppings and butter made it fun and it's a good size for 2 - 3 people to share.<br><br>B<br> - Goat Liver - This is a HUGE portion in my opinion. You get five crumpets which are like five big biscuits and about half a cup of the goat liver puree. It was a good dish, lived the flavor of the GL but it was just too much food for us at that point in our meal. We only finished about 2.5 of the crumpets. I'd recommend this as an appetizer for a group of 5!<br><br>B-<br> - Chickpea Fritters - Did not understand the hype on this one. It was good but it was not great.

Bahhhhh with me, ok? <br><br>Not one to ever think much of making reservations, one fell from the sky for me on this particularly lovely Monday... and I took it as a sign that we should indeed make a return trip to Girl and the Goat. <br><br>This was my first experience at G&tG that was a bit more intimate. Just me and my favorite date...and it made for quite the enjoyable experience. I never had less than stellar experiences in large groups either, this was just a different spin...and I quite enjoyed. <br><br>First off, the Crispy Goat Neck (as my mobile tip implies) is...a revelation on the \"specials\" menu. Worth every penny of $32, it's quite possibly some of the best meat I've ever had the pleasure of indulging in. You'll need to get it. It's massive, it's delicious, and it's different. Try it. <br><br>As a starter we opted for the onion bread. I gained 2lbs looking at the dense creation that lie before me. It's incredibly good, the bread baked fresh and moist. Unreal. And a large portion for $4. I didn't want to fill up on bread, but if the onion bread was all I could eat forever and a day, I wouldn't complain. <br><br>Vegetables: Brocolli, Cauliflower & Peppers. Ridiculous. Vegetables are not meant to be this sexy, please stop! Everyone will be so healthy! No, they won't...cause these babies were doused in bleu cheese, swimming in crusted something-or-other awesome, and drenched in hearty flavor. These aren't how vegetables were intended to be...or were they? I think they were. <br><br>We also ordered the pork shank, but definitely didn't need to. We had way more than enough food with the onion bread, 3 veggies and the goat neck. You've been warned...all the dishes are good portions and VERY filling. Ain't no weaklings in the bunch. We did bring everything home. <br><br>The service, per usual was a dream. Everyone so on top of everything, seemingly moving in perfect sync without it appearing too forced or hurried. An art form, surely. Tony was our server and he was ever present but never hovering. Everyone that approached our table was confident, polite and A+. <br><br>With no room for dessert I settled on a fresh brewed coffee to decompress...mmmmm. I mean really, they think of everything here. A beat is not missed. A misstep there is not. I eat at a lot of restaurants, all over the place, and Girl and the Goat has got this thing down to a science....everyone there seems happy to be there, staff and guests alike. <br><br>Get the goat neck. <br><br>*Valet = $10.

Our waiter was attentive and welcoming, and helped us navigate the menu. <br><br>The drink menu has some cool cocktails and some nice local beers, so we tried a few to start and were pretty happy with our selections (try the Cross of Gold beer). The food menu is comprised of small plates divided into a few different categories (bread, meat, seafood, veg, goat, dessert). Between three of us, the waiter recommended we order six dishes, so we started off sharing the Summertom homemade bread and then each picked one dish for the table and one dish to primarily keep for ourselves, including: kohlrabi salad, spring onion potstickers, squash blossom crab rangoons, halibut, goat empanadas, pig face, and then for dessert, the Thai basil chocolate brownie dessert to split between all 3.<br><br>I doubt you can go wrong here, because I didn't eat a single bite all night that I didn't think was absolutely delicious/fairly unique/well-executed, but the standout for me was the halibut (which happen to be my 'personal' dish)... the fish was cooked to perfection, and the sauce and accompaniments were so out of this world that I physically had to stop myself from licking the dish after the food was gone (I have no idea what was in that sauce, but it was very umami and very addicting). I was so distracted by how amazing the food was that I didn't even think to take any pics or record the menu, and barely remembered to take a pic of the receipt so I could remember exactly what we ordered (and how damn cheap it was compared to some other lessor restaurants I've been to). I don't think the three of us even really spoke much, we were so focused on how good everything was and I think the extent of our conversation was like, \"OMG try this!\" and \"holy wow, that's fricken good\". <br><br>So, yeah, Stephanie Izard definitely won Top Chef for a reason.

So far going to Girl and the Goat was our dreamed place for special occasions as to reserve a table is close to magic. It was my b-day and my hubby booked a table a month in advanced. We were so excited! We got our seating at ... the kitchen counter! For the whole birthday dinner experience I haven't seen my hubby's face or enjoyed the meal but I saw everything what was going in the kitchen. And that was NOT what I came for. Do not get me wrong I enjoy cooking myself but when I am at the restaurant I want to enjoy food: its presentation and taste. Talking about food: Roasted Beets Salad was good but the beets were not roasted. They were cooked only and I do not know if they were cooked by restaurant or bought as bulk from somewhere (judging by the way how a female cook was dealing with them - they looked like purchased in bulk) I am a health coach and a cook myself and beets are part of my cooking experience since childhood so I know what I am talking about. And Kohlrabi Salad had crumbled goat cheese which was not stated on the menu and it was a deal breaker for my hubby. Pig's face was good but seeing it prepared for multiple times while we were waiting for our order, it took its magic away and it didn't taste the same. The female cooks were very skilled in preparing salads and deserts but I wondered why there was not a single female working in the meat section? Is there a reason for that? The whole placement made me think: would I truly enjoy cooking if I would repeat preparation of a single dish for 400 times a day? The only thing what I can remember from this outing is the look and business of the kitchen. Girl and The Goat - you TOTALLY KILLED THE MAGIC and PLEASURE of EATING OUT! Next time, we will consider going for special occasions to some local joints like Autre Monde or Cucina Paradisco where we can always enjoy the great food without seeing how it is being prepared for multiple times. It would be for the same price and great culinary experience.

Â Delicate yet flavorful with a punch of bacon delight. <br>Shisito peppers--roasted and done up with cheesy bits--another stellar choice. <br><br>Then came the goat leg served on a butcher block platter. Â Ours was about 3-4 lbs of goat leg which I swear our server said is brined, then cured and then roasted. Â Whatever they did to it, it was fall off the bone tender. Â It was meaty, it was delicious. Â Served with 5 different sauces (Harissa, a Cilantro/Mint sauce, Shallot garlic and two others) and grilled pita bread to make little goat meat sammies. Â And if that doesn't sound good, add some of the frizzled onions or slices of hard boiled egg to your sammie. Trust me, it's delicious. I think I sighed in contentment at least a dozen times. A couple of folks at our table were hesitant, but I think they were won over by this delicious meal. Â (If you could have seen Theresa L sigh and put her head in her hands--I think she was won over!)<br><br>We did get all four deserts to try as all--Red Tea creme brulee, a chocolate cake with raspberry gelato, a quatros leches cake with fresh blueberries , and a goat cheese cheesecake. They were all very good but my favorite was the creme brulee--I'm a sucker for a good brulee and this was so creamy with a nice hint of tea. Â The least favorite was the leches cake as it didn't have enough \"leches\" for us to think about a fabulously moist cake. <br><br>The space is gorgeous. Â Sleek, dark, loud--but in a good conversation carry kind of way. We did not see Chef Izard that night (no matter how much Joanne W wished for it), but I have already made up my mind to visit again so maybe next time we'll see the culinary wonder.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Im so glad this place lived up to the hype.

What can I say that hasn't already been said about this place?!<br><br>Girl and the Goat is one helluva place to get into... but if you are lucky enough to get reservations, you definitely wont regret this dining exprerience. <br><br>The decor of the restaurant is relatevely rustic looking and casual. I am currently living in Munich, Germany - but I am originally from Chicago. Girl and the Goat opened a little before my fiancee and I moved to Germany, and unfortunately we were not lucky enough to get reservations prior to our depature. HOWEVER! This summer we were back for a visit, so as soon as we booked our flights I went to OpenTable to see if I could get a reservation. Sure enough I was able to get (what looked like) one of the last slots for a Sunday night - at 5:30 pm. Please keep in mind that I made this reservation for 4 people, approximately 5 months before the reserevation!<br><br>Anywho, our server was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. She explained that we should get 7-8 plates to split between the four of us. After looking at the menu, we did not need any arm pulling to push us to order 7-8 plates - almost everything looked exteremly delicious. <br><br>We ordered raw oysters, green beans, goat belly, chickpea fritters, scallops, pig face, fried zucchini flowers, and lamb stuffed calamari... as well as two bottles of wine :). <br><br>The oysters were beautifully prepared and melted in your mouth. I did not get any briney taste - which is one thing that I missed a little, but the garnish of ginger and other spices made up for that. <br><br>The green beans... HOLY MOLY - so delicious. They are served in this sauce that is delicious enough to want to bathe in. We later found out (at the end of our meal) that this sauce is also sold by the bottle - naturally, we bought some to take with us ;).<br><br>Out of all the dishes we had, I would have to say that the confit goat belly was the most disappointing. On paper, it looks absolutely delicious, but when you tasted it... well, it was strangely sweet. Although it did not say on the menu, it tasted like there was vanilla added to the dish - which mixed with the bits of lobster was actually off putting. <br><br>The chickpea fritters were probably my favorite dish of the night (or at least tied with the green beans and the pig face). They were served with a variety of pickled veggies - which my friends (who had been there before) said were different from when they were there last... so I assume they change the veggies based on the season. <br><br>The wood fired scallops were cooked to perfection, and also were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. <br><br>The zucchini blossoms were relatively standard... nothing to write home about when compared to the other dishes. <br><br>The Pig Face.... mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. What an amazingly tastebud frenzy of excitement! Everyone needs to try it. I don't really want to go into too much detail about the dish, because everyone should go in not knowing what to expect. However, know this, it is NOT an actual face. <br><br>The lamb stuffed calamari were good... calamari were not over cooked, and everything was seasoned nicely. <br><br>All in all it was a GREAT culinary experience, and I would most definitely go back again... and again.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Don't come here if you're plan A was Au Cheval but they're too busy and will be a long wait.

Needless to say, I immediately went on OpenTable to see if they had any reservations open in the near future and luckily I was able to find a table for 2 on a Wednesday at 8:15. Not too bad considering I saw some reservations for 11:45 PM (who would even eat that late?!). When we got to the restaurant, we were seated immediately at a small table, which was a little too close to our neighbors for my liking but it didn't ruin the experience at all. <br><br>For drinks, my boyfriend and I decided to try some beer and wine that we've never had before, so I went with a glass of the Montepulciano/Sangiovese and being from Baltimore, he chose the Stillwater Cellar Door. They were both really great and complemented the meal well. <br><br>Since I did extensive research on Yelp, I already knew what we wanted to order coming into the night and decided on the sautÃ©ed green beans, scallops, pig face, and confit goat belly. We were also going to order some oysters, but decided to nix them because I wanted to enjoy each dish without being too overly full and make it to dessert! I'm glad we made that decision because it turned out to be the perfect amount of food. The sautÃ©ed green beans came out first and they were delicious. Being Vietnamese, I loved the fish sauce vinaigrette, which was an interesting spin because it somehow did not remind me of Asian flavors. I also loved all the shallots and cashews that were in the dish and I would definitely order it again. The scallops were a little disappointing though because the dish only came with 2 and I couldn't really taste the uni in the sauce. Next came the infamous pig face, which I thought was good, but a little too fatty for my taste. My boyfriend found the texture of the pig face to be too mushy and wanted more potato stix for the crunch and contrast. Last came the goat belly, which I was a little nervous to try to be honest. I've tried some weird things before, but I've never enjoyed them because I kept reminding myself what I was eating. However, I came in with an open mind and boy was I glad I did! The goat belly turned out to be our favorite dish because the meat was tender, but crispy on the outside and leaner than the pig face which was very welcomed. The crab and lobster that it was topped off with was also a great complement and I really enjoyed the surf and turf aspect of that dish. <br><br>For dessert, we shared the miso-butterscotch budino, which was the perfect end to the meal. The budino was nice and moist and I loved the candied cashews and butterscotch. My boyfriend laughed at me and asked if I was going to lick the bowl clean, but hey, can't a girl just want to scrape out the last of the butterscotch? <br><br>Overall, the meal was everything I'd hoped it would be with great drinks, food, and atmosphere. After coming home, I later found out that they were celebrating Girl & the Goat's 4th birthday, which made sense since I thought the Happy Birthday banner above our table must have been leftover from a party.

Well, then show up about 15 minutes BEFORE the restaurant opens, and they will seat you right away once they're actually opened. You can also grab seats in the lounge or at the bar where food is still served, but honestly, get there early, and you can still score an actual table, even on a weekend. Just make sure you are there EARLY because you will not be the only one trying to do this. Still, as long as you're there by the time they open, I think you should be good.<br><br>Secondly: The food is quite good, but portions are SMALL and pricey. They recommend 2-3 dishes per person (to be shared amongst the table), and that doesn't include bread or starters. This can really add up, but hey, it's fine dining, so what do you expect.<br><br>Third: As for specific recommendations, I'll just start from the beginning and go through everything we ate. We tried the \"ghums n' roses\" bread. Skip it. The bread was too hard and crusty, and the spreads were nothing to write home about. The table next to us ordered a different type of bread, I think maybe the onion, and it looked WAY better. I was simply suckered into the ghums n' roses bread by the enticement of rosemary honey butter, but it did not live up to expectations. The oysters, however, were good, but they were oysters. Nothing above and beyond really. Next up were the duck tongues. Decent but not my favorite thing we ate. Next was the arctic char. Now THIS, on the other hand, was my favorite thing we ate, at least outside of dessert anyway. This was cooked and seasoned and accompanied so well. I wish we had ordered two! Definite must try. The halibut, however, which came recommended by the server, was a complete letdown. Very bland and unflavorful. Go with the arctic char instead. Confit goat belly was also a bit disappointing. It was very citrusy actually, and while it was tasty, there was more lobster and crab than actual goat belly. It was good, but I just wish the proportions had been better. Goat loin was tasty too. Slightly gamey, but not too bad. Pretty tasty. And then we got to the pig face - one of the main reasons we came here. It's supposed to be eaten as a sort of hash, with the egg, pig face, and other accompaniments mixed together. The men really enjoyed this, but I'm not big on really fatty pieces of meat (I prefer leaner meats) so this was not my cup of tea. Finally, dessert. The miso-butterscotch budino is an absolute MUST. It's basically a butterscotch pudding/flan-like dessert, but it's the bacon toffee pieces that absolutely make this dish. You need to ensure that there is crunch in every bite, and you will seriously swoon. Delicious. The plantain cake was good too, but it just couldn't hold a candle to the incredible budino.<br><br>Finally: Valet is $11, which for Chicago isn't too bad. Street parking in the area was kind of confusing, so I'd just recommend going for the valet. The restaurant itself is nice but laidback. You can dress up or you can wear jeans. Unless you're in tattered rags, I can't see them turning anyone away, but perhaps at least make yourself look presentable. Oh, and the cutest part of the restaurant? The doggie bag has a picture of a goat with a doggie hat/mask on. Very clever.<br><br>Overall: I would definitely recommend trying it for an experience, but I will say that it wasn't everything and more than I expected it to be. Good food, but be careful what you pick, and expect to pay a pretty penny.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fLQ-w85hPS4pimbyj7pa9g/348s.jpg", "caption": "Pan roasted arctic char"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BpIaEDTfEoVJ5ybK-SGPow/168s.jpg", "caption": "Duck tongues"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/v2mxTyZrknHmg_6bh2-HbA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Goat loin"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "When I tell people I'm going to Chicago, everyone always says go to Girl and the Goat.

Â For the quality of food you get, the prices are reasonable, and I love being able to do family style and try various dishes. Â It's conveniently located off the Pink and Green lines. Â One thing if you haven't made a reservation (which I highly recommend) is that you can sit in the bar/lounge area pretty easily without a reservation.<br><br>There was literally not one dish I disliked. Â In fact, they were all above and beyond delicious. Â We started with cocktails which were all fabulous. Â I got one the Innovator, which tasted like Christmas and was perfect for a cooler day in Chicago. Â We started with the johnny applecheese bread which was SO good. Â We kept the cheese butter and malt oil for dipping later (a wise choice might I add). Â Our server was very friendly and helpful - she was right in recommending 1-2 dishes per person, so we ended up with 6 dishes (not including the bread, and dessert). Â We opted for the roasted cauliflower, the hamachi crudo, the grilled baby octopus, the pig face, pork shank, and goat confit. Â Our server also gave us a complimentary sauteed green beans which was incredible. Â I wish I could choose a favorite dish, but literally every one had so many layers of flavor, that I really can't choose. Â The roasted cauliflower had an Asian flare to it, even though they specifically told us they only added pine nuts, pickled peppers, and mint. Â All the vegetable dishes we got were on the larger side, and the hamachi crudo was probably the smallest dish (and the most underwhelming. Â NOT saying it's bad, but I guess that might be my least favorite of the bunch). Â The octopus was perfectly grilled (had a small amount of char, not rubbery in the slighest), and the pig face and pork shank were so tender. Â Fall apart off the bone with a crispy outside. Â Really can't go wrong. Â Just when I thought that we couldn't have any more delicious food, we finished off with teh chocolate peanut butter cake/ice cream and these FANTASTIC donut holes.

The bread is worth the $8 because the spreads make it taste so fancy and gourmet. Â I loved both the tortone and brioche. Â The kohlrabi salad was very nice, though much lighter and best as a starter.

We took the suggestion and practically licked the plate clean. Â The escargot ravioli was the only thing I probably wouldn't order again. You get 4 ravioli under a bit of sauce and veggies, and while it's a really fun concept, it actually just tastes like escargot inside some pasta. It's well done and definitely worth a try though, especially for escargot-fanatics. Next, I wanted to order the duck tongue because I wanted to have a new weird food to tell people I've tried! I was a little nervous because it does not exactly sound appetizing, but the rave reviews about it convinced me :). Â And my verdict is... it was delicious! Duck tongues indeed look like little mini tongues, but they are also fried and served with some more delicious sauce. <br> <br>The server was very knowledgeable and helpful, and they put your order in according to how they think the food will taste best.

With that said.... I really need to not get overhyped about restaurants. <br><br>BUT, the Girl and the Goat took me by surprise with each dish :]<br>1. Goat Blue Bread with fig butter and fennel onion jam ($4): You might be thinking... who pays for bread? But it was really interesting freshly made bread that was kind of similar to foccacia but was topped with cheese and onions through it. When slightly salty bread eaten with both the sweet fig butter and fennel jam, it sounds like a peculiar combination but the textures and flavors blended beautifully together. <br><br>2. Ham Frites ($7): Least favorite :/ I am a French Fry Fanatic (Triple F) I like trying fries everywhere. But the very thin fries here were completely OVERFRIED- to the point where fries become translucent because it's so drenched with oil. To top it off (literally), the fries were sprinkled with this grainy, powder-like version of ham (kind of like pulverized bacon). It was SO salty, we couldn't finish it. <br><br>3. Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face ($16): FAVORITE - there is a reason why there are so many reviews for the pig face - in the dish, there is a pig face, crispy potato stix, with tamarind and cilantro topped with the sunny side egg. Everything needs to be mixed up and eaten in one bite... and WOW Absolutely heavenly and perfection in your mouth. I could eat like 3 of these myself. forreals :}<br><br>4. Crisp Braised Pork Shank ($25): This is one of their bigger portions of the meal which was a very tender, meat-falling-off-bone shank, that came with a slight sweet/spicy butternut squash-shittake kimchee, creamy buttermilk dressing, and hot puffy naan. There was an array of flavors and textures that just played together quite well. By this point, we were tooo full but it was still nice to try. <br><br>5. Confit Goat Belly with bourbon butter, lobster/crab, and fennel ($19): Confit means that the meat is fried in its own fat. So.... Of course, that sounds appetizing! Ah, I dont even know how to start describing this one. It had the most INTERESTING combination of sweetness from the lobster/crab, with the tang from the fennel and herbs. It was the most \"fresh-tasting\" savory dessert I've ever had. Definitely a must-try! <br><br>General comments:<br>Cons: Price and Parking - Most of the dishes were quite salty... some more bearable than others. I would definitely want to try other dishes but coming here our meal for 2 came out to ~$90 with tax and tip. Price is always an issue but eating fancy only happens every once in a while! The atmosphere was very dark and loud so I could barely hear anything besides myself. <br><br>Pros: Our waitress was very attentive and stopped by often. I had a very pleasant experience with the food, service, and presentation. Apparently food is delivered in the order that is most \"suitable\" for your palate. Overall, the food was goood!

This was such an amazing experience; you could feel the heat of the wood burning grill while watching the chefs work diligently to to churn amazing dish after amazing dish and are able to interact with them (as is Chef Izard, they were such a friendly, down-to-Earth group of people).<br><br>Our entire meal was fantastic. Virtually everything on the menu seemed enticing and we wanted to try it all; as such we ended up ordering far more than our server recommended and it all was so outstanding we did not leave a morsel. The biggest highlight was the fried duck tongue (if you are squeamish about organ meats this is the perfect entry dish; if you had not read what it was on the menu you would never know you were eating tongue and would just fall in love with the flavors and textures). Other favorites on the night included the melt-in-your-mouth goat loin, the decadent chickpea fritters and the miso butterscotch dessert with the most heavenly pork toffee. <br><br>The two biggest complaints I generally hear about Girl & the Goat revolve around the food being too salty at times or the dishes being too busy. After three meals here I have experienced only a single dish to be too salty for my palate (and I normally am fairly averse to very salty foods). I also love that Chef Izard is daring with combining unlikely ingredients together and developing extra layers of flavor; sure a lot of dishes are rich but to me she melds ingredients masterfully, elevating the dishes and making them unique without taking anything away. The only slight negatives I can conjure for Girl & the Goat would be that during my meals where I was not at the chef's counter the regular tables are rather close together and the dining room on the noisy side - while the ambiance manages to be nice with an air of elegance alongside the energy, it is not quite on par with the cuisine that is undoubtedly worthy of top notch fine dining fare. Likewise the service while friendly is not quite as polished or personable as some of Chicago's other elite venues. <br><br>Girl & the Goat despite no longer being a new venue is still packed on a daily basis and deservedly so; this is a venue where the experience matches if not exceeds the hype. The more of Chef Izard's cuisine I consume the more impressed I become and she definitely has evolved into one of my favorite chefs. In 2013 Michelin made amends and starred some deserving but previously snubbed restaurants; now Girl & the Goat is Chicago's best restaurant that is not starred (and is superior to quite a few that are); let's hope that Michelin finally awards Chef Izard a well earned star this fall. <br><br>Follow me on Twitter: @Goof_2", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SjCKda7IAEOLH23RfhgdNA/168s.jpg", "caption": "View from Chef's Table"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/E1QuaudRHJz3V2X1gb7IVg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Duck Tongue"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "I don't think people still need reviews on this place anymore judging by the wait times and how far in advanced it's booked out.

Â For example: my friend had the \"Lift Ticket\", which I generously sampled, and, while it wasn't terrible, neither was it very well-balanced; it had an odd cocoanut expression that didn't really fit the apparent concept, and the rocks serving-size was shockingly scant.<br><br>But whatever: I came here for the cuisine. Â And, unfortunately, that's really where the preponderance of my criticism resides. Â Indeed, I ultimately found one of the main problems to be similar to that of Little Goat: the menu *reads* very well--if a bit too zeitgeist-inflected, or too unoriginally original, as it were--but execution doesn't meet conception, and the actual dishes don't fulfill their abstract potential.<br><br>Since I'm going somewhat against the grain here, however, I'd like to really elaborate my grievances: <br><br>-- Fried pickles: Very good, crisp cucumber chunks, as opposed to slices, which worked well for the fry--and with a side of skin retained, which was a nice touch. Â The batter & fry itself was very nicely done, as was the tasty but not-as-noteworthy-as-anticipated yuzu sauce; the harissa was nothing to text your sister about, but served its spicy purpose, I suppose.<br><br>-- Goat carpaccio: This was the real travesty. Â I was exorbitantly eager to try this: I love elegant raw-meat preparations, and goat was a bold choice even in spite of the putative goaty promise of the place. Â But this plate was overburdened, mixed-up mess: not enough goat (small, chunky slivers as opposed to thin, wide slices), not dressed right (a sherry vinaigrette whose sweetness overwhelmed the soft gaminess of the goat, the note that should have predominated), and muddled by conflicting, strident flavors (fried caper-berries; green-olive matchsticks; crispy-fried wonton strings; frisÃ©e; salmon roe). In the final tally, the goat falls pretty far from featured element: it operates almost solely at the margins, a background and not a backbone. Â It's like a raw-meat dish for people who don't like raw-meat; a carpaccio for diners who'd like to taste all the flavors but the carpaccio.<br><br>-- Octopus: Parts of this cephalopod were very well grilled, but others were too small and (thus) too burned (Coetzee would say this is where \"burned\" becomes \"burnt\"). Â The haricot vert tossed into things was too al dente for the mÃ©lange; the bitter, roasted lettuce--and I usually really enjoy grilled or roasted leafy greens--detracted rather than added, accentuating the pieces if octopus that were burnt. Â All together another dish--like the goat carpaccio--that by being too much ends up not enough.<br><br>-- Escargot ravioli: This was at least very tasty, with succulent escargot, wrapped in a well-rendered ravioli dough, served on a nice subtle-yet-hearty, rich-but-not-thick sauce. Â The onion-crunch topping was also a nice textural touch that enhanced the bite of the ravioli, and it functioned well in the flavor-matrix of the sauce, pasta, and filling. Â Yet, even this dish was marred: four snail-stuffed ravioli for fifteen dollars, when--as good as they were--I could eat a full plate of the best escargot in Chicago at Watershed for $11. Â Or, if I just happen to be on that stretch of Randolph, I could head to Maude's for likewise-excellent escargot, much better drinks, and a lyonnaise salad that blows any item I had from Girl & the Goat decidedly away.<br><br>To top it off, our server was a bit lame, and a bit more than pushy.<br><br>How sad.

The entire staff was friendly and helpful but the food of course was the true highlight of the evening.<br><br>We tried three cocktails throughout the night: Best of Three, Four in the Same, and the Winter Negroni. We joked about threesomes and foursomes all night and hoped the other parties next to us found it endearing. But we definitely thought the Four in the Same was the best cocktail, refreshing, citrusy, slightly bitter, not too sweet. A really good drink for the meal ahead.<br><br>We started off with one of the bread options that vary depending on the day called the aMAIZing and as corny as it was (giggle), it really was amazing. The bread was so fresh, so warm, and stuffed with a layer of gooey cheese and spinach. It would have been completely fine on its own but it was accompanied with two delicious sauces, a mole and an avocado creme fraiche. I could have just had this for my meal and been completely content.<br><br>We moved on to one of the specials of the evening, a shrimp ceviche with Malaysian style chips. The flavors were harmonious, not too acidic, the shrimp superbly flavorful and fresh. It worked so well with the chips which had their own unique flavor. But my friend and I discovered that the ceviche was brought to an entirely new level when paired with a bit of the mole from the bread. That was heaven.<br><br>We also got the roasted cauliflower which was simple yet good. I love the flavor cauliflower gets when roasted or fried already but this dish added a bit more complexity with its pickled peppers and cheese.<br><br>We ended our savory journey with the confit goat belly, which is a small portion but extremely rich. Paired with lobster and crab that all have been basted and/or poached in the bourbon butter, you definitely couldn't have too much. The goat, lobster, and crab were all flavorful but I felt it was a bit too rich for my tastes. The fennel and microgreen salad however was the highlight giving that much needed levity and tart flavor to cut the heaviness of the dish.<br><br>Wanting to leave off on a sweet note, we ordered the chocolate cake with thai-chili gelato. This dish had so many different textures and temperatures. The cake was rich, moist, and warm. The thai-chili gelato was chocolate based but not too spicy only leaving you with a subtle burn at the end. There were also pomegranate seeds and cocoa nibs for added crunch. There was even marshmallow fluff for sweetness and some milk stout to bring it all together. However, I felt there were way too many components in the dish and altogether, they were not necessarily harmonious. The stout was definitely lost from all the other stronger flavors and added to this odd lukewarm temperature in the dish. The flavors that stood out came from the cake, gelato, and marshmallow fluff. That said, we still finished it but I think it needed a bit more contrast or varied flavors given the amount of components.<br><br>All in all, this was an amazing meal and definitely a spot I would come again when I come back to Chicago.

However, I could've done without the bacon. It was an unwelcome texture contrast to the soft and goopy oyster. I also tend to be an oyster purist, but was curious and I love bacon, but the bacon flavor didn't add too much. Unique experience nonetheless. The oyster itself was superb.<br><br>Lamb tartare: Melt in your mouth. Delicious. I like the thin crackers they give you so you can really taste the lamb. The dill stuck out, and it was a welcome flavor. <br><br>Goat empanada: You can tell it's goat, and it was fabulous! The flavor marrying with other ingredients, like the hummus, made it a successful dish. Goat was tender, not gamey, but there is a slight whiff of it. It's not goat unless there's a whiff of game. <br><br>Chickpea fritters: heaven on the palate, like a Belgium truffle chocolate or a genache melting in your mouth. Crispy outside and smooth creaminess on the inside. The mix with other ingredients also added to its deliciousness.<br><br>Breads: We ordered the pretzel and sour dough. Both excellent, warm, soft. Great spreads! The tomato spread had a great tang. Mushroom spread, flavorful. <br><br>Ham Frites with beer cheddar sauce: solid! it was like bacon flavored french fries...dipped in beer cheddar? Yes please!<br><br>Diver scallops: best scallops i've ever had. Perfect sear, perfectly cooked, with the inside moist. The scallop melds in your mouth. The duck was also a perfect complement to the dish. This was one of my favorites.<br><br>Goat cheese tortellini: Another solid dish. The stuffing was rich and decadent. The pasta was made and cooked perfectly.<br><br>Woodoven roasted Pig face: Another favorite. Crisp pork and the egg was perfectly over easy and it does make a difference. Don't underestimate the egg. The pork itself is a bit salty, but that's what the egg and maple sauce are there for. It wasn't meant to eat deconstructed, but I tried it anyway.<br><br>Goat cheese cheesecake: Oh...my...GOODNESS!

Kohlrabi salad with fennel, evalon, toasted almonds, blueberry, and ginger dressing? Made my guitar (and, by my 'guitar', I mean 'mouth') gently weep tears of joy. Chick.pea.fritters. Don't ask. Just act. Do. I had them with romesco, hazelnut hummus, sesame and goat feta. Breads. They sound basic. They taste fantastic. Don't count them as one of your dishes. Just order one or two for taste.<br><br>Fish: Grilled baby octopus with guanciale, Â wax beans, radish, favas. pistachio-lemon vinaigrette. As guilty as I felt eating a baby anything (especially a baby sea monster), I can't deny that it was perfectly prepared and entirely addicting. Escargot ravioli. So much better than any escargot dish I've had in Chicago (and consumed before I would forever swear off escargot thanks to a traumatic experience in Uptown; more later).<br><br>Meat: goat. Duh. Terrine, empanada, straight up, etc. You're here to eat. Do so with abandon. You may think you know the animal, but Chef Izard knows how to change things up with each preparation to make you have entirely different experiences with the same protein... in the same setting. There's a reason (well, many) that she won the show, folks.<br><br>Desserts: they change. Get all four. No matter what they are, get.all.four. This is not up for discussion.<br><br>Cocktails: not a bad one to be had. The beer/wine list is impressive as well.

My friend and I came here during our trip to Chicago. We didn't make a reservation (as it was nearly impossible to make a reservation unless it was made months in advance). Instead, we waited for seats at the bar (which is first-come, first served), and we were waiting like hawks. About 20 min. later, we got seats. Overall, the food and ambiance is amazing. I would definitely want to come back for the other dishes that I didn't get to try.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I hesitated to write a review for Girl & the Goat, I mean this restaurant has over 3000 reviews and 4.5 stars, can't get better than that and what can my review possibly add? <br>But I decided to write this review anyway, is it more for myself? Is it for you all? I think the real reason is that I really liked the place a lot and this is my way of paying tribute to a great dining experience.<br><br>First let me get the \"bad\" out of the way. This \"bad\" was minimal but I still remember it, and I shouldn't. I should only be remembering the amazing broccoli or the baby octopus. So, here goes. You guys refill customers' water glasses every 5 minutes, which is great, but when I went to the rest room the toilet was soiled. I recommend you clean the restrooms at least half as often as you refill the water glasses. <br><br>Also, we arrived 20 minutes before our 7:30 reservation and were asked to wait, totally understandable. But why then did you seat us at 7:44? Not acceptable, sorry. And the music was way too loud. I could still converse with the 3 people in my party, but it was not effortless. I know some restaurants keep the noise level up to keep the customers pumped and ordering more drinks etc (it's true, look it up), but this is such a late 90s gimmick, come on. Finally, we once asked one of the bus boys if we could have another order of the bread and we were told \"you must ask your server\", verily?<br><br>Anyway, everything else was amazing, starting with Taylor, our server. She was perfect. Polite and knowledgeable, fashionable and pleasant, nonintrusive and helpful, cheerful and genuine. Wow, thank you Taylor, and thanks for the great explanation of the meaning behind the big painting of the girl, goat, baby octopus and walking beer bottles (see? Now you have to come eat here to see what I mean!). Taylor is a huge asset to this place.<br><br>The food was amazing. My comment is \"what they said\" (all the other great reviewers on here). I left thoroughly satisfied and happy, and I'll be back, hoping that the music will be a tad lower and the restrooms clean.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Made reservations months in advance for my wife and I. Great ambience and great scene of what one would expect from a top Chicago restaurant. The experience left a little to be desired. Our waitress, Allison G., paid more attention to the patrons seated to the left and right of us. She took the time to thoroughly explain the dishes in great detail. With us, however, she seemed a little rushed and curt. She also failed to explain how our orders would be brought out - not simultaneously for each of us to enjoy our meals together as a couple, but one after the other, with the intent for us to share each dish. However, what I ordered isn't necessarily what my wife would be interested in, and vice versa. This created awkward moments where I would eat my meal while my wife watched, and vice versa. I would try this place again, but not in any rush to return. The drinks were great, though.<br><br>Another complaint is that I made these reservations through OpenTable, and did not earn any points!

Sadly, no room for dessert! I'm giving 4 stars because the service was so great! We sat bar-style in front of the kitchen, so we had a chance to see all the delicious looking food go by, which is pure torture when you're hungry! But we couldn't decide between the green beans and cauliflower, but we picked green beans, and later, our waitress brought us a small helping of the cauliflower, which I thought was really sweet of her!<br><br>So 4 because of service, 3 for the food.

The place is a cool hipster, divey type place with lots of wood as their interior. It is a loud place, so don't expect to hear people using indoor voices. My server was young, energetic and always pleasant. He and the rest of the staff were quick to refill my water and to check in to see how I was doing throughout my meal.<br><br>I ordered 2 tapas dishes: the goat empanadas (uh-mazingly done, especially given that I don't really like feta cheese or Tzatzki sauce); and the roasted pig face (loved the sunny side egg up, tamarind, cilantro, red wine-maple and potato stix accompaniment- all the flavors worked perfectly and provided a blend of sheer deliciousness). For dessert, I ordered the miso-butterscotch budino, which is a mix of bacon toffee, glazed pineapple and candied cashews. It was so worth all the calories; I wanted to lick every last bit. <br><br>My meal costed $44.20 including tax ($16 for each entree + $8 for dessert). Sure, the portions are tapas portions, but my meal was worth every penny. I started developing withdrawal immediately after I left the restaurant. I can't wait to come here again and/or to try their sister restaurant Little Goat. Stephanie Izard, the executive chef, won Top Chef for a reason.

From the expert way in which, the dishes are prepared to the sexy and swanky atmosphere down to the service, there's no mistaking that this place put a tremendous amount of thought into every aspect of the restaurant . <br><br>Each plate was meant to be served alone without any other other competing dishes on the table so, that you can enjoy each creation in its' own fantastic and well executed way. The plates your dining on are changed after every new dish so, the complex flavors are never mixed. Girl and the Goat is truly edible art and we were certainly impressed.<br><br>We ordered:<br><br>Grilled Baby Octopus with guanciale, wax beans, romano beans, radish, and pistachio-lemon vinaigrette - I really enjoyed the ingredients used in this dish. Because the octopus and beans are generally more mellow in taste, they really can take on whatever flavor profile you want to add to it. However, the pistachio-lemon vinaigrette was just too overpowering making the entire dish too tart and salty.<br><br>Braised Beef Tongue with masa, beef vinaigrette and salsa verde - I thought the chef had such a creative play on the traditional way beef tongue is prepared. Thin slices of the tongue with fried masa, this was like a deconstructed (and fancy) taco. The masa was a wonderful contrast to the strong flavors of the vinaigrette and really balanced out the whole dish. <br><br>Diver scallops with bok choy and shitake mushrooms - My favorite plate and more mellow dish at Girl and the Goat. Don't underestimate it's subtle flavor though because these meaty and perfectly cooked scallops spoke for themselves. The delicious scallops were served on a bed of shitake mushrooms that were absolutely divine and a perfect complement. <br><br>Grilled Pork Ribs Â with a tomatillo-mushroom slaw and grilled scallion vinaigrette - Â These pork ribs were fantastic. They were fall of the bone tender and had a sweet glaze that won us over. <br><br>Confit Goat Belly with bourbon butter, lobster and fennel - The goat belly was so smooth and velvety it practically melted in your mouth. The only downside of this dish is that we felt it was a bit unreasonably priced for what you were getting. If it's your first dining experience though, it's worth a try. The goat belly was excellently prepared.<br><br>Hen of the Woods Mushroom Ragout with Sweet Potato Agnolotti, Shroom Creme Fraiche and Capers - Very similar flavor to the Grilled Baby Octopus..I really liked the Sweet Potato Agnolotti, it was so delicate and smooth, my goodness it was amazing. I would have enjoyed it alone without the tart and salty flavors of the ragout and capers. <br><br>I thought the flavors of the dishes were incredibly complex and though some of the plates were a bit too overwhelming, I still have to give credit to how much work the chef put into creating such a multidimensional menu. <br><br>Well done, Girl and the Goat.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ek6JgiveH6NnZu9fEGSqJw/348s.jpg", "caption": "Hen of the Woods Foraged Mushrooms"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/j2ZLDXtBriHavAI2QDq4pw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Goat Belly"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Q8DWsHCXzzzv8eUO8t5xTA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Pork Ribs"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "1150 reviews of G and G and counting? Â Chicago is gaga over the girl, but can you blame us? Â Chef Izard more than lives up to the hype of her Top Chef honors.<br><br>Unwilling to wait 475 months for a proper reservation, we arrived promptly at 4:30 on an early Friday afternoon, doing our best impersonation of Florida retirees, and demanded a table. Â And by demanded, of course, I mean inquired politely with an expectation of acquiescence. Â Acquiesced we were. Â Seated on the raised area adjacent to the front windows, we had excellent views of the dining room, and our adventure began.<br><br>The food, without expectation, was stupendous. Â We began with two breads, the bretzel and the mushroom, and both were light, warm, and refreshing. Â What really made them worth the money was the spreads, which included an aioli, a mustard spread, and a heavenly thousand island spread wholly unlike the bottled junk you'll find at Jewels.<br><br>On to the meat. Â The grilled baby octopus was tender and juicy and overflowing in the bowl, perfectly accompanied by rich and complex flavors of guanciale and pistachio. Â The goat carpacchio was melt in your mouth delicious, and if it wasn't for some unbelievable beef carpacchio I'd had in St Martin the week before it would have been the best I've ever had. Â We continued on to the escargot ravioli, which is almost overwhelmingly earthy but nonetheless delicious because of that, and the mushroom ragout, which was similarly earthy and delicious. Â We finished with the goat pork belly, which was also good, but, like almost all pork belly dishes, too heavy on fat and gelatin. Â Yet, I keep ordering it. Â One day I'll learn. Â All in all, a delicious, complex dinner that satisfied completely.<br><br>The wine list at GG's is full of intrigue, if a little light on Rhones. Â They do, however, stock a lovely Cabernet Franc from the Loire. Â  Chef Izard's menu practically demands a wine such as this, and I cannot recommend too highly. Â As you may know, Cab Franc is having a moment, stepping out from behind the shadows of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in Bordeaux wines and generating rave reviews in the Loire Valley, the Off Broadway storefront of France, and I for one could not be happier. On its own, Cab Franc is everything an Old World wine should be - chewy, earthy, unrefined, and demanding food, like a foul mouthed French hobo. Â <br><br>What really makes me swear in delight, however, is Chef Izard's personal bourbon selection. Â Like so many Chicago restaurants, she has a hotline straight into bluegrass country and several special bourbon selections from the finest Kentucky distillers. Â It is with bittersweet elation, my noble bourbon boozers, that you'll peruse her bourbon list, savoring the vast quality while saddened that you can only opt for a taste of one, perhaps two, barrels, before and after your meal, lest your dinner become a cloud of fog off the Appalachians.<br><br>Our server was well versed in the menu and very friendly. Â An insider's tip - if you want to eat there, don't take no for an answer, just show up - apparently, tables routinely pop up and there is a communal seating that can usually accommodate surprise guests throughout the night. Â And if you need to wait a spell for a table, you'll just have to hang out in the bar and sample a glass or three of Chef Izard's personal bourbon selection.<br><br>So you don't have to be choosy, after all.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The portions, the taste, service, atmosphere are fantastic.

But our waitress was warm and friendly, my water glass was never empty, and nobody gave me grief when I only had one glass of wine.<br><br>The plates are offered in categories, so we just decided to pick one from each. We started off with the pretzel bread and smoked salmon cream, which was OMG good. There's nothing like fresh-baked bread, is there? And there was nothing fishy about the salmon cream - it was just rich and lovely.<br><br>Next up were the wood-grilled oysters, which were cooked perfectly. I've only just discovered that I loved oysters (after a trip to NOLA) - they were buttery soft and just super tasty. The chickpea fritters were different from expected, but not in a bad way - they just melted in your mouth. Our goat empanadas had a light, crisp exterior and were everything good in the world. <br><br>We got adventurous with our proteins, opting for the braised beef tongue (my husband's a fan of tongue; I'd never tried it before but am SO GLAD I did) and the fried frog's legs (he was terrified, but we're both converts). It was all so so so tasty.<br><br>Of course, we couldn't leave without dessert. We went with the rhubarb shortcake and plantain cake. There was something a little disconcerting about the latter, but again - not in a bad way. There was just a bit of bitterness to offset the sweet, and I decided after eating most of it that I liked it (took me a while - it was just a really complex dessert!). The rhubarb was awesome, too, all kinds of sweet and tart and crisp.<br><br>As a little bonus: right before dessert, I watched Rob Reiner walk into the restaurant. Totally thought I was hallucinating or making things up, but no, the waitress came by after seeing my shocked face and said, \"You saw him, right?\" Apparently he comes there regularly. No one sitting near us seemed to recognize him by face, but hello, this is Mr. \"When Harry Met Sally\" and \"Princess Bride.\" (I died a little. Seriously.)<br><br>The check was way less than I had anticipated, which was another nice bonus. My husband joked that G&tG did restaurant-ing the way Tyra Banks does modeling: H-to-T. Everything about the place was wonderful - the decor, the staff, the food. Even the bathrooms were perfect. Oh, and did I mention the music? When the Eels \"Fresh Feeling\" came on, I knew I was home (it was the song I walked down the aisle to at our wedding).<br><br>I vow to return to this restaurant every single time I'm in Chicago.
