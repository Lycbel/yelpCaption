We had the waitress tell us about her suggestions and the most popular items, but that just made it even harder to decide!! I ordered the scallops and my friends got the squid ink linguine, spaghetti, and brick chicken diavolo. We also got the cocoli as an appetizer. <br><br>I got a taste of all three my friends got. I'd say my favorite out the three was the chicken. It seems basic, but the chicken was just perfect - so juicy, moist, tender, and flavorful. The linguine came with lobster and the spaghetti with crab - both absolutely delicious. With all that being said, the scallops were perfection. The bottom of the plate was smothered in what I believe to be squash puree, topped with the scallops and cauliflower. The scallops were large and seared just right. To be the cauliflower were a tad bland and could have used a touch more of flavor. <br><br>Service 5/5<br>Our waitress was beyond patient - she checked in on us three times before we were ready to order, she went through the entire menu giving us one or two favorites from each section, and answered our many questions.

Plus the wine list is not your average - they seem to carefully select reasonably priced Italian Coastal wines that pair well with their main meals. <br><br>I will say when it comes to Italian food, I am extra fussy because I grew up on the real deal homemade from scratch Italian but Sienna Tavern has this Savory Holy Heaven 12oz (no, that's not a typo) Wagu Meatball ($19) that's worth all the indulgence! It's considered an appetizer but if not shared, it can easily become your only dish! Go ahead, you deserve it!! <br><br>Also while it's not a \"Chicago style pizza\" contender, it's a lovely light doughy crust with pretty much any topping you could desire and not too cheesy. Pretty much can't go wrong and the kitchen serves pizza til midnight y'all! <br><br>The bartenders and waitstaff are the epitome of Midwestern Hospitality and have clearly consumed if not all, definitely most of the menu so you can count on their recommendations if you are unsure.<br><br>Know that no matter when you go, it's likely to be buzzing with River North's young professionals and a smattering of tourists sent over by wise hotel concierges. Good chance you will have to wait a bit to be seated. Having said that, on a nice sunny day, brunch on the patio is super chill vibe but feels disconnected from the energy inside... however a seat at the bar near the pizza oven is actually my preference because it puts you in a great spot for watching all the scrumptious dishes being prepped to tease your tastebuds! <br><br>My reviews are all about the ENTIRE experience. Only downside is sitting at either bar (they have two) equates to thirsty patrons hovering over your food like vultures (I like my personal space bubble when I'm eating lol) and possibly stealing your bread baskets or taking an elbow as they attempt to hail down bar service! No joke! Scram kids. This is the 3rd time this has happened to me here.

I don't often travel with my dog but when I do I like to take him out and about with me. I called a head to make sure that their patio was open and informed them that I had my pooch with me. When I arrived there was some miscommunication between the hostess and the person who spoke on the phone with me but after waiting a few minutes they were able to set a table for me and asked if I was interested in their doggie menu for my pooch. We opted for the skirt steak for the little one. It was simply grilled with olive oil.<br><br>I opted for their Margherita Pizza which had a great sauce, which had the right balance of sweetness. The crust was flavourful, chewy but crispy on the outside just the way I like it. The cheese wasn't too over powering. It was a great pizza but nothing mind blowing. <br>My husband opted for their lobster roll. This was the cold roll variation with citrus poached lobster lightly tossed with an herb mayo. This was a light dish perfect for a light lunch. The citrus poached lobster gives it a light vibrant feel to its traditional heavily drenched mayo cold lobster roll. The plus was the accompaniment of Parmesan fries, they were delicious. I also had their beet juice to quench my thirst, nothing really special to this just a simple ordinary glass of beer juice. <br><br>I will definitely have to give this restaurant another visit without the pooch and try out everything else on their lunch, dinner and BRUNCH menu! I would love to enjoy the dining experience in their dining room as it had an amazing decor especially when lit up in the evening. <br><br>I would like to thank the servers and staff who made my trip with my pooch so memorable.

The Coccoli was way better than we were expecting and the brussel sprout salad was delightful. Now for the gnocchi; all the pastas here are handmade at 5 in the morning! How crazy is that? The gnocchi had a bit of bacon in it which gave it a smoky kick that will make your taste buds craving this combination when all your food is gone.

This place was great all-around! <br><br>Made a reservation for a busy Friday night, and got seated right away. It's a very lively environment when it's hopping; the dining area is not a bad size, but the bar occupies about half the space...not a bad thing! It's a nice bar. :) <br><br>Service was fantastic. This was my first time, so the our waitress gave me a tour of the menu, and she made some great recommendations on drinks. She was clearly very knowledgeable of the menu. She was also very attentive throughout the meal without bothering us in any way. The courses were well-timed, and everything came out quickly. <br><br>Ordered the #33 on the cocktail menu; it's their take an old fashioned. It was good! It boasts a gingerbread simple syrup and apple cider in addition to the bitters. It was a bit sweet for my liking, but all around a very smooth and balanced drink. (I had two of them, so I can't complain. )<br><br>Food was great! Better than I expected. Their claim to fame is that everything is made from scratch; it tastes homemade, but they're beautifully refined dishes! We started with the grilled octopus, which was nicely cooked for the most part. Some of the pieces were a little over-cooked, but they had a nice char. The sauce it came in was very light and tart...good contrast to the octopus.<br><br>For my main course, I had the short rib ravioli. Wow, really really good! Pasta was beautifully-cooked, and wasn't overdone. The short rib filling was a decent portion, and had a very nice flavor. The mushroom sauce was very rich, and it also had a hearty taste, and a little sweetness to it. All in all, I really enjoyed it; my only issue was that there was a bit too much of the sauce. It drowned the flavor of the ravioli a bit. Otherwise, really great dish! My dinner companion has the gnocchi, which she really enjoyed. <br><br>For dessert, we had a bit of an eyes bigger than our stomachs complex, that being said, I regret nothing! We ordered the bomboloni, which were delicious, and a pretty sizable order (4)! Comparable to a State fair donut--but better. They came with three really good sauces (raspberry, hazelnut and caramel for dipping). We also split a gelato flight (donuts and ice cream for dessert! Weeee!) the gelato was excellent!! My favorite by far was the brown butter peanut. Really rich, and it had chopped peanuts in it. Ordered cookies and cream, salted caramel and creme brûlée. All very good, but the peanut is a must! <br><br>All in all, great experience! Would have been 5 stars if not for the wee missteps with the ravioli being over-sauced. They're quite pricey, too! Pasta starts around $19 a dish, and meat entrees started at $30, but averaged about $45.<br><br>I would definitely come back, but this is more of a special occasion place.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Liked this place...if it weren't so expensive for what you get I'd visit much more often.

The bar is a beautiful large oval with seats all around...many face outward looking through large plate-glass windows giving a gorgeous view. The room also has high tables around the edges so the bar area holds a lot of people. Nice venue to meet and greet. The liquor was the usual...the mixed drinks sounded pretty creative. My $$$ comment earlier referred to a $15 Johnnie Walker Black on the rocks...two drinks and you bought the bottle at home. The Margarita was too tart, the Bloody Mary was very nice, and the Disaronno Sour was perfect. Three drinks (we returned the Margarita) and a glass of wine for dinner with bar tip brought us to $75...so this is where they make their money.<br><br>In the dining room we had: the Gnocchi (5 stars for the pasta as it was creamy and puffy, but the rating gets knocked down to 4 because the included fried sage was not a good addition and there just wasn't enough of the wonderful pancetta), the Carne Pizza (5 stars and really the best of show...with all the meat on top the crust sagged a bit but that was  expected), the Tagliatelle (3-4 stars and very nice but some of the mushrooms were too crunchy). For dessert: the Chocolate Cake (4 star good but a small serving if you are sharing) and the Gelato (3 star good but unremarkable). <br><br>Service was on and off...in the bar it was on...attentive and ready to please; in the dining room it was off...more lackadaisical and inattentive.

The ricotta cheese was smooth, the noodles were firm, and the fresh Parmesan on top was a delicate touch of savory saltiness.

On this trip, a colleague suggested we check out Siena for some epic Italian, so we made a reservation and then made our way to this highly sought after foodie paradise. <br><br>The menu is interesting. There's a good variety, but don't think you're going to come here to have a steak and potato. Unless you're willing to shell out $90 for a porterhouse steak, you're out of luck. <br><br>But there are plenty of other options. <br><br>For appetizers we choose the meatball, which is aptly named--it literally is a giant meatball. We also ordered the grilled octopus in lemon and these puffs made with Choux pastry (think savory cream puff) served with burrata, prosciutto and a green chutney-style sauce. The meatball was super tender and tasty. The octopus was off the charts! If I could have eaten the whole app by myself, I would have...it was that good. The puffs were good, but nothing special. <br><br>I was traveling with a colleague who had allergies. They accommodated his diet, allowing him to create a custom pizza, which he seemed to enjoy. My other colleague ordered a lobster spaghetti. She liked it, but it must have been rich because she barely ate it. <br><br>I ordered the short rib ravioli. The meat filling was tasty, but the pasta could have used a little more time in the pan. The pasta had a doughy, chewy taste, so I ended up eating the stuffing.  I know, I know...you're thinking al dente, but this wasn't al dente; they just weren't cooked long enough. <br><br>I really didn't have room for dessert, but okay, let's try the tiramisu. It was huge!  It was also really, really good. It came with these awesome coffee meringues. I could have just eaten a pile of them for dessert. <br><br>For drinks we ordered a red wine from Sardinia. What a great wine list. The wine was super and not horribly priced. While I didn't have a cocktail, they had some really interesting selections. <br><br>I'm really happy we tried Siena.

You cannot dine hear without eating the meatball. DO IT.  All the pastas are homemade. We shared the gnocchi with pancetta and the squid ink pasta with lobster.  The gnocchi was nice and fluffy.  The squid ink pasta itself was nice and light but in a cream sauce full of lobster.

The music was super loud and you could barley hear what the person next to you was saying. This was already throwing off the mood considering I wanted this to be a nice and quaint birthday celebration dinner. We started off with 2 glasses of wine, which were crazy overpriced. For $14 a glass, I was expecting much better wine. Honestly, that is how I felt most of the night, ripped off. Some of the food was really good including the fried dough appetizer with the prosciutto and cheese and the gnocchi pasta entree. These were absolutely delicious and they were the only things that were worth their price point. We also ordered their short rib ravioli which I was very disappointed with. It seriously tasted like the chef dropped balsamic oil all over the raviolis. Balsamic was way too overpowering.

This too was excellent. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce wasn't too heavy. Also, the amount of crab in it was super generous. Overall, I can't wait to go back here.

There weren't any other cases, so I think we likely had the stomach flu, which makes me feel much better about Siena Tavern. However, I feel badly that I was wrong about food poisoning--I made the judgement based on the best info I had at the time, but still, I hate giving a negative review for something that wasn't correct.<br><br>The manager I spoke with was very generous, offering to make things right for us with another visit to Siena and a refund for our meal. He explained that any time a customer reports an issue, he is made aware, and that there are procedures that are followed. I appreciated his transparency. He also acknowledged that there were many factors involved in my frustration with the restaurant, and assured me that they have very high standards in their hospitality that should be evident the next time we're there.<br><br>I'm looking forward to visiting Siena again to get the experience that almost everyone else who reviews it has had. That, and, the food really was very, very good.<br><br>Thank you, Kamil and Siena Tavern for your attention to my concerns. It makes all the difference.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Original review:<br><br>I gave Siena Tavern 2 stars only based on the food, otherwise it would have been 1 star. <br><br>My husband and I had a late lunch at Siena Tavern on January 4. After reading the stellar reviews, I was really excited to dine there. The food was amazing. The coccoli, gnocchi, and brick chicken were all delicious. However, this 2-star review is based on the service and highly suspected food poisoning.<br><br>From the beginning... At 3:00PM on a Thursday afternoon, Siena was not busy. However, it took a while for the hosts to get us seated. Then, our server (who was inattentive to the point that I wonder if she would rather work somewhere else) couldn't answer simple questions about drinks that were on their menu, and had our drinks out after our appetizer and pasta course were served. We specifically asked that the pasta come out with our entree, and she did not apologize when she saw that it had come out before. She always seemed to be in a hurry, even though the restaurant was less than 25% full.<br><br>Now, the food poisoning. I thought at first my husband had come down with the stomach bug that's been going around. However, when I suddenly became ill as well, it made me suspect food poisoning. We never get sick at the same time, and since we ate the exact same things at Siena (one of which was pork and another salad), we are 99% sure it was food poisoning.<br><br>This would all be slightly OK (things happen), if the service before and after our horrible sick day had been at least adequate. We have a 9-month-old at home, and wanted to know if we had food poisoning or a virus he might get so we could be extra vigilant with the Clorox wipes. I called Siena when we both became ill to find out if anyone else had reported food poisoning. It was apparently very loud in the restaurant, and the hosts hung up on me 3 times because they couldn't understand what I was asking. I had full service on my phone and was calling from a quiet room. Finally, I got someone who took the time to listen carefully, and she assured me that a manager would call me after the dinner rush. I'm still waiting for a call.<br><br>I've wanted to go to Siena Tavern for a while, but they turned what was a great date into a very bad memory.

The Burrata was excellent and arguably the tomato jam that came with it elevated the dish. It was a nice complement and twist on classic tomatoes and greens you typically get with Burrata. I opted for the carrot tortalocci homemade pasta, essentially a riff on butternut squash tortellini. It was fantastic. One of the best homemade pasta dishes I've had. They were like these delicately filled purses in a wipe the bowl clean butter sage sauce, almost more of a thinner gravy consistency. It was so good.

Overall everyone was happy with the items. The only low point was the truffle eggs my friend has. Eggs were pedestrian and could be replicated at home and the bread with \"angry goat cheese\" as waiter put it was bad.

It was the perfect sweet component to brunch.<br><br>The lobster hash was very tasty and had plenty of good lobster chunks that werent rubbery.  The salad was good but not a stand out compared to the waffle or sprouts.<br><br>For dinner, we arrived early because my plane was departing early evening.  The dishes arrived quickly to accommodate and I was sincerely grateful.  We ordered the grilled octopus, hearts of palm salad, caramelized sprouts again, broiled salmon, caramel cookie jar dessert and the gelato of the month.<br><br>We had one of the stand out dishes of our entire Chicago trip here... the grilled octopus.  We were told they marinated the octopus overnight before grilling it to get the charring and crispiness on the outside.  Honestly... it's incredibly flavourful and tender.  I loved this dish... the smokiness from the grill wasn't overwhelming but just enough to compete with the sweet acidity of the balsamic.  The crispy potato chips was just extra ... I could have eaten more of this.  We tried the octopus at Bar Siena just days before... how did it stack.  Siena Tavern definitely was the winner.<br><br>The hearts of palm salad was a bright beautiful salad... was it amazing.  It was good but the visual colours made it the most exciting.  I do love blood orange so I'm a bit bias.  Definitely a good bright light flavourful salad for the hot summer days.<br><br>The sprouts proved to be a 2 time winner... baconny goodness from the pancetta and the crispy sweetened caramelized sprouts.  So good!<br><br>The salmon was good ... was it the best we had in Chicago.  Oddly enough ... no.  The salmon was well cooked but compared to Bar Siena... it just wasn't as good.  I did love Siena Tavern's take better though... I found the tamarind glaze, carrots, and lentils a better match to the salmon than Bar Siena.  So it's a tie between the two restaurants.<br><br>For desserts, we had the gelato of the month, Peanut Butter & white chocolate and the crazy indulgent Caramel Cookie Jar.  We had a lot of gelato here in Chiacago... Black dog is a favourite but Siena Tavern's gelato of the month is on par.  The peanut butter flavour was really pronounced without being Jiify PB sweet.  It was more on the savoury side but it had a good sweetness at the end from the white chocolate.  Honestly... one of my favourite non traditional gelato flavours this year.  The caramel cookie jar was over the top... freshly baked caramel cookies that were crispy edges and softer interior and you could dip them into the nutella mousse... did I go into a sugar coma? Yes... was it worth it? Oh yes!<br><br>Overall, great restaurant to go for brunch and dinners.  Service is warm and inviting while the food is just as good.  It's not fine dining but it's a place you'd want to keep coming back to try more options.  Next time I'm in Chicago, I'll give the halibut and pizza a try!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WQPbd5mJ71pQnP9U8a6Heg/348s.jpg", "caption": "One of the best PB gelato I've had...

We also put in our pasta orders. I ordered the Orecchiette (prosciutto sausage, watercress, chili flake, pecorino cheese). My friend ordered the Carbonara in a jar- gemelli, crispy pancetta, parmesan cream, spinach, egg yolk, pecorino. She ordered it without the Pancetta and the server said instead they'll add peas. <br>We got our Coccoli order fairly quickly and we just devoured those. The dough was crispy on the outside and soft inside. So, good. Prosciutto would've really made it even tastier but it was still great without it. Then we waited for our pasta dishes, and we waited and waited some more. They were fairly busy but after putting our order it took about 40 mins to finally get the food. I mean it's pasta. <br>When we finally got the food it was very underwhelming. My Orecchiette was undercooked. They  might have been going for al dente but it was a bit too undercooked for my taste. The flavors didn't wow me either. My friend's pasta was even more undercooked than mine. The peas were almost crunchy. At least mine was somewhat edible. I asked her to send it back and she's like I'm starving and I'm not waiting another hour to get my food. We were talking about how disappointing this has been after our long wait. <br>Then a gentleman who I believe is the manager(sorry I can't remember his name) stopped by and asked how everything is. Well, I wasn't going to lie so I told him my friend's pasta was undercooked. He seemed genuinely concerned. We told him we didn't want to send it back b/c of the wait time and by that time she ate half of it anyway. He apologized again and said he'll take care of it and it's going to be on the house which was super nice of him.<br>Then we ordered a dessert to share -the peach creme Brûlée. It seemed like it's been sitting there for a while and not freshly made b/c the top wasn't even warm. But it was still really good and both of us liked it. <br>When the server came over with our check she apologized again and said the dessert was on her as well. We were pretty impressed by how the staff totally turned around a not so great experience . We thanked her and tipped her very generously. <br>When we left, the gentleman who stopped by our table was at the door and he apologized again and we were impressed by how nice  the staff was to us. <br>So, both of us walked out talking about how we should comeback and give it another shot.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Our meal here was absolutely delicious and the food was wonderful!!

It's a nice space and well run with attentive service. With that said basically nothing here has really wowed me. The wine list could use some work. Many of the wines they serve by the glass are below average and overpriced. I hate it when you pay 90% of a bottle price if you were to buy it yourself and then get a somewhat skimpy pour for the cost point. I will say they do have wonderful stemware so they do have that! The food to me as a whole is nicely done but nothing that I have tried has overly impressed. Basically to me this is just another overpriced River North establishment. Finally the valet is $15 although he said I was there over 3 hours so it was $23. I pointed out that the sign on his stand said 4 hours or less was $15. He then said well you have been here over 4 hours (as I went to the theater he was correct) but I mention I was over 4 hours by 5 minutes and I have been waiting 15 minutes to get my car.

The famous appetizer of fried dough with prosciutto and gorgonzola is delicious, because of course it is.

She was very knowledgable and helped validate the food and drink choices that we made. <br><br>For drinks, my husbands friend and I had the number 30 cocktail, and my husband had the Siena draught. The number 30 cocktail was a tequila-grapefruit-mango drink, and delicious in the way you could drink it like juice and never realize you finished your drink so fast (until the tequila hits). It wasn't necessarily weak in alcohol, but it really disguised the alcohol flavor, so if thats what you like you will like this one.

The atmosphere was bright, exuberant, and professional (it seemed as if many business folks from nearby buildings were dining there). There were at least two rooms: a main dining room and a bar. The bar room was hedged by large windows on two sides lined with tall tables. The bar dominated the middle of the room and had stools all around. Katie was my bar tender and she won me over with her friendly personality and keen recommendations. It's because of her that I passed on a table and chose to remain at the bar once my friend arrived.<br><br>I started my midday meal with the No. 22 cocktail. Although Katie explained that Siena Tavern is well-known for their wine list (and it certainly was impressive) she pointed out the carefully formulated cocktails. They ALL appealed to me. I was intrigued that they had violet bitters, lavender, honey, sage or basil incorporated into every concoction. Katie selected the No. 22 for me. The ginger and lime were bright but the Johnny Walker Black made it mature and interesting. Finally, the Kriek Lambic contibuted a hint of innocent sweetness.<br><br>I eagerly chose the Restaurant Week menu. First I ordered the beet salad which is not quite as the menu described. The menu indicates that the beets are glazed. They just may be; however, they were not glazed in a way that was recognizable to me. They seemed to be covered in a creamy dressing. Also, the menu fails to mention that the beet salad is served with arugula. I LOVE the fresh, spicy, peppery taste of arugula; however, I quickly discovered that my friend hates the stuff. He would have been displeased with that surprise so I thought I'd mention it here.<br><br>I selected the Butternut Squash Tortellacci. Tortellacci are like the giant version of baby tortellini. As described, these were stuffed with butternut squash. It was very sweet and almost dessert-like. The pasta and the browned butter sauce with bits of fried sage helped to temper it a little but I suspect that it only made it more rich than it already was. I was happy to be introduced to this dish; however, I think that it makes for a confusing entree.<br><br>Lastly, I had tiramisu gelato. It had large pieces of cake-like lady fingers mingled with the coffee, maple-y flavor of the creamy gelato. It was a splendid rendition and I can't imagine any improvements on the dessert.<br><br>One strange occurrence ensued during my meal at Siena Tavern that I think is worth noting. Our entrees were ready and served while we were only midway through our appetizers. Katie confessed that the kitchen sometimes times dishes like that. I had higher expectations of Siena Tavern as they have a reputation for excellence. I felt pressured to finish my beet salad so that I could enjoy my butternut squash tortellacci while still hot.

My 1st course was the butternut squash soup with truffled chestnut gremolata. The soup was superb! The gremolata reminded me of a pesto and added a nice flavor to the soup. Others in my party ordered the two different salads and the chopped salad looked great. My 2nd course was the grilled chicken sandwich topped with crispy pancetta bacon, smoked mozzarella, argula, sliced tomato, and piquillo pepper aioli all on a brioche bun. The grilled chicken sandwich was good but not my favorite. Standard fries accompanied the sandwich. I did try some of the tavern burger and preferred it over the grilled chicken. The burger was a bit greasy but it was fantastic. I especially enjoyed the crispy kale that sits under the burger. I also tried a slice of the burnt pepperoni pizza and boy oh boy was it delicious.

But frankly, having had better Italian food, didn't wanna dilute the standards by rating high just because of that one aspect. So I went here with my husband for his birthday, they were extremely graceful about the occasion, gave one of the best seating and wished him. We are vegetarians, so another reason this place has a high rating could have something to do with their meat dishes. Anyway we started off with a watermelon salad with 2 kinds of aioli, this was he only dish my husband described as heavenly; for myself, there was a tinge of parsley taste coming so not something I favored. The burrata was one of the worst I've had, because they decided to layer it off with a smoky sweet tomato jam which killed its taste. The roasted cauliflower was again average. In the main course the pasta with leek(forgot the name) which is also supposed to have shrimps (removed for us as we are vegetarians) was highly recommended, so we ordered it and frankly hated it; couldn't eat a bite. But the management was nice enough to enthusiastically take it off our bill(again great customer service). The pizzas were interesting, not so much the best. We had a half-half of truffle mushroom and some vegetarian pizza. They brought a birthday gelato with candle lighted and all for my husband, which gave us a special feeling. Overall I was still going to give this place a rating of 4, but the desserts just disappointed us. We had their most popular chocolate gelato cake and another item which was like frozen pistachio; the pistachio item was just interesting but I would never wanna eat it again; the chocolate gelato cake was too sweet, reasonably good but way too sweet. We did not try any drinks beside cappuccino and espresso which were well made; being a tavern drinks must be one of their specialties resulting in their high rating as well. Just going by the items we had, great experience in terms of the friendliness and special feeling, but I've certainly had way better Italian food.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I'm a proud supporter of Team Fabio, and coming here was on my bucket list.  It was a Friday afternoon during lunch time and it was slammed, but luckily we got a table without a reservation.<br>The meatball appetizer, there are no words.  It's huge, enough for 2-3 people, and so juicy.  I ordered the carbonara in a jar for my meal, and I love the way they present it at your table, then shake it in front of you.  It was creamy and super delicious.

OMG to die for, had a little bit of heat but just perfect for my Arizonan taste buds. I will not tell my wife what she missed as she will kill me as we never go out for pasta.

Typically, I do my own restaurant research (shocker), but this time, I felt it best to leave it in the locals' hands. Without hesitation, their response was Siena Tavern, even going so far as to call it their favorite. I'd never heard of it, and neither had any of my colleagues in New York (for whatever reason, they were very interested in where we were going to eat). No matter - I was at the mercy of the Windy Citizens now.<br><br>The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the uber-trendy decor - part Crate and Barrel catalog, part reality show date location. The second was the sheer size of the place, space for days with a private party going on in the back complete with its own bar. Our waitress was immediately the epitome of Midwestern charm - smiley, bubbly, super attentive, and ultimately a ninja, popping up unexpectedly and often throughout our meal.<br><br>When we placed an otherwise strong order to split as a table, I internally scoffed at the Heirloom Carrot Salad pick from one of our more health-conscious co-workers. To say the dish took me completely by surprise is an understatement. I don't love carrots, and with such a meat-centric menu, I pretty much planned on glossing over the salad section. But this - the titular veggies tossed with broccolini, shaved squash, goat cheese, Marcona almonds, and Cabernet vinaigrette - was fantastic. I scarfed this salad down and can confidently say it was my favorite thing I sampled at Siena Tavern.<br><br>I had my eyes on the Wagyu Beef Meatball since first visiting the website and I was treated to a huge and deliciously blended sphere of meat, covered in roasted tomato sauce and topped with ricotta and basil. I was happy to see our Carne Pizza, a quattro-hog topping experience (housemade fennel sausage, pancetta cured bacon, sopressata, and prosciutto sausage), served as thin crust and none of that deep-dish nonsense. The Squid Ink Linguini had a lot of promise, containing both a grilled lobster tail and spicy lobster cream sauce, but it was served lukewarm and the temperature may have hurt the dish for me. Hey, I'll take three out of four any day, so no harm, no foul here.<br><br>The clientele while I was in town was unsurprisingly a very business lunch crowd, and I see how Siena Tavern appeals to Chicago yuppies come happy hour or weekend brunch. This also explains why my fellow New Yorkers were unfamiliar with the place, perhaps appearing outside of tourist must-do lists and under strict local jurisdiction. Take the insider tip I was given and check out Siena Tavern when looking to get off the prescribed out-of-towner path, and live like a local, even if it's just for a lunch.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Went to Siena Tavern for Sunday brunch.

Our party of 5 was seated immediately (had a reservation for 9:45pm on a Saturday). The restaurant is loud which is perfect for their friendly, welcoming atmosphere--almost like a big Italian family talking over each other at dinner. Speaking of, the plates are meant to be shared family style which I love instead of being tied down to one entree. Everything we ordered was perfectly seasoned and delicious.<br><br>Our waitress was a very sweet, young woman who came by often to check on us. She informed us that they were out of meatballs which we were pretty upset about (considering the rave reviews)... but 10 minutes later she came back to tell us they had prepped some more! This actually made me feel even better that everything is prepared fresh and you can taste it in their food.<br><br>This is a great place for dinner with friends or a date (if you don't mind the noise).

Sometimes I partake. <br><br>... okay, okay. I guess I always partake... because somehow food just tastes better when your boss (or anyone but yourself) buys it. And because team building... yeah, that's the reason. Team building. Totally because of the team building. <br><br>So anyway, I mention the work lunch because that's how I became familiar with Siena Tavern, a place that apparently everyone else who's even one iota of hip has been to, heard of, or has on their list of 'must try' places. <br><br>I, on the other hand, had never heard of it (probably because it had three dollar $$$igns tagged on to it), nor did I understand why people were telling me to say hi to some Fabio character when I checked in, and to be completely honest, the way they spell Siena offends me in a way I can't explain... or at least can't explain well. I realize it's named after Siena, Italy, but that spelling makes me feel oddly uncomfortable... like when a person cuts a non-pie shaped piece from a pie and it makes you want to simultaneously fix the shape of the cut and knock out the person who took such a hap-hazard non-slice. moving on...<br><br>Danny W picked Siena Tavern. A place he'd previously raved about but that I absolutely never would've gone to outside of this lunch since I'm not a big fan of Italian food and because of the aforementioned $$$ price category... but I had to respect the guy (a little, at least) for having the balls to pick such a pricey place for a work lunch knowing we wouldn't have to fit the bill... not that I didn't pick a crazy expensive place when it was my work lunch pick (Medieval Times!), but I consider that to be different since my pick was both lunch AND a world-class show, and we were celebrating two team member birthdays, and also because I'm last on the lunch rotation and so far every Candice-picks-lunch day has either been canceled, or no one comes, so I felt like I got to save up red-headed-co-worker points and pull the lunch trump card when my day finally did arrive.  <br><br>So we've got a reservation for 6 and they give us this big-ass booth near a semi-private room and just across from the side bar. The place was definitely bumpin' at 12:30 in the afternoon, but the staff were on their A-Game and the atmosphere, while I imagine is probably much swankier at night, worked for a nice lunch spot as well... not too casual, but perfect for our purpose of a work lunch, and even better- they have an adjusted lunch menu with fewer items than dinner, but they're also priced much friendlier to the average person than an evening feast at Siena would have been. Lunch is somewhere between semi-budget friendly and semi-splurge-y, depending on who's footing the bill, of course.<br><br>My group started off with the Coccoli since the server was hyping it up as if she were Moses and the tablets read, 'though shall get the Coccoli'. When it came it wasn't exactly what I was expecting, and while I'll admit that I only had a bite, I thought it was just alright. Didn't really see what all the fuss was about. <br><br>Since my usual routine involves a coffee (with about half flavored creamer) at 10:30am and then lunch around 3:30/4 and our work lunch times usually center around 'normal' eating hours, I really only wanted something light so I could say that I did, in fact, eat here, so I went with the Farro Salad (grilled herb-marinated shrimp & calamari, green bean, roasted peppers, celery, basil, herb mustard vinaigrette). It tasted a lot more vinegar-y than I was expecting and had an odd dairy tinge to it that made my stomach turn a little - but in all fairness, I think this dish would be something a person who likes coleslaw would really love, because that's what it was most similar to in my eyes. A really nice, fancy coleslaw... unfortunately I don't dig coleslaw--at all, but I still managed to scarf most of my dish down for the sake of the shrimp and calamari that gave their little lives for it. <br><br>What I was sad I didn't get: The Squid Ink Linguini and the Lobster Roll with giant heaping chunks of lobster. I didn't get them because they were both upwards of $20 and as a person who frequents the Ramen aisle at Meijer, I didn't quite feel comfortable putting what seemed like such an extravagant lunch-time dish on the company dime... Luckily, Danny W didn't feel the same way and ordered up that $28 lobster roll and I'm only a little ashamed to admit I watched every bite as he devoured it. It looked... like heaven. It was stuffed to the brim and even Danny, who's quite the glutton, couldn't finish the last few bits of lobster that fell from him sammie. So when he wasn't looking I happily swooped in with my grabby fingers and plucked a few fallen pieces (along with some fries) from his plate. <br><br>I left with major regrets about not ordering that lobster roll but vowed to save up my pennies and come back on my own one day to do that damn lobster roll all on my own. All 28-totally-worth-it dollars of lobster roll.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HmxqI2idm1MrngzZFo8QEQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "Cocktails & bubbles menu"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/g0Rq56xlcLFCt2gjgDuW5A/168s.jpg", "caption": "Storefront"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/40vsJeRlhH-RoiiVRivjZg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Tavern Burger"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!<br><br>I've been here 3 times- most recently for my birthday dinner.

Upon check in, we were told that our table is just finishing up--their meal was complete and the bill paid--and to relax in the bar area, order a drink and when the table was ready I'd receive a text. I didn't mind this as it was an excuse to try one of their numbered cocktails before diving into wine. I opted for the number 8(?) -- the one with tequila. It was Awesome! My sister opted for just water and \"a sip\" of whatever I was getting. The sip quickly turned into a gulp than a guzzle before I ripped it out of her hand and reminded her that it's a $15 drink and to slow the F down. So after about 30 minutes I receive no text so I check in with the hostess who tells me that the couple at our soon-to-be table is staring longingly into each other's eyes and sipping on the rest of their wine and there's not much she can do. I was pissed but even keeled, yet I must have thrown a look or something because not 3 minutes after returning to the bar the manager came up to us to apologize for the wait/situation and offered us to start the  meal at the bar with an appetizer on the House.

To start, definitely order the coccoli. I'm serious, there's no question here, just order it. The coccoli is nice and crispy on the outside and so soft and airy on the inside. There's a glaze of truffle honey, which is indescribable, it's so good. It's also served with prosciutto and stracchino cheese, which is almost an embarrassment of riches at this point. Chef Fabio, you've really put something truly remarkable together here!  We also ordered the bone marrow, which we knew we wanted as soon as we saw it on the menu. Don't be frightened, the bone marrow is remarkably soft and is perfect as a spread on the crispy bread it's served with. <br><br>For our entrees, we got the squid ink linguini and the short rib ravioli. Just like the coccoli, you have to order the squid ink linguini. Just do it. No questions asked. The fresh pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was aromatic and had a nice kick without being overwhelming. The lobster was just slightly overdone, but even that did little to take away from this amazing dish. The short rib ravioli was also very good. The texture and flavor was spot on. <br><br>We couldn't leave Siena Tavern without trying a pizza so we ordered the truffle mushroom pizza, which certainly did not leave us disappointed. Every component was amazing: the roasted mushrooms, the garlic cream mozzarella, and the drizzle of truffle oil.  We ended our evening by ordering the bomboloni, which are fried doughnuts that you inject with delicious sweet sauces. <br><br>The food was excellent, and the service was friendly and personal.

Tuscan kale salad, truffle mushroom pizza, ahi tuna, hamachi, king crab, squid ink linguini, caramelised brussels sprouts, and sticky parmesan potatoes. Everything was cooked perfectly but I think my favourites were the ahi tuna and squid ink linguini. We didn't stop there however, dessert was also ordered. Caramel cookie jar, monkey bread and chocolate gelato cake. All, once again were finger licking good! Siena Tavern is located in River North, so it is a bit on the pricier side.

Our waitress was very helpful and super friendly.<br><br>I enjoyed the appetizers more than the entrée. We got the recommended coccoli, wagyu beef meatball, two different mozzarellas, and the truffle mushroom pizza to start.  While there was nothing wrong with the coccoli, it was not memorable and found it to be rather simple. I enjoyed the meatball, as it was massive and tasty. However, at the same time, it somewhat reminded me of lunch meat, because of its tender texture. It would have been great if there was some crunch or hardier texture to it. The mozzarellas were fresh and splendid. The mushroom pizza was the best, as even my boyfriend who is not a fan of mushrooms enjoyed it.<br><br>I had the jar in a pasta. While it was indeed a cool presentation (as with everything else), being brought out literally in a jar and then shook up by our server, it again was not very memorable. It was tasty and had decent duck flavor, but there was a sweetness to it that did not work for me. I think there are better entrees to be tried here. I would have given four stars, except a member of our group ordered the double cut pork chop, medium to medium rare, and it came out nearly well done. This should definitely not happen in a nice place like this and expected better.<br><br>I got the popular tiramisu and since it was my birthday celebration, I was surprised with complimentary birthday flavored gelato. The gelato was surprisingly good and not too sweet and had the perfect consistency. The tiramisu was great, tasted rather light and was robust in coffee flavor, and of course was presented beautifully, with the Siena tree logo in coffee grounds.<br><br>Prices are on the higher end but it is River North and thought their portions were rather generous, especially for a fancier place. <br><br>Very glad I tried this place and will return but definitely not in a hurry to do so.

We were with friends and could hardly carry on a conversation across the table. The minute we stepped outside my ears were ringing and I had the quiet sense of calm again. <br><br>I like their large Italian menu. There is something for everyone. My favorite part is the Mozzarella Bar. I chose the Burrata, classic and simple. I enjoy the taste of Burrata and not all the fluff and extras that sometimes accompany this dish. We also ordered the Shaved Brussels sprouts. Not impressed with a pile of sprouts. I would have preferred a bit more char to mine. The Truffle Mushroom pizza was pretty good. Anything with truffle (and enough truffle you can taste), is pretty tasty. Then, you cannot come to an Italian restaurant without trying some pasta. This time around I went with the Tagliatelle.

Definitely a great way to enjoy Siena's amazing fare. <br><br>I only tried one cocktail, the #2, it was light and refreshing and I'd definitely recommend it. <br><br>Now onto the food... I was lucky enough that I got to try a bunch of different things because we had a large group and each was more delicious than the last! <br><br>A friend and I shared the coccoli and the bufala mozzarella for our appetizers. I have never experienced anything like the coccoli but it legitimately melted in my mouth. It was an amazing flavor combo, if you get it make sure you make use of the honey it's served with. Also worth nothing is the presentation, I loved how the app came on a giant wooden block, very fun. The bufala mozzarella was also outstanding. The sea salt, tomato jam and basil oil highlighted the cheese perfectly and the cheese so fresh. I also have to say I was really happy with the portion sizes of both appetizers. Both came with enough for four servings but could be split in half to have as many as eight servings.<br><br>For my meal I chose the proscuitto fig pizza. It was a great flavor combination and I loved how fresh and light the figs were on the pizza. It was also an enormous portion with eight substantial slices, definitely a good pick! <br><br>I also was lucky enough to try the gnocchi, parmesan sticky potatoes and artichoke gratin. I don't usually like gnocchi but I could not get enough of the gnoochi at Siena Tavern.  The sauce was creamy and wonderful and the gnocchi were light as pillows that simply melted in your mouth. The artichoke gratin also melted in your mouth. It was like mac and cheese with artichokes, seriously amazing. Finally I fell in love with the parmesan sticky potatoes. They did not spare on the cheese or the seasoning and the potatoes were perfectly cooked, light and crispy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. <br><br>The final topper of the meal were the amazing donuts with dipping sauces. They were lightly fried balls doused in powdered sugar served with a variety of amazing dipping sauces (I'd recommend putting the chocolate and carmel together).

They actually built a full Swedish farm inside. It was a truly amazing experience. <br><br>When I walked in I was greeted by a server with a tray of delicious looking apps. She told me it was Coccoli, which meant nothing to me. I took one bite and was sent to heaven. I immediately knew I had just bitten into something special. I looked at the server and said, \"Who is catering this event?\" And she said, \"Siena Tavern!\" I said, \"That was delicious!\" She then told me that there was tons of food on the other side, after the tour through the Stuga! I must admit I have never tasted such flavor in a piece of catered food. The coccoli was a sweet puff pastry with sweet cheese like a ricotta and a slice of Procuitto on top with greens and a drizzle of something sweet. That is my guess on the ingredients because I didn't have a menu in front of me. I could hardly wait for my tour of the Stuga to finish, so I could sample more of this incredible food.<br><br>During the event the food kept coming and there was plenty of it. I loved how the servers were actual Siena Tavern employees which meant they knew the food they were serving. My second favorite thing of the night was the Kobe meatball. It was covered in a delicious red sauce, ricotta & fresh basil. These things just melted in my mouth. I learned that at lunch I could get a meatball sandwich or for dinner I could get a 12 ounce giant meatball as an appetizer. Can I get both? Yeah it was that good. Again this was delicious food was at an event.  This never happens. <br><br>The most interesting item I tried was the cooked venison on a stick. I've never had deer and I've never had a desire to eat Bambi. But tonight I figured I would put Siena Tavern to the test. You want to know what? It was delicious. It was topped with two crispy potatoes. And those potatoes were still crispy. Again I've never had crispy potatoes at an event. I even grabbed the last one off the tray, so it should have been cold and soggy but it wasn't. <br><br>I also loved the roasted tiny red peppers that had yummy cheese and chorizo inside. Again I didn't have a menu, so I'm gonna call it yummy cheese. I would love to make something like this at home. <br><br>The gnocchi was so good.  I'm not usually a fan but these housemade gnocchi were out is this world.  I think I was really in love with the house made pancetta. It's like bacon but a hundred times better!  They also were serving a small crostini with asparagus on top. It wasn't my favorite and because it wasn't easy to eat standing up with 500 people looking at me. I had a little taste but I didn't finish it.  I had to dislike something because everything was so good. <br><br>The servers just kept coming with more and more food. As I was standing there, I noticed the Chef Kevin Abshire was standing there looking at the event floor. I leaned over to him and said, \"Best Catered food I ever had in my life!\" He got a big smile on his face and said, \"Thanks!\" We had a great talk about food. I even learned that they were also cooking food onsite in a tent outback. No wonder everything tasted amazing. I wish all caters cared this much when serving food to a crowd. After talking the Chefs ear off, he obviously hasn't read one of my long winded reviews, he had to get back to work. He even made sure to tell me to call him when I finally eat inside there location. <br><br>I thought the night of food was over and then they brought out hot donuts. Stop it! I had to grab one of these delicious bites. It was so good that I had to have another one. In fact, there were 3 different flavors. I highly recommend you order these. I was informed they are available at the restaurant.<br><br>If you are looking to impress your guests with amazing food, then I would highly recommend the Siena Tavern prepare the food you.

Our server was super sweet and gave us some yummy recommendations and here is what we shared and loved:<br><br>Coccoli-Crispy dough, stracchino cheese, prosciutto di parma, truffle honey, so amazing the dough was super fluffy and the prosciutto just melts in your mouth, you get four pieces for $14 so it's definitely worth it, this is a unique and must try dish here.<br><br>The tavern burger- Because I just can't resist something with tomato jam, this burger has fontina cheese, tomato jam, baby arugula, crispy pancetta, herb aioli on a brioche bun for $16. It seems a little pricey but it is amazing, one of my favorite dishes here, and it's super big with fries so you can easily share this dish.<br><br>Truffle Mushroom Pizza- Roasted wild mushrooms, garlic cream, mozzarella, white truffle oil. How can you go to an Italian place and not try their pizza. It was good but not the best that I've ever had but for $18 it has like 8 pieces so you won't be left hungry, that's for sure. I would definitely try one of their pastas next time instead of the pizza since it was just so so but we were full beyond belief by this point after all the carbs.<br><br>Tiramisu- For $9, the dish was presented beautifully, one of the prettiest I've ever seen, like with a Sienna Tavern tree logo made out of cocoa, just beautiful. This is made of roasted white chocolate and espresso meringue.

We were getting a little stuffed but I so wanted one of their enticing desserts.  We finally decided on the interactive bomboloni.  Four Italian style donuts with little tubes for you to squeeze in the fillings - whiskey caramel, chocolate hazelnut, and raspberry chianti.  Besides the gelato, this was one of the more lighter desserts they offered.  I loved how \"interactive\" it was and they were tasty, abeit a teeny bit oily, but that's how those bombolonis are.  We didn't taste the whiskey in the sauce, but I loved the raspberry and chocolate hazelnut sauces.       <br><br>We told Sam, who later got a manager for us, that we hope they open one in SF because they would make such a killing!  They are opening soon in Miami and next in LA...hopefully SF will be in the works in the next 5 years.  Loved the mod and dark tones of this beautiful, delicious, affordable top notch restaurant.  If you want a break from the pizza and meat in Chicago, definitely head to Siena Tavern.  Of course we saw a mix of clientele, from a teenager having a birthday party here, families, and friends dining as well, but the decor makes for a cute date night restaurant.  Our favorite restaurant on our trip for sure.  Make reservations because they get busy!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Decided to pop on for a late dinner when we saw that the place was seriously hopping on the street.

Tiramisu French Toast doesn't really have much espresso or cream flavor to it, but it's still a sweet but not to sweet breakfast item (and healthy-ish because it comes with berries).  Lobster hash comes with fresh lobster, but you certainly pay for it and don't get much food in the dish (would skip next time).  The truffle gnocchi is supposed to be a Chef Fabio's signature dish, but the flavor of truffle cannot carry a dish on it's own, and I think it falls flat due to bland flavor.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This was my second time dining at Siena Tavern.

You make a little sandwich and it totally rocks. I've also really enjoyed the burrata, which comes with a tasty tomato jam and delicious grilled garlic bread. For pizza, I've tried both the burnt pepperoni and the truffle mushroom. I have to say, I really preferred the burnt pepperoni. It was incredibly flavorful, totally recommend. Pastas, the gnocchi is a very unique dish, but very rich, so I definitely recommend sharing this one. I also really enjoyed squid ink linguini and rigatoni with lamb sausage. Apparently, you can order their pastas in half orders which is helpful to know! Others in my party got the pork chop and brick chicken, they were huge hits...particularly those sticky potatoes that come with the chicken!<br><br>Now, dessert.

It sounds like it would be overwhelming, but it wasn't. It also wasn't as heavy as I thought it would be.<br><br>I had the truffled gnocchi for lunch (it was a heavy dish with a cream sauce, probably better for dinner).

It was the perfect amount of food. The tomato jam was slightly sweet and beautifully offset the creamy burrata. The gnocchi simply melts in your mouth. I thought the combination of truffle, sage and pancetta was perfect. You could taste all three but none of these ingredients overwhelmed the others. The brick chicken was mostly boneless which made it easy to share, and we couldn't stop eating the potatoes that accompanied it. I also loved the garnishes of balsamic roasted garlic and grilled lemon. It was all delicious.<br><br>We were stuffed and didn't save room for dessert, so next time, we'll order more light dishes so we can try the bomboloni (donuts you inject with squeeze bottles of sauces). I could really have a good time with those squirt bottles.<br><br>The bar area looks like a fun place to have a cocktail after work (and I'm sure it's quite the scene) and my favorite part was the \"wall of herbs\" behind the bar.

I do, though, like quoting random Austin Powers movie quotes. This brings me to being addicted to Siena's #2 cocktail: prosecco, Grey Goose, peach, lemon, and some other goodies. Of the times I've been here so far, that's my go-to drink. I mean, it has prosecco, which can do no wrong in my eyes or palate. They also have a decent wine menu too. For reds, I dig their malbec option. The bar area is definitely a good spot to meet friends for drinks.

Had I known when I took that bite that Siena Tavern was the new Italian restaurant of chef Fabio Viviani...well, let's just say there would have been some squeals involved. I'm a huge Top Chef fan and the charming Viviani of Season 5 won Fan Favorite for a reason. I had no doubt that my gnocchi was just a small taste of the amazing food Fabio had in store for Chicago.<br><br>Situated on the corner of Kinzie and Dearborn, Siena Tavern fits perfectly into Chicago's trendy River North neighborhood. Lucas Stoioff and David Rekhson of Bull & Bear and Public House are no strangers to this 'hood, and they know how to do it right.<br><br>Our reservation was at 6:30p on a Friday and we arrived early to grab a drink and check out the bar area before dinner. At 6p the place was seriously hoppin'...from business professionals grabbing a drink after work to girls dressed like they were ready to hit the club...it was quite the mix of people.<br><br>We were able to grab a spot at the bar and try a few of their Femme du Coupe cocktails. I tried the #2 and the #4. Both on the sweeter side, one made with vodka and the other with gin. I thoroughly enjoyed both, but the #4 with plymouth, lavender honey, lemon, and creme de violette was definitely my fav. By 6:30p the wait for walk-ins was almost 2 hours...if you don't have a reservation I'd suggest stalking the bar patrons and swoop in once they're ready to leave-like I said, we snagged a couple seats at the bar less than 10 minutes after arriving.<br><br>Once our reservation time rolled around we were seated at one of the half-circle booths in their large, open dining room. We had a group of 4 and the booth was perfect; we had more than enough room and the arrangement made for intimate conversation while letting us take in the beautiful space around us.<br><br>The service we experienced was outstanding-our server Karissa was so friendly and had great suggestions, she coursed our dishes perfectly, and our water glasses were never empty. The plates at Siena are smaller and made for sharing. I think a group of 4 is the perfect size if you're looking to maximize the number of dishes you can try while still getting a decent portion of each.<br><br>We started with a few smaller plates:  the Burrata from their Mozzarella Bar, served with a delicious tomato jam and grilled bread; the Saba Roasted Bone Marrow with pickled maitake mushrooms and crispy bread; and the Siena Chopped Salad. The salad was good but the Burrata and Bone Marrow were major standouts. I will definitely be ordering both of these again when we return (because we'll obviously be returning).<br><br>We followed up our \"starters\" with a few pastas. We tried the Short Rib Ravioli, Squid Ink Linguini, and Gnocchi. Again, they were all incredibly delicious and picking a favorite is nearly impossible, but I think the linguini stood out the most for me. The rich, meaty ravioli and velvety truffle cream gnocchi were both dishes I would absolutely order again. However, the subtle spice of the lobster cream sauce on the linguine was what really did it for me. Plus, I think I just love eating squid ink linguini!<br><br>We would've loved to go on trying more of the pastas, but we were told it would be wise if we left room for some of their fantastic desserts. We went with the Tiramisu and the Bomboloni. The Tiramisu is Fabio's grandmother's recipe and grandma did not disappoint! I like to think of myself as somewhat of a Tiramisu connoisseur because I try it everywhere.  Siena Tavern's rendition is without a doubt one of my favs. Rich and creamy yet it still feels light when you take a bite. Tiramisu perfection!<br><br>The Bomboloni is also worth a sweet splurge at the end of your meal. Warm, airy dough covered in sugar and served with 3 different sauces in squeeze bottles-yes, you want this.

I hardly see squid ink pasta, so I was so excited to try his take. The pasta was SO fresh and the right dente-ness, had plenty of lobster chunks including a tail on top. The portion was also really nice for what was going to be a heavy brunch altogether.

The fries were some of the best that I've had, as it wasn't salty at all, had cheese on it and you are provided with ketchup and a lemon/garlicky mayo. <br><br>Finally, we ended our meal with their bomboli, which is a fun interactive dessert: 4 fried donuts that come with 4 sauces in squeeze bottles.

He has never been a fan of honey, but the honey they put on this dish is out of this world. I'm not sure where they source it from, but there is definitely something to be said about good ingredients. <br><br>Ossobuco - This dish is big enough to share between 2 people if you order a 2-3 other small plates. There is nothing I don't like about this dish, but my absolute favorite is that bone marrow that they serve with a small fork. The meat is flavorful and literally melts in your mouth. I particularly like that they serve this with farro mushroom risotto -- infusing umami every way possible into this dish! <br><br>From the crudo bar, we have tried the ahi tuna andhamachi -- both solid dishes, but the portions are small so I don't know it's worth the value. <br><br>This place gets packed and is always booked up. I highly recommend a reservation if you want to sit in the dining area. The bar area is first come, first serve.

Service was friendly and attentive, and our server was a very chill guy who seemed to know his stuff.<br><br>To start, we had a pear and prosciutto pizza and the coccoli. The pizza was fantastic, definitely up there with the likes of Balena, etc. Good crust, and toppings were a great combo. The coccoli was one of the best things I've ever had. It is a must-try at Siena Tavern. Such a simple concept, but so, so delicious. The crispy dough was heavenly, the cheese rich and creamy, and the truffle honey... don't even get me started. So good! Sweet with just the right essence of truffles. Great start to the meal!<br><br>For our entrees, we chose the pasta in a jar, gnocchi, squid ink linguine, and the osso buco. The pasta in a jar was good, but not outstanding. The pasta itself was perfectly al dente, but I felt like the flavors were a little bland. There was blue cheese in this dish, but you'd never know after eating it (I don't like blue cheese, so this worked out fine for me). The squid ink linguine was very good, and had a nice bit of lobster on top. However, the gnocchi was definitely the best pasta dish of the three we ordered. The gnocchi were perfect little pillows, soft and chewy and creamy. Just delicious. The sauce was both rich and light at the same time, and had great flavor of truffles. This dish was definitely the star on our table. The osso buco was also well prepared. Big piece of tender veal, lots of marrow in the shank bone, and a healthy scoop of farro risotto. Our only complaint about the entrees was that a couple--the pasta in a jar and the osso buco in particular--lacked salt. We asked for salt, which made each of these dishes so much better. If the kitchen can just season a tad bit better, all of these dishes would be stars.<br><br>Side dishes were good. We had the brussel sprouts and shishito peppers. The brussels were good, but the shishito peppers were very well prepared. I don't like spicy, and luckily all of the ones I ate were mild!<br><br>For dessert, we ordered the monkey bread, the gelato flight, and the bomboloni. Be aware, these portions are HUGE! The monkey bread was quite tasty, but a little difficult to eat because of how hard it was. The gelato flight was good, and is definitely a great way to sample Siena's many flavors. We tried salted caramel, s'mores, pistachio, and brown butter peanut. The brown butter peanut was the best in my opinion. S'mores was also very good. I found pistachio a little on the sweet side, and salted caramel could have used more caramel flavor. Of the desserts, though, the bomboloni were the best. These were huge beignet-like pieces of fried dough coated in sugar and served with \"Nutella,\" raspberry, and caramel sauces. Our server recommended we inject our bombolonis using the squeeze bottles the sauces were served in, which is a fun concept for this tasty dessert. I've never had fried dough that didn't taste good, but these bomboloni were a true hit. Slightly crisp on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside. Delicious. We were celebrating a birthday, and they brought us a big scoop of birthday cake gelato with a candle, which was a nice touch.<br><br>Overall, great experience at Siena Tavern. If I could make one complaint, it's that the menu is too broad! (Does this count as a complaint?) With only four people dining, it was so hard to make decisions on what to order, as literally everything sounded awesome. Family style is the way to do it here, folks, especially with such generous portion sizes. If I could, I would have tried one of everything.

Our server gave us recommendations/her favorites, which was good to hear since the menu has a lot to offer. <br><br>The 6 of us ended up sharing the farro pasta, margherita pizza, burnt pepperoni pizza, and mushroom pizza. 2 people also ordered the turkey panini and kobe meatball sandwich, but those were a little more difficult to share. Everything I tried was good, especially the pasta. However, I thought the pizza at La Madia on Grand was better. The pizza at Siena Tavern was definitely tasting, but seemed to be lacking that extra boost of flavor. It was also very, very soft so we all had to fold the pieces over so it wouldn't completely flop over. I had a taste of someone's fries as well, which were really good. <br><br>The service was great from everyone -- one of the managers stopped by to make sure everything was to our liking.

I'm used to just six on this style of pizza so that was a great surprise. <br><br>I also had the burrata and tomato jam and it too was delicious. The tomato jam was a little bit spicy and the cheese was creamy and fresh. Spread them both on the toast and you'll be in heaven. Huge portion too.

We all chose the same first course, the Harvest Salad. I thought it was great; bitter greens with sweet roasted butternut squash and candied hazelnuts contrasted by sour pomegranate seeds and Granny Smith apples all balanced with a balsamic glaze. My friends thought it was way too bitter and two of them didn't finish it. I had the chicken sandwich. It was good, but it's a chicken sandwich and fries. One friend had the burger, which was also good (although really salty) but again, it's a burger and they're not a burger place.

So why we needed a pizza as an \"appetizer\" was beyond me but whatever. Nor do I like pepperoni. However, I was able to sample the menu on somebody else's dime so why not!? LOL. The pizza was oily and delicious and the tomato sauce was spicy... like legitimately spicy!!! Yessss, it was a nice touch and I enjoyed it. Quietly, I wanted another slice but I had the will power to stop at one.<br>- My colleague had the kale salad... he enjoyed it. I can't speak on it much other than that.<br>- Three others at the table each ordered the meatball sandwich and devoured it! There was nothing left on their plates so I'm going to make a HUGE assumption and say that they loved it.<br>- I ordered the lobster roll. Our server, Devin, said that it was rated top (or one of the top) lobster rolls in the city. OK buddy... I'll be the judge of that. Full disclosure, I'm not generally a fan of lobster to begin with but lobster rolls are different (to me) and I tend to like them better than just dipping lobster in warm butter. It was good. Full of flavor and tons of lobster squeezing out of the roll. They didn't skimp on the portion... and you know lobster ain't cheap!<br>- Lastly, the fries... man, the fries were so tasty. Each sandwich came with them and they were topped with grated parmesan cheese. The cheese... gosh, I really never thought about grating parmesan on fries before... that's about to be my new thing! <br><br>Needless to say, I really enjoyed my FULL sized lunch at Siena Tavern. The service was good, the venue was really nice and large. There was outdoor seating as well as large booths (where we sat), a large bar area and high top tables... the seating options were robust. I will be back again for sure.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Best place I've been in Chicago!

The third was for brunch and it wasn't the greatest experience out of the three. <br><br>For dinner, I've had the waygu beef meatball, the coccoli, the mozzerella sampler, the cheese plate, the squid ink lobster linguini, the scallop risotto, and the lamb chops. All were excellent (especially the coccoli and cheese plate), except I thought the scallop risotto was too salty for my liking and just a little too rich. The lamb chops were grilled with a really nice char but a bit fatty (which lamb chops are sometimes). We ordered pumpkin gelato and espresso for dessert and both were superb (I'm a coffee and dessert snob). Loved our server both times for dinner. Didn't sound too robotic and made the experience really fun. <br><br>Now onto brunch. Went with 3 of my girlfriends (one who has a 7 month baby) on a Sunday. We were sat immediately with a reservation at a nice table in the bar, so we could kind of see the Bears game. Our server came over and sounded like a robot. No personality the entire time and didn't make it very fun. She actually made one of my friends feel somewhat uncomfortable. When we ordered, my friend ordered a side of fries with her salad. The server proceeded to ask her if she wanted the fries for the table to share. \"Um...no\" my friend responded. Awkward. If she wanted fries for the entire table to share, don't ya think she would of specified that?!? Anyways, our order was placed. <br><br>Then about 30 min later, our server came by again and explained to me that their waffle iron just broke and they couldn't make my Nutella waffles. Fine, it happens. She apologized and recommended something similar and I ordered it. Five minutes later, the rest of my parties food comes out and I sit there with no food. I mean she couldn't of told me earlier that the waffle iron broke so that I could of ate with the rest of my party? Or even offer me something to nibble on while I wait? This was definitely not the best experience I've had here, but given it is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago I will be back. I just wish they would of been more accommodating to the situation. They acted like they didn't care. If it wasn't for the great food they have, this would be a 2 star review.

Planning for my upcoming birthday brunch, I knew I wanted to pick a place that took reservations so I could avoid standing in the cold or squished in a small waiting area. I found Siena Tavern (already on my to-do list) was on Open Table and jumped immediately on the reso. <br><br>I was running a little late (I run on Cuban time) and was scared this trendy spot would be packed and would give up my table. I called and they were totally cool with me coming in 10 minutes late. <br><br>Upon walking in, I was already really happy I picked this place for my birthday brunch. It wasn't totally packed but still lively. In the main dining area, there were dark wood tables and tall booths with dark brown leather. Really cute, modern chandeliers hung from the ceiling. In another dining area, there were tables parallel to the windows that curved along the sidewalk. The crowd encompassed a mixture of young, hot 20-somethings (your typical River North-ers), a private party of middle aged women and a sprinkle of 30-40 y/o couples. <br><br>My friend and my hubby accompanied me and as soon as our booties touched the booth seats, our waitress came around. My friend contemplated ordering the ahi tuna and asked the waitress her opinion.The waitress honestly responded that the portions would've been really small and probably not filling at all, considering the price. I so appreciated her honesty and we proceeded with our orders.<br><br>I had already studied the menu (like the good yelper that I am) and suggested the fries and the benedict (aka green eggs!) to my hubby and friend and they listened. I had the truffle scrambled eggs, which should be no surprise for since I'm a truffle addict. YUM! They were perfectly cooked, with the perfect ratio of truffle in every bite. The dish also came with goat toast, basically thin bread with melted goat cheese on top. My hubby and friend LOVED their benedicts. My friend said she would've preferred regular hollandaise but my hubby said he enjoyed the pesto aspect. The fries were also pretty damn good since it came with an aioli sauce. <br><br>Very very full and satisfied with the service, food, decor, I really have no complains with Siena Tavern.

With all of the other claims and prices, they better be making everything in house. <br><br>My wife and I were there at 5:15 because, surprise!, that's the best reservation we could get and we wanted to try it. The decor is trendy, and the space has a very \"new\" and corporate feel. Nothing rustic that you might expect form the name, or the food. For some reason I kept thinking about Wildfire when we were in there. That is disappointing.<br><br>Our server was nice and we ordered some drinks and the meatball to start. So weird-- The meatball came immediately and the drinks took a while. The timing was odd. Why would they do that? The meatball came out, and I'm not joking, 60 seconds after our server walked away with our app and drink order.<br><br>There was a group of high school girls with one of their moms sitting next to us. They were talking about how they didn't have homecoming dates so this is what they were doing instead. I can totally appreciate that. There was this guy who was a server working there who would kind of stand around so the girls would notice him. How bruised must his ego be if he's striving for the attention of 16 year olds? It was creepy and also embarrassing. What a loser.<br><br>My wife had pappardelle bolognese and I had a spaghetti with crab. Both were good, although small. We weren't expecting some weird Maggiano's portions but we did turn down dessert. We didn't want to risk the disappointment. We were out of there by 6:30. The service was too fast and a poor experience. With tip, the bill was $125 or so.<br><br>Lastly, I want to say something about the crowd. At first, it felt as if everyone had come in from the suburbs to try this place. I realized that this was Fabio Viviani's place (I had to Google him before we went). This meant nothing to me and really continues to mean nothing to me. They use the Top Chef thing which has some serious marketing power and they are riding that hype well. There was just a strong JC Penney aesthetic in the clientele that you don't really come across at a lot of other downtown restaurants when you are off Michigan Avenue. <br><br>All in all, the vibe was bad because of the crowd was lame, the food was good but there wasn't enough of it, and the service was terribly timed and poorly executed.

Though it was a fairly spur-of-the moment decision, I had no difficulty securing a spot, even calling about 45 minutes or so ahead to reserve. I later learned from my server that there were 50 cancellations that day for lunch, so methinks that was the reason I was accommodated so promptly. <br><br>As to the food itself, the fare on offer here is right up my alley--modern classics, well presented and plated, with fresh ingredients. As I was studying my options on the menus ($33 and $22 fixed price menus for Restaurant Week lunch), I decided to take the edge off with a glass of wine. I went with the Malbec- an excellent pour that I knew would pair equally well with lighter and slightly heartier fare. The wine was just what the doctor ordered on this otherwise gloomy February day, with falling snow and falling stocks parading by on the CNBC ticker on the flat screen above my head. The menu offerings all looked promising but I was finally able to decide on my options--shaved brussel sprout salad with marcona almonds to start, shrimp risotto for the main, and salted caramel gelato for dessert. This is way more than I usually eat for lunch, but I knew what would be facing me outside (more snow and cold), running of errands, and an extended salon appointment.<br><br>All of the dishes were standouts, though I must say the risotto was among the best I've ever tasted. Risotto is easy to screw up, as it tends to get either gummy or granular. This was not the case at Siena, and the presentation (a couple of shrimp on top of the dish along with shrimp pieces within the risotto) was well executed. The dessert-salted caramel gelato-stole the show and is a worthy successor to the gelato offerings at Rhapsody (RIP). Siena's dessert chef makes the gelato in-house, so this is definitely a must try. I'll also point out that the service was extremely efficient. In fact, I was in and out of here in less time than at some fast-casual spots which shall remain nameless. <br><br>Sometimes, an indulgent experience at lunch is not optional, but required. From the excellent bites to the stellar service, last week's experience satisfied on all counts.

The GM came by twice to make sure everything was going well and that we were pleased.<br><br>Now on to the food. So delish! We started off with the burrata which I am a huge fan of. They paired it with a tomato jam which paired perfectly, slightly savory and sweet at the same time. We also shared the truffle and mushroom pizza, which is one of my favorite pairings. The truffle flavor was not super overpowering, which I know is one reason a lot of people shy away from it. <br><br>For entrees, I ordered the tortellacci, which I've never actually heard of.

The service was well beyond expectations, and my expectations were very high due to the layout and the price. They were very friendly, highly insightful on all the menus, always on top of things, and made sure we were 100% satisfied. Now onto the main topic... the food. Luckily I was with 5 other people and was able to try 6 different appetizers, main entrees, sides, beverages, and deserts. Every dish I had was mind boggling. From the Brick Chicken Diavolo (Which was my main course that I highly recommend) to the Margherita pizza, and the Gnocchi (which was also to die for, with a truffle cream sauce that was delectable enough to roll around in.) Then, just when you think you are stuffed to the brim, they hand you the desert menu and immediately tell you about their Bomboloni. 4 hand made, fresh donuts that are made to perfection. They bring them out in a bag with three sauce bottles filled with Whisky-Carmel, Chocolate Hazelnut, and raspberry chianti on the side to fill, or cover, your house mad doughnuts. They are amazing... an absolute must have. But, as I said early, I had the opportunity to taste 5 other deserts and I can safely say that the entire desert menu, just like the dinner menu, is insane. Everything on the menu is cooked perfectly. Now, as its own little segment in this review, I have to bring up their signature beer, the Siena .

The fig and honey in the burrata was good, but it's hard to mess up burrata.

The short rib ravioli was ok but again very rich and heavy. Probably was a result of the butter, red wine and mushroom sauce.  <br><br>A bit on the pricier side but to be expected given the neighborhood and celebrity chef.

Lunch was almost a year ago but I swear that I have had a love affair with that Italian sausage risotto ever since - I think about it all the time. The other night, a friend and I had dinner and I was also pleased with my meal. The Chianti was light and went perfectly with my meal. We split the coccoli, which I think is a perfect example of the inventiveness of the chef. Fried dough balls with honey, prosciutto, and cheese? Amazing. I liked my Farro Risotto entree but I actually liked the flavor of my friend's short rib ravioli better. The risotto was very hearty and was more monotone in terms of flavor and texture. <br><br>The reason I have to knock it down a star is because I have not felt welcome by the front of house staff either time. Both times there were at least 3 people at the host stand and they all seemed more interested in talking to one another or checking their computer screens than welcoming me. Luckily, this last visit, the manager stopped by our table and asked how things were (with genuine interest) and it made me feel a little better. We also had an extremely competent server, Kristy, who made us feel at home, answered my questions, and made great recommendations. <br><br>I do look forward to keeping this on my list of restaurants to try during restaurant week and on special occasions.

I wish we had gotten a booth - especially since those super high chairs still were too low for my comfort at the high table.  And the mirrors behind my wife's head were almost distracting!  But the kitchen was equally distracting for her.  The music was a touch too loud, BUT I was sick and couldn't talk very loud, so my slight annoyance with that was partially about the illness.  <br><br>The waitress gave us lots to think about on the menu.  They encourage sharing.  Love it.  Although she said the pizza was 10\" and could be an appetizer.  I know I'm not a large eater, but that seemed like a huge appetizer to me!  In the end we got the roasted beet salad, the gnocchi with fried sage and panchetta and the burnt pepperoni pizza.  <br><br>We were warned about the pizza.  We brushed it off.  But WHOA this is spicy.  But the spice seems to be mostly towards the center of the pizza so the bites after the first one were less heat-wise.  So amazingly good.  The gnocchi was PERFECT.  Though I'm happy we shared it because it would have been too rich to finish on my own.  <br><br>Looking at Open Table, the reservations are ridiculous at the moment.  But it won't stop me from calling occasionally to see if we can get in.  Programmed into my phone now is this place!  After a disappointment at Bavette's this place was exactly what I thought it would be and more!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Bottom line: I enjoyed myself here.

We took her advice when she steered towards a few things and they worked out well. For starters, we went with bone marrow and the truffle pizza. The bone marrow dish was good, not great. It dressed with balsamic. I guess we just kind of prefer ours simply prepared. Not bad though. The truffle pizza was tasty, but maybe not as great as the waitress implied. I had the leftovers the next day for a dope lunch. I'd easily get both dishes again though. <br><br>We went kind of heavy since we wanted to try the pastas here and were concerned with the portion sizes. We've become accustomed to tiny pasta dishes at these types of restaurants and we were both hungry. We shouldn't have worried becuase the portions were pretty good. Not maggiano's take home and feed your family for a week good, but good nonetheless. <br><br>The pastas we tried were the pappardelle with bolognese and the lobster with squid ink linguini. My wife liked the pappardelle more, I liked the linguini. Both were excellent. Too often, you find lobster overcooked and gross.

The bar area is fantastic, and you can usually score a couple seats for a quick drink. It also helps that the bartenders are incredibly friendly. I especially love their \"No. 2\" cocktail (all cocktails are $12) and their burrata pizza with marinated eggplant and zucchini ($16) for a nice post-work drink+nosh.

That is crap!  What Italian restauant doesn't give bread/oil to start with?  We started out with a plate of \"coccali\", which to me was pretty much a Crescent roll, with some cheese to spread on it and some meat.  you got 4, but for $16.00???  Eh, I thought that was a little high.  I then ordered the \"Lasagna\".  What came out of the kitchen was not what I expected.  it was a little Cast Iron Bowl which looked to be a combination of \"chili\" and \" French Onion soup\" with some lasagna noodles layering the inside.  it was ok, but really wasn't what i would expect when I order \"Lasagna\".

Why would I want to go eat somewhere and not be full?  To be honest, i walked out of there still hungry. <br>I just felt for the amount of money I spent ($100 before tip) i feel the portions were small, the prices were a bit high and you really don't get filled up.  There are much better Italian Restaurants in Chicago that will give you the basics or bread/oil, offer you a soup or salad with your meal and your entree would be a good size.  I only came beause my girlfriend chose this for our anniversary dinner spot.<br>Would I come back?  Sure, but i'd make sure I ate before i came.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I keep wishing we could come back to this place soon!  My husband and I stayed downtown a few weeks ago and happened upon this place for breakfast!  It was one of the most amazing places we had been for breakfast in a very long time.  The drinks were also amazing!  The service was outstanding!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Solid place!

I read previous reviews before we went to Siena Tavern and knew I was going to get a great meal... but this place far exceeded my expectations.<br><br>Six of us came here on a Saturday night before seeing a show. Even during our 5:30 reservation, the place was busy. First good sign. My sister-in-law and her boyfriend were running late, but my husband and I, along with my in-laws, got seated right away. We ordered drinks and our server offered up some suggestions for appetizers. Both my husband and I had the Siena Draft, a beer brewed specifically for Siena. We are both beer snobs, and thought this one was good. Not incredible, but good.<br><br>For an appetizer, we had the Grilled Octopus, which was delicious. We also ordered a couple cheeses -- the gorgonzola and the pecorino. Both were amazing, but the cheese portions are insanely small. There was actually only enough for one small piece of each cheese for each of us -- and for $7/cheese, I wasn't too pleased with that.<br><br>And then the best part... the actual meal! I was lucky enough to try most everything that everyone ordered, so here's my two cents:<br><br>- Pizza Bar: I ordered the Carne pizza (sausage, bacon, salami and more) and it was awesome. I would absolutely, 100% get this pizza again. My FIL ordered the Wild Boar pizza (butternut squash and a bunch of other things I don't really know) and it had the most unique taste for a pizza I've ever had. It had a sweetness to it. It was great, but I probably would never order it.<br><br>- Pasta: My husband ordered the Orecchiette, which had sausage, spices and pecorino cheese... and it was so good -- highly recommend. My MIL ordered the Pasta in a Jar. Normally, I would not try this because it has mushrooms in it, but everyone was saying what a unique taste it had, so I had to take a small bite. It was also very delicious. My SIL ordered the Gnocci, and it was by far the best dish I tasted that night. When I go back to Siena, I will definitely get this pasta.<br><br>- Meat: My SIL's boyfriend got the lamb, which I didn't try, but he said it was really great.

My favorite was the squid ink linguine with grilled lobster. Flavorful, creamy, delicately cooked lobster. The gnocchi was melt-in-your-mouth soft, and the sauce didn't have an over-abundance of truffle oil infused cream. I didn't find the prosciutto and pear pizza to be fantastic, nor was it in any way offensive.

Cannelini beans, pepperoncini, and especially the boar salami were delish.

Had to ask for more bread since it only comes with 3 pieces.<br><br>Gnocchi: This was SO rich and the favorite of the night. Yes we split this one gnocchi dish between 5 girls! But honestly, between the bacon, cream, and cheese I am not sure how someone could eat more than a little serving. Great melt in your mouth texture.<br><br>Burnt Pep pizza: The pepperonis were delicious (I wonder if they come from a local butcher here?) cut super super thin which crisped up nicely in the oven and had the perfect heat between the chilis and red pepper flakes. Would get this again in a heartbeat. Outer crust was nice and fluffy but the underneath crust could have held up a little more.<br><br>Pear and Prosciutto pizza: Great balance between sweet and savory. Thinly cut pear slices (they didn't taste grilled though...tasted more like they were red wine poached?) didn't overpower but added a great dimension. <br><br>A few of us ordered gelato...the standout was the tiramisu flavor.

We didn't have a reservation, so since all the tables in the main dining room were reserved, we decided to sit at the back pizza bar. What a great decision! We had THE BEST bartender/server. His name was Tariq and he was attentive, knowledgeable, and a genuinely great guy. He provided some recommendations, but we went with our tried and true favorites: the coccoli, grilled octopus, and burnt pepperoni pizza. The food came out quickly and was absolutely delicious (as always!!). We also ordered a great bottle of wine. After we finished eating, we drank our wine and debated dessert.  We were stuffed, but of course ordered some gelato, which is made in-house and is so delicious!! I recommend the tiramisu flavor and also ask for the birthday cake gelato if it's not on the menu--it's easily one of the greatest things I've ever eaten. Anyway, after we stuffed ourselves, we hung around a bit longer and enjoyed the rest of our wine. We sat and chatted for quite a while, but Tariq never rushed us and made us feel extremely welcome and comfortable. Even though he was super busy behind the bar, he never made us wait and treated us as if we were his priority. Best server ever! <br><br>Sure, Siena is a bit pricey (typical River North), but when it's consistently delicious and when the service is excellent, we really don't mind paying for an exceptional overall experience.

I left somewhat in limbo, hence the three star rating.<br><br>The decor and layout of the restaurant is awesome. Large, comfortable booths, two massive bars, and a rustic interior. I was a fan. The service was also fantastic--we had a friendly, attentive waiter that even noticed our table was a bit wobbly half way through the meal (slightly wobbly, but not enough for us to complain), and he came out to fix it.<br><br>The food is where I left wanting more, and it is the reason that I docked two stars. We started out with the coccoli, which comes highly recommended on yelp. I had no complaints. The fried dough was exceptional--crispy on the outside with a nice doughey-ness on the inside. The accompanying cheese was also delightful, and it had a nice freshness and a buttery consistency. Where this dish missed was in the truffle honey, which others on here seemed to have loved. Instead, I found it a bit overpowering and too reliant on the honey flavor. As a result, this dish was just good, but it could have been great.<br><br>Next, we had the short rib ravioli. A very one-dimensional dish with no real flavor development. It was good (because how can ravioli be bad), but I expected more. I think some more flavor depth would have helped this rather uncreative dish.<br><br>Finally, we had the truffle mushroom pizza, which was probably my least favorite dish of the night. As with the coccoli, the dough was phenomenal. Whoever is behind the creation of that dough deserves some James Beard recognition. The rest of the pizza was a complete miss. The mushrooms were charred, which gave them a bitterness that did not mesh with the rest of the pizza. Also, the garlic flavor stole the show and completely overpowered the other flavors that were trying to come out. An unfortunate end to the meal.<br><br>Part of the blame might fall on us, as we did not order the gnocchi that is so highly regarded on here.

The waiter recommended it, and then when I told him I didn't like the chianti, he said, yeah, it's not good, try the more expensive one. Why not tell me that in the first place, or better yet, just select good wines.  Speaking of vinegar, the oysters had a stong vinegar sauce on them so you can't taste the ocean, just the vinegar.

For the second course, I was also a bit doubtful about ordering the gnocci, because it was the only dish without a lot of meat! I was thinking, hey, if you're gonna spend $44 no matter what, you should probably get some kind of meat right? Well, actually, no. The gnocci has this amazing truffle cream sauce and just like the coccoli, it is AMAZINGNESS in your mouth. I couldn't stop eating. It was just too good.

Wagyu beef meatball sounds fancy but in reality taste like a good spiced Meatball melting in your mouth.

It has a refreshing lemon flavor similar to limoncello and packed with just enough punch of herbs.(very easy to take down) We tried the smoked mozzarella...this was probably one of the best things I have ever eaten. Creamy smoked cheese served with candied walnuts,  grilled escarole  and just the right amount of honeycomb - it delivered in everyway. However the star of the night for me was the gnocchi dish- talk about light and airy -these delectable pillows of goodness are to die for.  This was the second recommendation from our server - Stephanie is batting 1000. I recommend this place to anyone who loves great Italian food with pizazz , creative and tasty cocktails, excellent service but you better leave room for the dessert - bombolini are one of the best filling pastries you will ever have and the best part is you fill them yourself with three different choices.

It's funny that this seems to be a common theme in most of these reviews. TAKE A HINT.  Even my boyfriend, who appreciates salt more than I do had trouble eating it; however, finished it because he was so hungry due to our late reservation.<br><br>Parmesan Sage Fries: They were just OK.  It's hard to like anything else after you have tried the fries with aioli at Au Cheval; oh my goodness I'm salivating just thinking about it! Anything in comparison is just, meh.  The aioli at this restaurant tasted like ranch dressing.  They also brought out the fries immediately after the Burrata as an appetizer when we specifically asked for them to be brought as a side with our meal.  Mistiming and misplacement-ordering seems to be another theme in these reviews.  TAKE ANOTHER HINT.  In all fairness, the server noticed this after-the-fact and apologized for the mistake.<br><br>Gemmeli (I'm not sure what it's called, but, it's a fusili pasta dish with duck and some pitiful sauce).  The pasta was cooked well, but the duck was so gummy.  And they must have run out of salt after making the Burrata because the sauce was incredibly bland.  I absolutely love pasta, but this was terribly disappointing!!!<br><br>Mediterranean Seafood Brodetto: My boyfriend had this dish; it satisfied him, but it wasn't anything he was raving about.  His quote, \"I've had better.\" <br><br>We heard great things about the donuts, but we opted to skip dessert because we were so frustrated we just wanted to LEAVE.<br><br>Service:<br>Based on what I had mentioned earlier in this review I'm not happy with managing staff, but I can't knock the server because she did her job.  She was the only positive aspect of the entire experience.  She was very attentive, offered suggestions/recommendations, and she spoke loud enough for us to hear her.  Unfortunately it's not enough to alter my perception of this \"restaurant\".<br><br>Ambiance:<br>I'm quite confused, am I eating at a restaurant? Or a bar? I felt like I was at a high end Moe's.  Don't get me wrong, big screen TVs, bars, and high tops are great when I am trying to watch a game Sunday afternoon, have a casual dinner, etc... but when choosing a supposedly high quality restaurant to spend a special occasion at, it was obnoxiously distracting.  I was looking for a nice, special evening with mind-blowing food.  If they wanted to offer both atmospheres then it should have been clearly separated, for example how Tavernita has Barcito.<br><br>So if you made it through my review, congrats! You can tell that I'm obviously pissed.  If you are looking for good food don't bother with this place, especially for a nice occasion.  It's overrated and underwhelming; you can get better Italian food at any number of other places in the city.  Fabio, why slap your name on this piece of garbage?

What are they trying to do here? Is this a high quality Italian restaurant... or a Moe's Cantina style bar? Why was I seated at  high-top table after making a reservation months in advance? Why was there top-40 music blaring over the speakers? I could barely hold a conversation with my girlfriend. They market this place as if it was a high quality Italian eatery, yet you step into what is essentially a bar scene. I would have been fine if that's what I was expecting, but don't mislead your patrons. This is a BAR scene... Not an \"Italian restaurant\" by ANY MEANS. Same owners as Bull & Bear and Public House- it all makes perfect sense to me now......<br><br>Food- Not very good, at all.... I'm a human dumpster and pretty much love everything I eat. I wanted to like this place SO BADLY since I live literally half a block away. Disappointing is probably the word to most accurately describe it. Started off with oysters which were actually pretty good (figures because it takes no prep- they just crack 'em open)... But it all went down-hill from there. Ordered a plate from the \"mozzarella bar\" section of the menu. Again, I wanted to like it so much. It LOOKED(!) really good on the plate and I was so excited to put a bite into my fat mouth... But man was I disappointed . Salty as all hell, bread was burned, and this jam that went a long with it was just so Bland. I honestly could have cried- how are you an \"Italian\" restaurant and mess up such a basic plate. There was a drizzle of balsamic vinegar which was good, but not enough to recover the salty, burned and bland mess they served us. <br><br>The girlfriend ordered this duck pasta. Again, LOOKED AWESOME. I put a bite in my mouth and thought my taste buds had disappeared. This was their highly touted HOMEMADE pasta? Seriously? The waitress even commented \"oh man, that's a great dish\" when she put the order in. Was this woman delusional? I'm not sure... <br><br>I ordered this seafood Brodetto dish- A seafood mixture in a spicy tomato broth. It was actually halfway decent (THANK GOD). I can't lie about that. But again, I'm a human garbage can and enjoy pretty much everything. I have ordered a similar dish at several other restaurants in the city and this was probably the worst of them all. Whatever, I can deal with it.<br><br>Lastly we had a order of sage fries with some sort of garlic aioli. It was OK, not the best by any means. But lets be Honest...  if you can't get French fries with aioli down, may God Bless your soul<br><br>Service- We had a great waitress! She was attentive, Loud (Cause this place is outrageously LOUD), and made some honest recommendations (although nothing ending up being great LOL). Regardless, she was nice and a did a good job. Can't knock her. She will have no problem finding a new gig once this place closes down before the end of the year (ZING!).<br><br>In closing-  I really wanted to like this place since I live a block away.

I really liked the flavor of the crust but it was a little thin for me. If you like really thin crust pizza though you'd dig it! I actually found the salad and cauliflower to be the real stars of the night, the caesar salad dressing really paired nicely with the kale and the cauliflower had a nice lemon flavor and was paired perfectly with some really flavorful peppers.

The four is based on the theory that out of every restaurant in the universe, is this venue a 5? Like perhaps the French Laundry in CA? No, but in it's category, it definitely is a 5.<br>If you want to eat here, you'd better plan ahead...way ahead.This is one happening place...by 5pm on Thursday, the bar is filled and a lot of dining tables are, too. In no time at all, it is standing room only and you have to raise your voice to be heard. <br>The atmosphere is trendy, but  not overwhelmingly so. We sat at a high top table near  the open oven. At first I was not happy with this, because sometimes at a high top, you have to scramble a bit to sit down(really up) and your feet dangle-so uncomfortable. They have mitigated this by having a foot rail for your feet on the upholstered side of the table, and the chairs have foot rails, too. It was fine. The kitchen is a beehive of activity - not an open kitchen except for the oven, but we could still see the activity through the doorway. Surprisingly,as it was so busy, somehow we did not feel rushed. We had a very pleasant server - just the right mix of attentiveness, humor and information. My husband was seated facing a wall of mirrors. Our daughter remarked that if she was ever at a business meeting, she would take the seat underneath the mirrors, because the mirrors would distract her colleague from the conversation, giving her the advantage.<br>The food, which was what we were there for....my gosh, really good. We tried different items and shared, so we could test the waters, so to speak. There was not one clunker in the bunch. The only thing I would change is that the toasted bread that came with the meatball could have been a little less toasted. <br>Surprisingly, the stand out dish at our table was the lasagna. Our daughter, in all the years I've made lasagna, always turns her nose up and rarely eats it. I think the only time she has ever eaten lasagna in a restaurant was in Italy, where she had to admit, it was tasty. Now, I'm slightly insulted that my lasagna didn't make the grade, but this was seriously good and interestingly flavored lasagna.<br>She dipped into Sienna Tavern's lasagna at least 3 more times...tiny bites bursting with flavor! She said that she didn't know what was in it, but clearly it is something highly addictive. By the way, I read another yelp review which said that the pasta was boxed....I don't know what that person had, but the pappardelle was most definitely not from a box...it is from scratch. <br>Are wide, shallow champagne glasses back in favor?! Because for our Prosecco, that's what they used. I smiled....I am digging out my monogrammed silver wedding toasting goblets that have not seen the light of day for decades, not even for anniversaries.  Everything old is new again?!<br>We had a fruit tart, which was delicious - piled high with strawberries, sweet blackberries, raspberries and blueberries - they did not skimp on the fruit....the tart crust itself was admirable, as was the custard....there was also a dollop of gelato? on the plate...very good.<br>What really makes a restaurant 5 star in my opinion, is whether or not I would go back. Yes, in a heartbeat.

I think it is another example of a new restaurant that starts strong with great food, and then doesn't care anymore. But people keep coming based on the reputation or word of mouth. Our first visit was for lunch and we had a fiasco trying to be seated at a decent table even though we were virtually the only ones in the restaurant when we arrived at 11:30. <br>This visit was for dinner and we were celebrating my husbands birthday. At 4:45 we entered a virtually empty restaurant. This was the latest time I could get on open table 2 weeks ahead. Very puzzling considering the restaurant remained only about a quarter full the entire time we were there. When we were escorted to the first table the host was told to lead us to, it was dirty. After getting seated at the booth next to the dirty one, we ordered a truffle mushroom pizza which we had enjoyed at our first visit. This time the topping covered about 2/3 of the crust with a good 3 inches of empty crust left. Plain old dough. Ugh. <br>We ordered the Tuscan kale Caesar salad  which was fine and 2 pastas: the gnocchi and the tagliatelle. Both were meh. No real flavor from either and our gnocchi was missing the fried sage.  <br>Then for dessert. I told them about the birthday when I confirmed the reservation and then told the manager when she came to our table when my husband was in the bathroom. She thanked me for letting her know. Great. We ordered the caramel cake also. When the  bus boy brought the cake  ( the servers here don't do a whole lot other than take the order) he was also holding a birthday gelato with a candle in it...except he didn't leave it our table when he left the cake. Huh?  Don't know where it went but it never ended up at our table. I complained to the manager. She apologized and offered to comp the cake, which. Y the way at $12 was a joke.  It really memorable at all. The gelato never came, even as an afterthought. The final straw came when after asking for a refill on coffee 4 times, I finally got it. The bus boy  brought it ( of course), served it, and then accidentally spilled the entire thing of cream all over my daughter and I.  There are simply too many restaurants in Chicago that not only care about the small details, but also serve great food. This restaurant does neither in my opinion.  I. Their defense, after the cream spilling incident the manager comped the entire check. Nice gesture but we won't be back. I wonder if our server was non existent because Top Chef Morimoto was in the booth next to us?  Maybe, but did they serve him all the good food for the night too?", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Went there for Sunday brunch and it was yummy - I had the mushroom pizza and it was really delicious.

We also had he Hamachi crudo (with crispy onions and jalapenos) which was light and super flavorful, and finally we split the prosciutto pear pizza which was out of this world (and a pretty large portion).  We ended the night with the pistachio gelato which was honestly the best gelato I have had in the city - so creamy and flavorful. <br><br>Our server wasn't the most attentive and even somewhat snobby, and the busboys were somewhat overzealous with clearing plates when we weren't finished, but the food was so good that I will definitely be back!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Possibly one of my new go-tos for apps and drinks.

The salad was shaved pieces of brussel sprouts with small pieces of almonds and very light and refreshing dressing. We also had the Kobe meatball, which was the best meatball I've ever eaten (I'm Italian, so I've eaten my fair share of meatballs). First of all this meatball was huge and was covered with shaved cheese and served with amazing sauce. The meatball was perfectly cooked and just wonderful. We also ordered the buffala mozzarella, which was so creamy and soft and delicious. It was served with an amazing sweet, smoky sauce. The best cheese I've eaten. <br>Then for our entrees we had the Carne pizza, and the short rib ravioli. First the pizza was probably a 14 inch and it was enough to feed 2-3 people comfortably. The meat on the pizza was spicy and plentiful. The cheese, the mozzarella which was amazing. <br>The short rib ravioli in a mushroom sauce was delicious.

The 3 inch bay leaf in my pasta was unappetizing and I could see it as soon as the plate was placed on the table. I was surprised that it left the kitchen that way. Cooking sauces 101 - remove the bay leaf before serving.   Had I actually eaten it my rating probably would have been a zero. It did give me the feeling though that I had to inspect my food. The gnocchi was gummy but the sauce had good flavor. The margharita  pizza was good but nothing special. My daughters wanted dessert so we all were going to share the tiramisu but my very first bite had a hair in it which I didn't notice until I gagged on it.

The donuts came soon after. However, our server didn't come back until after we were finished. Then she shows up asking if we wanted to order any starters. What?? We are here for brunch and besides, what do you think the bomboloni were? So we place our orders and she disappears again. Our dishes were dropped off by a food runner but our flatware was never replaced. So we're sitting there waiting for someone, anyone to come by the table. Plus, we had to ask for our coffees to be refilled each time. After our plates were cleared, she showed up again to drop off dessert menus and then disappeared again. When she came back, she didn't ask if we had decided on dessert, she just dropped off the check and walked away.

On to the harvest salad that had all kinds of goodies in it (apple, candied hazelnuts, pomegranate seeds) and a refreshing spiced apple vinaigrette. We then chose a pasta-the butternut squash tortellacci. There were five ravioli-like pieces of butternut squash pasta in a brown sugar buttery creamy sauce. This dish is rich and understandably served small, as I was content with my one piece. Finally, we ordered two pizzas. Wrong decision as we were stuffed and barely put a dent in either. We assumed these would be like flatbreads but they're very big and could easily feed two. We ordered one with all different meats on it and one with pear, arugala and garlic cream.

The waitress recommended a glass of pinot noir for me -- that was only OK. <br><br>Food: Oh, the food. Just delicious from start to finish. We started with the meatball (huge, moist, delicious, covered in ricotta and divine tomato sauce) -- wonderful. Also got the bone marrow -- the presentation is great, with two huge bones that you scrape out and put on toasted bread with a lovely fennel salad and mushrooms. Just heavenly. For dinner, we got the squid ink pasta with lobster ($$$, but they do not skimp on the lobster) and the afore-mentioned GNOCCHI! The squid ink pasta was divine -- cooked just perfectly, with a tomato-cream sauce and lovely chunks of lobster everywhere over the black pasta. The gnocchi was just divine -- I have never in my life tasted such soft, pillowy (that is really the only word to describe it) gnocchi and realize now that the reason that I probably was indifferent on gnocchi before was because it was never made like THIS! It is dressed in a cream based truffle sauce with bits of pancetta and fried sage. The entire meal was amazing, but I dream of that gnocchi even now! Finally, for dessert -- the tiramisu was inventively presented in a little tin pan with meringues on the side (along with a picture of a tree in cocoa -- or espresso? not sure, didn't taste it alone)  <br><br>Be warned that all this food is HEAVY and they give reasonable-sized portions -- go hungry! <br><br>Service: Initially, we sat for a bit before anyone approached us.

We then ordered the coccoli appetizer which was really good. The prosciutto was really tasty, there was enough for each to have 1 piece. A few of us then wanted to try the cheese board so we chose the gorgonzola and red rock to try. The cheese came on a large rock like tray with 5 cube of the red rock and a piece of gorgonzola the size of a half of slice of cheese. It was accompanied by 5 walnuts, a quarter size dollop of a honey sauce and a quarter sized dollop of a tomato jam.

We then ordered the faro pasta, gnocchi, and the orechiette. We also ordered the margherita pizza. The pizza was a very good size and was tasty....definitely the best priced item on the menu for the portion size. The pastas were all very good but again lacking on the portions. Normally after have 2 appetizers and then ordering pasta, to go bags are needed, not here. Everyone cleared there plates because the appetizers were so minimal. We also all ordered drinks which were very good. Lastly, on our open table reservation that it was our friends birthday and when it came time for dessert they brought nothing. The birthday girl ordered the $5 gelato and when it arrived the waitress had a candle in hand and said \"it's your birthday right\" she then lit the candle and stuck it in the dessert....not the way we really wanted that to happen for our friends special day. The restaurant also charged us for the $5 dessert...not very good customer service if you ask me.

She was not one of these aloof hipsters that many restaurants hire, but genuinely nice and interested in our experience and feedback. She recommended the coccoli, which was outstanding. I still think of it. The fresh, crispy dough with the prosciutto wrapped around stracchino cheese was a taste sensation. I shared the Burrata with my friend. While the burrata portion was large, and the quality amazingly fresh, it was featured with figs. When the figs arrived, they were a mere decoration on the plate. When a menu lists figs in August, it should not be pieces that look like part of a mise-en-place. There should be more fig. I had the fresh and tasty pasta in a jar, which sounded like a gimmick, but was really good. My friend had lasagna in the cutest little metal baker. The tippy top of the meal was the bombolini. Wow, another fried dough extravaganza. We started with the coccoli, with fried dough, and ended with bombolini. A tasty meal and a great experience. When my friend recommended Siena Tavern, I hadn't heard of it, so I looked up their website and saw their wonderful video.
