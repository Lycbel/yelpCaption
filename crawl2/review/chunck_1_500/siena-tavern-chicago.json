We had the waitress tell us about her suggestions and the most popular items, but that just made it even harder to decide!! I ordered the scallops and my friends got the squid ink linguine, spaghetti, and brick chicken diavolo. We also got the cocoli as an appetizer. <br><br>I got a taste of all three my friends got. I'd say my favorite out the three was the chicken. It seems basic, but the chicken was just perfect - so juicy, moist, tender, and flavorful. The linguine came with lobster and the spaghetti with crab - both absolutely delicious. With all that being said, the scallops were perfection. The bottom of the plate was smothered in what I believe to be squash puree, topped with the scallops and cauliflower. The scallops were large and seared just right. To be the cauliflower were a tad bland and could have used a touch more of flavor. <br><br>Service 5/5<br>Our waitress was beyond patient - she checked in on us three times before we were ready to order, she went through the entire menu giving us one or two favorites from each section, and answered our many questions.

Plus the wine list is not your average - they seem to carefully select reasonably priced Italian Coastal wines that pair well with their main meals. <br><br>I will say when it comes to Italian food, I am extra fussy because I grew up on the real deal homemade from scratch Italian but Sienna Tavern has this Savory Holy Heaven 12oz (no, that's not a typo) Wagu Meatball ($19) that's worth all the indulgence! It's considered an appetizer but if not shared, it can easily become your only dish! Go ahead, you deserve it!! <br><br>Also while it's not a \"Chicago style pizza\" contender, it's a lovely light doughy crust with pretty much any topping you could desire and not too cheesy. Pretty much can't go wrong and the kitchen serves pizza til midnight y'all! <br><br>The bartenders and waitstaff are the epitome of Midwestern Hospitality and have clearly consumed if not all, definitely most of the menu so you can count on their recommendations if you are unsure.<br><br>Know that no matter when you go, it's likely to be buzzing with River North's young professionals and a smattering of tourists sent over by wise hotel concierges. Good chance you will have to wait a bit to be seated. Having said that, on a nice sunny day, brunch on the patio is super chill vibe but feels disconnected from the energy inside... however a seat at the bar near the pizza oven is actually my preference because it puts you in a great spot for watching all the scrumptious dishes being prepped to tease your tastebuds! <br><br>My reviews are all about the ENTIRE experience. Only downside is sitting at either bar (they have two) equates to thirsty patrons hovering over your food like vultures (I like my personal space bubble when I'm eating lol) and possibly stealing your bread baskets or taking an elbow as they attempt to hail down bar service! No joke! Scram kids. This is the 3rd time this has happened to me here.

I don't often travel with my dog but when I do I like to take him out and about with me. I called a head to make sure that their patio was open and informed them that I had my pooch with me. When I arrived there was some miscommunication between the hostess and the person who spoke on the phone with me but after waiting a few minutes they were able to set a table for me and asked if I was interested in their doggie menu for my pooch. We opted for the skirt steak for the little one. It was simply grilled with olive oil.<br><br>I opted for their Margherita Pizza which had a great sauce, which had the right balance of sweetness. The crust was flavourful, chewy but crispy on the outside just the way I like it. The cheese wasn't too over powering. It was a great pizza but nothing mind blowing. <br>My husband opted for their lobster roll. This was the cold roll variation with citrus poached lobster lightly tossed with an herb mayo. This was a light dish perfect for a light lunch. The citrus poached lobster gives it a light vibrant feel to its traditional heavily drenched mayo cold lobster roll. The plus was the accompaniment of Parmesan fries, they were delicious. I also had their beet juice to quench my thirst, nothing really special to this just a simple ordinary glass of beer juice. <br><br>I will definitely have to give this restaurant another visit without the pooch and try out everything else on their lunch, dinner and BRUNCH menu!

First of all, our party of 6 was squeezed into a booth that could have seated 4 people comfortably. Hubby said he felt like he was sitting in the middle seat on a plane. We asked if we could be seated at a table, but, the table we pointed to was reserved for another group. <br><br>In addition to the cramped seating conditions, we were subjected to blinding lights from the garage across the street. Although this is not Siena's fault, Siena should install shades for the comfort of their customers. <br><br>Despite the tight seating arrangements and the inconvenience of getting up every time someone had to use the bathroom, the food was pretty good.

Definitely somewhere I'd come to the bar just for drinks. <br>Between my friend and I, we shared an appetizer, salad, and pasta which was plenty for both of us. The Coccoli was way better than we were expecting and the brussel sprout salad was delightful. Now for the gnocchi; all the pastas here are handmade at 5 in the morning! How crazy is that? The gnocchi had a bit of bacon in it which gave it a smoky kick that will make your taste buds craving this combination when all your food is gone.

The freshness of the cherry tomatoes and artichokes in the omelet blew us away, and the potatoes it came with were to die for. The potatoes were garnished with lots of fresh Parmesan.

It was divine, but only when shmeared with a ton of the cream that came on the side with it. The French toast itself didn't taste like it had been soaked in espresso, as they claimed.

The Sangria was really tasty, not too sweet but sweet enough. <br><br>Favorite dishes: The Coccoli appetizer - recommended by our server and so thankful she did. The dough was crisp yet had some nice chew, the cheese was stretchy, prosciutto salty good, and the truffle honey added just a hint of sweetness to the party in my mouth. Highly recommend. <br><br>Bombolini Dessert - I'm not a big dessert guy but these Bombolinis are f&ckin awesome. It's basically a light and fluffy donut. The interesting thing is that it's potato based. You have your choice of filling as well which you inject yourself via squeeze bottles into the bombolini or on top or on the side or directly into your mouth or wherever the heck you want.<br> <br>Meh dishes: We got the Squid Ink Linguine and Spaghetti.

The cinque formaggi pizza and the margarita are also good but the prosciutto pear really wins when it comes to pizza here!<br><br>Pastas: Hands down my all time favorite pasta in the city has to be their perfectly executed pappardelle pasta! I never imagined something so simple could taste so amazing. The best gnocchi I've ever had is also at this restaurant and I can't get enough of the addition of the pancetta. Their orecchiette pasta was also good but I'd rather order something from the items above over this. <br><br>Dessert: The famous bomboloni! It comes in a group of four bombos with three different sauce/custard flavors. I really enjoyed these more than the ones at Bombobar/Bar Siena as they are smaller and came nice and hot. Their gelatos are also good, with a large selection of flavors. I love monkey bread and was happy to see that they have a delicious one here. I liked their caramel cookie jar was tasty but i'm not a huge caramel fan so it is just based on preference.<br><br>Drinks: I have loved every single drink I have ever ordered here but my absolute favorite is their No. 29 Â (belvedere, prosecco, grapefruit, lemon, mint, strawberry).

This place was great all-around! <br><br>Made a reservation for a busy Friday night, and got seated right away. It's a very lively environment when it's hopping; the dining area is not a bad size, but the bar occupies about half the space...not a bad thing! It's a nice bar. :) <br><br>Service was fantastic. This was my first time, so the our waitress gave me a tour of the menu, and she made some great recommendations on drinks. She was clearly very knowledgeable of the menu. She was also very attentive throughout the meal without bothering us in any way. The courses were well-timed, and everything came out quickly. <br><br>Ordered the #33 on the cocktail menu; it's their take an old fashioned. It was good! It boasts a gingerbread simple syrup and apple cider in addition to the bitters. It was a bit sweet for my liking, but all around a very smooth and balanced drink. (I had two of them, so I can't complain. )<br><br>Food was great! Better than I expected. Their claim to fame is that everything is made from scratch; it tastes homemade, but they're beautifully refined dishes! We started with the grilled octopus, which was nicely cooked for the most part. Some of the pieces were a little over-cooked, but they had a nice char. The sauce it came in was very light and tart...good contrast to the octopus.<br><br>For my main course, I had the short rib ravioli. Wow, really really good! Pasta was beautifully-cooked, and wasn't overdone. The short rib filling was a decent portion, and had a very nice flavor. The mushroom sauce was very rich, and it also had a hearty taste, and a little sweetness to it. All in all, I really enjoyed it; my only issue was that there was a bit too much of the sauce. It drowned the flavor of the ravioli a bit. Otherwise, really great dish! My dinner companion has the gnocchi, which she really enjoyed. <br><br>For dessert, we had a bit of an eyes bigger than our stomachs complex, that being said, I regret nothing! We ordered the bomboloni, which were delicious, and a pretty sizable order (4)! Comparable to a State fair donut--but better. They came with three really good sauces (raspberry, hazelnut and caramel for dipping). We also split a gelato flight (donuts and ice cream for dessert! Weeee!) the gelato was excellent!! My favorite by far was the brown butter peanut. Really rich, and it had chopped peanuts in it. Ordered cookies and cream, salted caramel and creme brÃ»lÃ©e. All very good, but the peanut is a must! <br><br>All in all, great experience! Would have been 5 stars if not for the wee missteps with the ravioli being over-sauced. They're quite pricey, too! Pasta starts around $19 a dish, and meat entrees started at $30, but averaged about $45.<br><br>I would definitely come back, but this is more of a special occasion place.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Liked this place...if it weren't so expensive for what you get I'd visit much more often.

The bar is a beautiful large oval with seats all around...many face outward looking through large plate-glass windows giving a gorgeous view. The room also has high tables around the edges so the bar area holds a lot of people. Nice venue to meet and greet. The liquor was the usual...the mixed drinks sounded pretty creative. My $$$ comment earlier referred to a $15 Johnnie Walker Black on the rocks...two drinks and you bought the bottle at home. The Margarita was too tart, the Bloody Mary was very nice, and the Disaronno Sour was perfect. Three drinks (we returned the Margarita) and a glass of wine for dinner with bar tip brought us to $75...so this is where they make their money.<br><br>In the dining room we had: the Gnocchi (5 stars for the pasta as it was creamy and puffy, but the rating gets knocked down to 4 because the included fried sage was not a good addition and there just wasn't enough of the wonderful pancetta), the Carne Pizza (5 stars and really the best of show...with all the meat on top the crust sagged a bit but that was Â expected), the Tagliatelle (3-4 stars and very nice but some of the mushrooms were too crunchy). For dessert: the Chocolate Cake (4 star good but a small serving if you are sharing) and the Gelato (3 star good but unremarkable). <br><br>Service was on and off...in the bar it was on...attentive and ready to please; in the dining room it was off...more lackadaisical and inattentive.

We also ordered the grilled octopus in lemon and these puffs made with Choux pastry (think savory cream puff) served with burrata, prosciutto and a green chutney-style sauce. The meatball was super tender and tasty. The octopus was off the charts! If I could have eaten the whole app by myself, I would have...it was that good. The puffs were good, but nothing special. <br><br>I was traveling with a colleague who had allergies. They accommodated his diet, allowing him to create a custom pizza, which he seemed to enjoy. My other colleague ordered a lobster spaghetti. She liked it, but it must have been rich because she barely ate it. <br><br>I ordered the short rib ravioli. The meat filling was tasty, but the pasta could have used a little more time in the pan. The pasta had a doughy, chewy taste, so I ended up eating the stuffing.

It was huge! Â It was also really, really good. It came with these awesome coffee meringues. I could have just eaten a pile of them for dessert. <br><br>For drinks we ordered a red wine from Sardinia. What a great wine list. The wine was super and not horribly priced.

Some of the food was really good including the fried dough appetizer with the prosciutto and cheese and the gnocchi pasta entree. These were absolutely delicious and they were the only things that were worth their price point. We also ordered their short rib ravioli which I was very disappointed with. It seriously tasted like the chef dropped balsamic oil all over the raviolis. Balsamic was way too overpowering.

There weren't any other cases, so I think we likely had the stomach flu, which makes me feel much better about Siena Tavern. However, I feel badly that I was wrong about food poisoning--I made the judgement based on the best info I had at the time, but still, I hate giving a negative review for something that wasn't correct.<br><br>The manager I spoke with was very generous, offering to make things right for us with another visit to Siena and a refund for our meal. He explained that any time a customer reports an issue, he is made aware, and that there are procedures that are followed. I appreciated his transparency.

It makes all the difference.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Original review:<br><br>I gave Siena Tavern 2 stars only based on the food, otherwise it would have been 1 star. <br><br>My husband and I had a late lunch at Siena Tavern on January 4. After reading the stellar reviews, I was really excited to dine there. The food was amazing. The coccoli, gnocchi, and brick chicken were all delicious. However, this 2-star review is based on the service and highly suspected food poisoning.<br><br>From the beginning... At 3:00PM on a Thursday afternoon, Siena was not busy. However, it took a while for the hosts to get us seated. Then, our server (who was inattentive to the point that I wonder if she would rather work somewhere else) couldn't answer simple questions about drinks that were on their menu, and had our drinks out after our appetizer and pasta course were served. We specifically asked that the pasta come out with our entree, and she did not apologize when she saw that it had come out before. She always seemed to be in a hurry, even though the restaurant was less than 25% full.<br><br>Now, the food poisoning. I thought at first my husband had come down with the stomach bug that's been going around. However, when I suddenly became ill as well, it made me suspect food poisoning. We never get sick at the same time, and since we ate the exact same things at Siena (one of which was pork and another salad), we are 99% sure it was food poisoning.<br><br>This would all be slightly OK (things happen), if the service before and after our horrible sick day had been at least adequate. We have a 9-month-old at home, and wanted to know if we had food poisoning or a virus he might get so we could be extra vigilant with the Clorox wipes. I called Siena when we both became ill to find out if anyone else had reported food poisoning. It was apparently very loud in the restaurant, and the hosts hung up on me 3 times because they couldn't understand what I was asking. I had full service on my phone and was calling from a quiet room. Finally, I got someone who took the time to listen carefully, and she assured me that a manager would call me after the dinner rush.

Â Is it elevated fine dining... no but it's the type of great experience where you actually connect in a friendly way with the staff and enjoy some really well executed upscale food in a modern tavern environment.<br><br>For starters, the staff is excellent... both our brunch and dinner experiences had passionate servers who were not only knowledgeable about the menu but truly loved talking with people. Â We ended up just talking about other great places to try for other meals and they honestly felt so happy to hear that we felt they were executing better on similar dishes compared to the sister restaurants (bar siena). Â It was great to see the friendly competition come out and the smiles from knowing they did better.<br><br>For brunch we may have over did it but we ordered a lobster hash, shrimp and calimari salad, caramelized brussel sprouts with pancetta, and a caramelized waffle with nutella, chocolate, and maple syrup.<br><br>As weird as it sounds... the brussel sprouts and pancetta really was amazing. Â The pancetta pieces were plentiful and cooked to a crisp like bacon which added to the nice sweetness from the caramelized sprouts. Â Did it convert a sprouts hater... absolutely. Â The pancetta helps.. a lot.<br><br>The waffle is deserving of another nod. Â The great thing about this is that it's made from a yeasted dough instead of a gooey soft batter. Â So it crisps up more like an European waffle. Â Loved it!! It was the perfect sweet component to brunch.<br><br>The lobster hash was very tasty and had plenty of good lobster chunks that werent rubbery. Â The salad was good but not a stand out compared to the waffle or sprouts.<br><br>For dinner, we arrived early because my plane was departing early evening.

Â We were told they marinated the octopus overnight before grilling it to get the charring and crispiness on the outside. Â Honestly... it's incredibly flavourful and tender. Â I loved this dish... the smokiness from the grill wasn't overwhelming but just enough to compete with the sweet acidity of the balsamic. Â The crispy potato chips was just extra ... I could have eaten more of this. Â We tried the octopus at Bar Siena just days before... how did it stack. Â Siena Tavern definitely was the winner.<br><br>The hearts of palm salad was a bright beautiful salad... was it amazing. Â It was good but the visual colours made it the most exciting. Â I do love blood orange so I'm a bit bias. Â Definitely a good bright light flavourful salad for the hot summer days.<br><br>The sprouts proved to be a 2 time winner... baconny goodness from the pancetta and the crispy sweetened caramelized sprouts. Â So good!<br><br>The salmon was good ... was it the best we had in Chicago. Â Oddly enough ... no. Â The salmon was well cooked but compared to Bar Siena... it just wasn't as good. Â I did love Siena Tavern's take better though... I found the tamarind glaze, carrots, and lentils a better match to the salmon than Bar Siena. Â So it's a tie between the two restaurants.<br><br>For desserts, we had the gelato of the month, Peanut Butter & white chocolate and the crazy indulgent Caramel Cookie Jar. Â We had a lot of gelato here in Chiacago... Black dog is a favourite but Siena Tavern's gelato of the month is on par. Â The peanut butter flavour was really pronounced without being Jiify PB sweet. Â It was more on the savoury side but it had a good sweetness at the end from the white chocolate. Â Honestly... one of my favourite non traditional gelato flavours this year. Â The caramel cookie jar was over the top... freshly baked caramel cookies that were crispy edges and softer interior and you could dip them into the nutella mousse... did I go into a sugar coma? Yes... was it worth it? Oh yes!<br><br>Overall, great restaurant to go for brunch and dinners. Â Service is warm and inviting while the food is just as good.

My friend ordered the Carbonara in a jar- gemelli, crispy pancetta, parmesan cream, spinach, egg yolk, pecorino. She ordered it without the Pancetta and the server said instead they'll add peas. <br>We got our Coccoli order fairly quickly and we just devoured those. The dough was crispy on the outside and soft inside. So, good. Prosciutto would've really made it even tastier but it was still great without it.

I mean it's pasta. <br>When we finally got the food it was very underwhelming. My Orecchiette was undercooked. They Â might have been going for al dente but it was a bit too undercooked for my taste. The flavors didn't wow me either. My friend's pasta was even more undercooked than mine. The peas were almost crunchy. At least mine was somewhat edible.

Â Mainly, I live in the 'burbs. Â I also worked in the Loop and don't Â  get out to River North often. Â My fiancÃ© and I prefer to visit neighborhoods further north when we go to the city since we don't like to pay an arm and a leg for parking.<br><br>However, a new job brought me to Siena Tavern as part of a welcome to the firm lunch. Â The restaurant is about a 3-minute walk from my new digs. Â I was super excited, especially given the raves reviews I'd seen posted about the place.<br><br>Our reservations were for 12:15 on a Friday afternoon. Â The place was rather busy with the lunch rush and the patio was full with diners enjoying the warm weather. Â We waited for a few minutes while our table was being prepared. Â We sat in a booth in the raised section of the dining room. Â The booth was relatively comfortable, but I didn't quite like how close the table was to me. Â I couldn't cross my legs comfortably at the table and had to keep my feet flat on the floor as not to hit the legs of the person seated in front of me. Â Eventually, I became accustomed to the somewhat awkward seating, but definitely would have preferred to eat at a regular table.<br><br>We started lunch with the coccoli. Â Our server described it as a deconstructed ham and cheese sandwich. Â You cannot go wrong with ham and cheese! Â The coccoli is made up of crispy dough, stracchino cheese, prosciutto di parma and truffle honey. Â Four pieces will set you back $17. Â Our server was kind enough to include an extra piece so that each person in our party could have their own piece.<br><br>Definitely get the coccoli if you go! Â The dough is light and fluffy. Â The cheese is creamy and the prosciutto adds the saltiness to the coccoli. Â The truffle honey adds a nice sweetness. Â I could have been satisfied eating that for lunch.<br><br>For my entree, I ordered the truffle mushroom pizza, which is topped with roasted wild mushrooms, garlic cream, mozzarella and white truffle oil. Â I'm a mushroom lover and prefer white pizza to red pizza, so this hit the spot! Â At $19, the pizza was *huge* - about 8 slices and definitely can be shared by more people. Â I ate two slices, took the rest home and ate them for dinner later that night. Â The pizza tasted great cold. Â However, I wasn't a big fan of the crust, which was a bit dry and bland. Â It would have been nice if I had some sort of a sauce to dip it in. Â But, overall, an excellent pizza and I'd definitely order it again.<br><br>Service wise, our server was friendly and efficient. Â The busboys were also friendly - refilling our water glasses whenever they looked low and offering us boxes and bags for our leftovers. Â A woman brought out a clean set of silverware for us to use for our entrees after we ate our appetizers, which was nice.<br><br>Overall, I'm impressed with Siena Tavern and am looking forward to going back to try the rest of their menu options. Â I've heard wonderful things about their pasta dishes (a co-worker ordered the carbonara, which was served in a jar that the server shook before putting it onto her plate). Â The brunch offerings look delicious as well. Â While River North is somewhat of a trek for me coming from the 'burbs, Siena Tavern is easily accessible with plenty of public transportation options to get to it, so that's not really a good excuse as to why I cannot visit it again. Â And, since it's so close to my work, I can definitely see myself having lunch there again.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ii6wRXSVrSC1No-TNoxLtg/348s.jpg", "caption": "Truffle mushroom pizza - delish!"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Siena Tavern has one of the best outside dining areas in River North.

She was very knowledgable and helped validate the food and drink choices that we made. <br><br>For drinks, my husbands friend and I had the number 30 cocktail, and my husband had the Siena draught. The number 30 cocktail was a tequila-grapefruit-mango drink, and delicious in the way you could drink it like juice and never realize you finished your drink so fast (until the tequila hits). It wasn't necessarily weak in alcohol, but it really disguised the alcohol flavor, so if thats what you like you will like this one.

The bar room was hedged by large windows on two sides lined with tall tables. The bar dominated the middle of the room and had stools all around. Katie was my bar tender and she won me over with her friendly personality and keen recommendations. It's because of her that I passed on a table and chose to remain at the bar once my friend arrived.<br><br>I started my midday meal with the No. 22 cocktail. Although Katie explained that Siena Tavern is well-known for their wine list (and it certainly was impressive) she pointed out the carefully formulated cocktails. They ALL appealed to me. I was intrigued that they had violet bitters, lavender, honey, sage or basil incorporated into every concoction. Katie selected the No. 22 for me. The ginger and lime were bright but the Johnny Walker Black made it mature and interesting. Finally, the Kriek Lambic contibuted a hint of innocent sweetness.<br><br>I eagerly chose the Restaurant Week menu. First I ordered the beet salad which is not quite as the menu described. The menu indicates that the beets are glazed. They just may be; however, they were not glazed in a way that was recognizable to me. They seemed to be covered in a creamy dressing. Also, the menu fails to mention that the beet salad is served with arugula. I LOVE the fresh, spicy, peppery taste of arugula; however, I quickly discovered that my friend hates the stuff. He would have been displeased with that surprise so I thought I'd mention it here.<br><br>I selected the Butternut Squash Tortellacci. Tortellacci are like the giant version of baby tortellini. As described, these were stuffed with butternut squash. It was very sweet and almost dessert-like. The pasta and the browned butter sauce with bits of fried sage helped to temper it a little but I suspect that it only made it more rich than it already was. I was happy to be introduced to this dish; however, I think that it makes for a confusing entree.<br><br>Lastly, I had tiramisu gelato. It had large pieces of cake-like lady fingers mingled with the coffee, maple-y flavor of the creamy gelato.

Our entrees were ready and served while we were only midway through our appetizers. Katie confessed that the kitchen sometimes times dishes like that.

My 1st course was the butternut squash soup with truffled chestnut gremolata. The soup was superb! The gremolata reminded me of a pesto and added a nice flavor to the soup. Others in my party ordered the two different salads and the chopped salad looked great. My 2nd course was the grilled chicken sandwich topped with crispy pancetta bacon, smoked mozzarella, argula, sliced tomato, and piquillo pepper aioli all on a brioche bun. The grilled chicken sandwich was good but not my favorite. Standard fries accompanied the sandwich. I did try some of the tavern burger and preferred it over the grilled chicken. The burger was a bit greasy but it was fantastic. I especially enjoyed the crispy kale that sits under the burger. I also tried a slice of the burnt pepperoni pizza and boy oh boy was it delicious. It seemed like pizzas are quite popular as I watched pizza after pizza slide into the huge oven. Pizza here is neapolitan style and the dough is great! Soft, chewy and holds up well to toppings. Dessert was a choice of gelato. I tried the flavor of the day, if I remember correctly was a raspberry with chocolate cheesecake chunks and bacardi infused somehow.

But frankly, having had better Italian food, didn't wanna dilute the standards by rating high just because of that one aspect. So I went here with my husband for his birthday, they were extremely graceful about the occasion, gave one of the best seating and wished him. We are vegetarians, so another reason this place has a high rating could have something to do with their meat dishes. Anyway we started off with a watermelon salad with 2 kinds of aioli, this was he only dish my husband described as heavenly; for myself, there was a tinge of parsley taste coming so not something I favored. The burrata was one of the worst I've had, because they decided to layer it off with a smoky sweet tomato jam which killed its taste. The roasted cauliflower was again average. In the main course the pasta with leek(forgot the name) which is also supposed to have shrimps (removed for us as we are vegetarians) was highly recommended, so we ordered it and frankly hated it; couldn't eat a bite. But the management was nice enough to enthusiastically take it off our bill(again great customer service). The pizzas were interesting, not so much the best. We had a half-half of truffle mushroom and some vegetarian pizza. They brought a birthday gelato with candle lighted and all for my husband, which gave us a special feeling. Overall I was still going to give this place a rating of 4, but the desserts just disappointed us. We had their most popular chocolate gelato cake and another item which was like frozen pistachio; the pistachio item was just interesting but I would never wanna eat it again; the chocolate gelato cake was too sweet, reasonably good but way too sweet. We did not try any drinks beside cappuccino and espresso which were well made; being a tavern drinks must be one of their specialties resulting in their high rating as well. Just going by the items we had, great experience in terms of the friendliness and special feeling, but I've certainly had way better Italian food.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I'm a proud supporter of Team Fabio, and coming here was on my bucket list.

The fried dough balls are very large, I would say sandwich-sized as opposed to appetizer-sized, and tasted of old oil that had gone off. Inedible in my opinion. I told our waiter and he instructed me on how to eat them. I don't think I was doing it wrong. The butternut squash soup was delicious as was the Harvest salad. Our cocktails also were lovely. My Pappardelle noodles were house made and delicate, but the bolognese, which I was told is a signature dish, contained lamb.

Typically, I do my own restaurant research (shocker), but this time, I felt it best to leave it in the locals' hands. Without hesitation, their response was Siena Tavern, even going so far as to call it their favorite. I'd never heard of it, and neither had any of my colleagues in New York (for whatever reason, they were very interested in where we were going to eat). No matter - I was at the mercy of the Windy Citizens now.<br><br>The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the uber-trendy decor - part Crate and Barrel catalog, part reality show date location. The second was the sheer size of the place, space for days with a private party going on in the back complete with its own bar. Our waitress was immediately the epitome of Midwestern charm - smiley, bubbly, super attentive, and ultimately a ninja, popping up unexpectedly and often throughout our meal.<br><br>When we placed an otherwise strong order to split as a table, I internally scoffed at the Heirloom Carrot Salad pick from one of our more health-conscious co-workers. To say the dish took me completely by surprise is an understatement. I don't love carrots, and with such a meat-centric menu, I pretty much planned on glossing over the salad section. But this - the titular veggies tossed with broccolini, shaved squash, goat cheese, Marcona almonds, and Cabernet vinaigrette - was fantastic. I scarfed this salad down and can confidently say it was my favorite thing I sampled at Siena Tavern.<br><br>I had my eyes on the Wagyu Beef Meatball since first visiting the website and I was treated to a huge and deliciously blended sphere of meat, covered in roasted tomato sauce and topped with ricotta and basil. I was happy to see our Carne Pizza, a quattro-hog topping experience (housemade fennel sausage, pancetta cured bacon, sopressata, and prosciutto sausage), served as thin crust and none of that deep-dish nonsense. The Squid Ink Linguini had a lot of promise, containing both a grilled lobster tail and spicy lobster cream sauce, but it was served lukewarm and the temperature may have hurt the dish for me. Hey, I'll take three out of four any day, so no harm, no foul here.<br><br>The clientele while I was in town was unsurprisingly a very business lunch crowd, and I see how Siena Tavern appeals to Chicago yuppies come happy hour or weekend brunch. This also explains why my fellow New Yorkers were unfamiliar with the place, perhaps appearing outside of tourist must-do lists and under strict local jurisdiction. Take the insider tip I was given and check out Siena Tavern when looking to get off the prescribed out-of-towner path, and live like a local, even if it's just for a lunch.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Went to Siena Tavern for Sunday brunch.

Sometimes I partake. <br><br>... okay, okay. I guess I always partake... because somehow food just tastes better when your boss (or anyone but yourself) buys it. And because team building... yeah, that's the reason. Team building. Totally because of the team building. <br><br>So anyway, I mention the work lunch because that's how I became familiar with Siena Tavern, a place that apparently everyone else who's even one iota of hip has been to, heard of, or has on their list of 'must try' places. <br><br>I, on the other hand, had never heard of it (probably because it had three dollar $$$igns tagged on to it), nor did I understand why people were telling me to say hi to some Fabio character when I checked in, and to be completely honest, the way they spell Siena offends me in a way I can't explain... or at least can't explain well. I realize it's named after Siena, Italy, but that spelling makes me feel oddly uncomfortable... like when a person cuts a non-pie shaped piece from a pie and it makes you want to simultaneously fix the shape of the cut and knock out the person who took such a hap-hazard non-slice. moving on...<br><br>Danny W picked Siena Tavern. A place he'd previously raved about but that I absolutely never would've gone to outside of this lunch since I'm not a big fan of Italian food and because of the aforementioned $$$ price category... but I had to respect the guy (a little, at least) for having the balls to pick such a pricey place for a work lunch knowing we wouldn't have to fit the bill... not that I didn't pick a crazy expensive place when it was my work lunch pick (Medieval Times!), but I consider that to be different since my pick was both lunch AND a world-class show, and we were celebrating two team member birthdays, and also because I'm last on the lunch rotation and so far every Candice-picks-lunch day has either been canceled, or no one comes, so I felt like I got to save up red-headed-co-worker points and pull the lunch trump card when my day finally did arrive. Â <br><br>So we've got a reservation for 6 and they give us this big-ass booth near a semi-private room and just across from the side bar. The place was definitely bumpin' at 12:30 in the afternoon, but the staff were on their A-Game and the atmosphere, while I imagine is probably much swankier at night, worked for a nice lunch spot as well... not too casual, but perfect for our purpose of a work lunch, and even better- they have an adjusted lunch menu with fewer items than dinner, but they're also priced much friendlier to the average person than an evening feast at Siena would have been. Lunch is somewhere between semi-budget friendly and semi-splurge-y, depending on who's footing the bill, of course.<br><br>My group started off with the Coccoli since the server was hyping it up as if she were Moses and the tablets read, 'though shall get the Coccoli'. When it came it wasn't exactly what I was expecting, and while I'll admit that I only had a bite, I thought it was just alright. Didn't really see what all the fuss was about. <br><br>Since my usual routine involves a coffee (with about half flavored creamer) at 10:30am and then lunch around 3:30/4 and our work lunch times usually center around 'normal' eating hours, I really only wanted something light so I could say that I did, in fact, eat here, so I went with the Farro Salad (grilled herb-marinated shrimp & calamari, green bean, roasted peppers, celery, basil, herb mustard vinaigrette). It tasted a lot more vinegar-y than I was expecting and had an odd dairy tinge to it that made my stomach turn a little - but in all fairness, I think this dish would be something a person who likes coleslaw would really love, because that's what it was most similar to in my eyes. A really nice, fancy coleslaw... unfortunately I don't dig coleslaw--at all, but I still managed to scarf most of my dish down for the sake of the shrimp and calamari that gave their little lives for it. <br><br>What I was sad I didn't get: The Squid Ink Linguini and the Lobster Roll with giant heaping chunks of lobster. I didn't get them because they were both upwards of $20 and as a person who frequents the Ramen aisle at Meijer, I didn't quite feel comfortable putting what seemed like such an extravagant lunch-time dish on the company dime... Luckily, Danny W didn't feel the same way and ordered up that $28 lobster roll and I'm only a little ashamed to admit I watched every bite as he devoured it. It looked... like heaven. It was stuffed to the brim and even Danny, who's quite the glutton, couldn't finish the last few bits of lobster that fell from him sammie. So when he wasn't looking I happily swooped in with my grabby fingers and plucked a few fallen pieces (along with some fries) from his plate. <br><br>I left with major regrets about not ordering that lobster roll but vowed to save up my pennies and come back on my own one day to do that damn lobster roll all on my own. All 28-totally-worth-it dollars of lobster roll.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HmxqI2idm1MrngzZFo8QEQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "Cocktails & bubbles menu"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/g0Rq56xlcLFCt2gjgDuW5A/168s.jpg", "caption": "Storefront"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/40vsJeRlhH-RoiiVRivjZg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Tavern Burger"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!<br><br>I've been here 3 times- most recently for my birthday dinner.

I didn't mind this as it was an excuse to try one of their numbered cocktails before diving into wine. I opted for the number 8(?) -- the one with tequila. It was Awesome! My sister opted for just water and \"a sip\" of whatever I was getting. The sip quickly turned into a gulp than a guzzle before I ripped it out of her hand and reminded her that it's a $15 drink and to slow the F down. So after about 30 minutes I receive no text so I check in with the hostess who tells me that the couple at our soon-to-be table is staring longingly into each other's eyes and sipping on the rest of their wine and there's not much she can do.

To start, definitely order the coccoli. I'm serious, there's no question here, just order it. The coccoli is nice and crispy on the outside and so soft and airy on the inside. There's a glaze of truffle honey, which is indescribable, it's so good. It's also served with prosciutto and stracchino cheese, which is almost an embarrassment of riches at this point. Chef Fabio, you've really put something truly remarkable together here! Â We also ordered the bone marrow, which we knew we wanted as soon as we saw it on the menu. Don't be frightened, the bone marrow is remarkably soft and is perfect as a spread on the crispy bread it's served with. <br><br>For our entrees, we got the squid ink linguini and the short rib ravioli. Just like the coccoli, you have to order the squid ink linguini. Just do it. No questions asked. The fresh pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was aromatic and had a nice kick without being overwhelming. The lobster was just slightly overdone, but even that did little to take away from this amazing dish. The short rib ravioli was also very good. The texture and flavor was spot on. <br><br>We couldn't leave Siena Tavern without trying a pizza so we ordered the truffle mushroom pizza, which certainly did not leave us disappointed. Every component was amazing: the roasted mushrooms, the garlic cream mozzarella, and the drizzle of truffle oil.

However, at the same time, it somewhat reminded me of lunch meat, because of its tender texture. It would have been great if there was some crunch or hardier texture to it. The mozzarellas were fresh and splendid. The mushroom pizza was the best, as even my boyfriend who is not a fan of mushrooms enjoyed it.<br><br>I had the jar in a pasta. While it was indeed a cool presentation (as with everything else), being brought out literally in a jar and then shook up by our server, it again was not very memorable.

I would have given four stars, except a member of our group ordered the double cut pork chop, medium to medium rare, and it came out nearly well done.

We also ordered the Shaved Brussels sprouts. Not impressed with a pile of sprouts. I would have preferred a bit more char to mine. The Truffle Mushroom pizza was pretty good.

I was lucky enough that I got to try a bunch of different things because we had a large group and each was more delicious than the last! <br><br>A friend and I shared the coccoli and the bufala mozzarella for our appetizers. I have never experienced anything like the coccoli but it legitimately melted in my mouth. It was an amazing flavor combo, if you get it make sure you make use of the honey it's served with. Also worth nothing is the presentation, I loved how the app came on a giant wooden block, very fun. The bufala mozzarella was also outstanding. The sea salt, tomato jam and basil oil highlighted the cheese perfectly and the cheese so fresh. I also have to say I was really happy with the portion sizes of both appetizers. Both came with enough for four servings but could be split in half to have as many as eight servings.<br><br>For my meal I chose the proscuitto fig pizza.

I looked at the server and said, \"Who is catering this event?\" And she said, \"Siena Tavern!\" I said, \"That was delicious!\" She then told me that there was tons of food on the other side, after the tour through the Stuga! I must admit I have never tasted such flavor in a piece of catered food. The coccoli was a sweet puff pastry with sweet cheese like a ricotta and a slice of Procuitto on top with greens and a drizzle of something sweet. That is my guess on the ingredients because I didn't have a menu in front of me. I could hardly wait for my tour of the Stuga to finish, so I could sample more of this incredible food.<br><br>During the event the food kept coming and there was plenty of it. I loved how the servers were actual Siena Tavern employees which meant they knew the food they were serving. My second favorite thing of the night was the Kobe meatball. It was covered in a delicious red sauce, ricotta & fresh basil. These things just melted in my mouth. I learned that at lunch I could get a meatball sandwich or for dinner I could get a 12 ounce giant meatball as an appetizer. Can I get both? Yeah it was that good. Again this was delicious food was at an event. Â This never happens. <br><br>The most interesting item I tried was the cooked venison on a stick. I've never had deer and I've never had a desire to eat Bambi. But tonight I figured I would put Siena Tavern to the test. You want to know what? It was delicious. It was topped with two crispy potatoes. And those potatoes were still crispy. Again I've never had crispy potatoes at an event. I even grabbed the last one off the tray, so it should have been cold and soggy but it wasn't. <br><br>I also loved the roasted tiny red peppers that had yummy cheese and chorizo inside. Again I didn't have a menu, so I'm gonna call it yummy cheese. I would love to make something like this at home. <br><br>The gnocchi was so good. Â I'm not usually a fan but these housemade gnocchi were out is this world. Â I think I was really in love with the house made pancetta. It's like bacon but a hundred times better! Â They also were serving a small crostini with asparagus on top. It wasn't my favorite and because it wasn't easy to eat standing up with 500 people looking at me. I had a little taste but I didn't finish it. Â I had to dislike something because everything was so good. <br><br>The servers just kept coming with more and more food. As I was standing there, I noticed the Chef Kevin Abshire was standing there looking at the event floor. I leaned over to him and said, \"Best Catered food I ever had in my life!\" He got a big smile on his face and said, \"Thanks!\" We had a great talk about food. I even learned that they were also cooking food onsite in a tent outback. No wonder everything tasted amazing. I wish all caters cared this much when serving food to a crowd. After talking the Chefs ear off, he obviously hasn't read one of my long winded reviews, he had to get back to work. He even made sure to tell me to call him when I finally eat inside there location. <br><br>I thought the night of food was over and then they brought out hot donuts. Stop it! I had to grab one of these delicious bites. It was so good that I had to have another one. In fact, there were 3 different flavors. I highly recommend you order these. I was informed they are available at the restaurant.<br><br>If you are looking to impress your guests with amazing food, then I would highly recommend the Siena Tavern prepare the food you. These tasty bites are a show stopper and you will be the Party Planner of the Year, if you use them for your next event. .", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XcvDejF6BuPuZ7OCD9IWEA/348s.jpg", "caption": "A close up view of the squid ink linguine with grilled lobster tail.

Our server was super sweet and gave us some yummy recommendations and here is what we shared and loved:<br><br>Coccoli-Crispy dough, stracchino cheese, prosciutto di parma, truffle honey, so amazing the dough was super fluffy and the prosciutto just melts in your mouth, you get four pieces for $14 so it's definitely worth it, this is a unique and must try dish here.<br><br>The tavern burger- Because I just can't resist something with tomato jam, this burger has fontina cheese, tomato jam, baby arugula, crispy pancetta, herb aioli on a brioche bun for $16. It seems a little pricey but it is amazing, one of my favorite dishes here, and it's super big with fries so you can easily share this dish.<br><br>Truffle Mushroom Pizza- Roasted wild mushrooms, garlic cream, mozzarella, white truffle oil. How can you go to an Italian place and not try their pizza. It was good but not the best that I've ever had but for $18 it has like 8 pieces so you won't be left hungry, that's for sure. I would definitely try one of their pastas next time instead of the pizza since it was just so so but we were full beyond belief by this point after all the carbs.<br><br>Tiramisu- For $9, the dish was presented beautifully, one of the prettiest I've ever seen, like with a Sienna Tavern tree logo made out of cocoa, just beautiful.

Â He and I were definitely in agreement that Siena Tavern is probably our second favorite Italian restaurant that we've been to (US only..we haven't been out of the country yet). Â <br><br>We had a 5:30 reservation a couple Saturdays ago, but even as the night went on there were still a handful of tables still available. Â We were placed on a high top (but big table), I would have preferred a nicer lower \"normal\" table, but it was quite comfortable for me still since I got the plush booth seat. Â I loved our waiter Sam. Â He was so friendly, helpful and honest with us. Â Ladies, he's a cutie too! Â He and the rest of the waitstaff were very attentive as well. Â Sam explained that they use seasonal ingredients and pastas, mozzerella and chacuteries are even made fresh in house.<br><br>It was definitely a hard choice to pick what to order because everything sounded and looked amazing! Â We shared for our appetizer: coccoli. Â They also split into two servings for us: the short rib ravioli and the tagilatelle. Â And for dessert the bomboloni. <br><br>The coccoli was AMAZING! Â It's lightly fried dough paired with stracchino cheese, proscuitto and truffle honey. Â Everything was so fresh and well balanced. Â The truffle honey didn't overpower any flavors of the fried dough, creamy cheese or delicious proscuitto, it all complimented. Â After we finished this, I was tempted to order a second order for us or even a crudo item, but refrained to save room for dessert. Â As mentioned they split the pastas for us and even split the portions were very generous! Â  The short rib ravioli were plumply filled with tender short rib and roasted porcini mushrooms with taleggio cheese and all in a delicious light savory brown butter sauce. Â The tagliatelle were accompanied with chantrelle mushrooms, parmigiano and a intoxicating truffle butter sauce. Â It was a lighter pasta dish but still packed a whole lot of flavor. Â Both pastas were delicious and this noodle/pasta loving girl of course loved the freshness of their in house homemade pastas...I can't pick which one I liked more. We were getting a little stuffed but I so wanted one of their enticing desserts. Â We finally decided on the interactive bomboloni. Â Four Italian style donuts with little tubes for you to squeeze in the fillings - whiskey caramel, chocolate hazelnut, and raspberry chianti. Â Besides the gelato, this was one of the more lighter desserts they offered. Â I loved how \"interactive\" it was and they were tasty, abeit a teeny bit oily, but that's how those bombolonis are. Â We didn't taste the whiskey in the sauce, but I loved the raspberry and chocolate hazelnut sauces. Â  Â  Â  <br><br>We told Sam, who later got a manager for us, that we hope they open one in SF because they would make such a killing! Â They are opening soon in Miami and next in LA...hopefully SF will be in the works in the next 5 years. Â Loved the mod and dark tones of this beautiful, delicious, affordable top notch restaurant. Â If you want a break from the pizza and meat in Chicago, definitely head to Siena Tavern.

Â I liked Fabio on Top Chef, but now I am definitely rooting for him on the next show in which he competes. Â Yum.<br><br>We had the Coccoli, which are essentially savory cheese filled doughnuts - seriously, they were delicious and I could have eaten half a dozen. Â The Bufala Mozzarella was light and creamy - surprisingly refreshing. Â For mains it was Gnocchi (of course), squid ink pasta (which was truly excellent - salty and delicious), and Spaghetti with Crab and Lemon sauce which was outrageous. Â I love this dish because it is so light and yet bursting with flavors of freshness - lemon and the sea. Â But, in the final analysis the Gnocchi did live up to its billing - really great.<br><br>The cocktail list was not my style - too many drinks with fruit and training wheels.

Â Kale can be bitter and a bit \"rough\" in the mouth. Â Siena's kale salad is simply fantastic, outstanding, incredible!! I never knew kale could taste so good! Â They toss the salad in a very light but milky dressing, and the kale leaf lends itself to holding the right amount of dressing so the proportion of dressing to kale is perfect. Â Hat's off to the chef to figure out how to do this so well. Â The shrimp wasn't overcooked and seasoned wonderfully. Very nice. <br><br>The staff is truly fantastic at all hours of the day. They're warm, friendly, patient and helpful. Despite constantly being busy they never seem or act \"rushed\". The only exception is the snotty Asian man at the host/hostess station. Â He must have compromising pictures of the owner to keep a job there with his attitude. <br><br>Now, brunch is simply fantastic. Â They have one of the best menus in the city. Â First, they have a proper brunch menu (some restaurants just open for brunch with no special menu...por qua?). Â <br><br>Biscuits and Gravy: Â Didn't want to order it. I don't like feeling as if led ingots are setting in my stomach all afternoon. Â BUT I did order it, and it is marvelous! SO GOOD. Â  It's not heavy at all. Â It's light, tasty and not pasty, flaky pastry, marvelous portion....perfect and presentation is great.<br><br>Breakfast Sandwich: Simply awesome. Â My fave. Â Don't underestimate it. Â It's excellent. Â <br><br>Monkey bread: Â Soooo good. Served warm and fresh. Â <br><br>Tiramisu French Toast: Everyone is doing this type of thing, but they do it very, VERY well. <br><br>Eggs Benedict: everyone thinks they can do it well, most can't. They do it very well. The hollandaise has a nice \"tang\" to it from the lemon, it's fresh, creamy, and light (some hollandaise can be very pasty, this isn't). <br><br>Lastly, I recommend if you are a party of two or more, share the plates. Â Get some of the sweet pastry stuff, and then some of the other egg items and share with each other. Â It's the only way to do it!<br><br>Oh, great coffee, excellent orange juice and mimosas. Â  I hate bloody Mary's, so I can't judge theirs or anyone else's. Â <br><br>Nothing better than sitting on the patio for brunch on the weekends.

You make a little sandwich and it totally rocks. I've also really enjoyed the burrata, which comes with a tasty tomato jam and delicious grilled garlic bread. For pizza, I've tried both the burnt pepperoni and the truffle mushroom. I have to say, I really preferred the burnt pepperoni. It was incredibly flavorful, totally recommend. Pastas, the gnocchi is a very unique dish, but very rich, so I definitely recommend sharing this one. I also really enjoyed squid ink linguini and rigatoni with lamb sausage.

Â He said that I left siena that evening and followed a gentleman to his car, and that his other male friends made a complaint to management. Â He then continued to tell me that the management team and the owners decided that I was no longer welcome at Siena.

We had been waiting a while for a table, so we decided to order appetizers. The bartender recommended the grilled octopus and steak tartare, so naturally we ordered both.

Sure, I appreciate someone that knows his way around a kitchen but a celebrity chef has no bearing on whether or not I go to a restaurant; I just want good food. I can't believe how many people asked me if I saw Fabio what's-his-name when I dined at Siena Tavern. The truth? Even though he was one of the more likeable contestants on Top Chef, I didn't even look for him when I was here.<br><br>Everyone seems to be clamoring to eat here, so reservations, even at lunch, are hard to come by. We made ours a couple weeks in advance. I'm pretty sure they don't even take lunch reservations between 11:45 and 1:00 (pretty smart if you ask me; they get at least two seatings this way). When we arrived for our 1:00, crowds were out in full force.<br><br>I really liked the atmosphere and it definitely seems tailor-made for River North. We were promptly shown to our table and given the shpiel by the waiter: \"Everything's designed in the spirit of sharing.\" What a diplomatic way to proclaim that everything is served in small portions so you need to order a lot to feel satisfied.<br><br>We all know by now that this food trend of \"shared plates\" is here to stay. I have accepted this, even if I don't like it. If I didn't, I'd have many fewer options when dining out.<br><br>We ordered the burrata with tomato jam from the mozzarella bar, gnocchi, and crispy brick chicken with sticky parmesan potatoes. It was the perfect amount of food. The tomato jam was slightly sweet and beautifully offset the creamy burrata. The gnocchi simply melts in your mouth. I thought the combination of truffle, sage and pancetta was perfect. You could taste all three but none of these ingredients overwhelmed the others. The brick chicken was mostly boneless which made it easy to share, and we couldn't stop eating the potatoes that accompanied it. I also loved the garnishes of balsamic roasted garlic and grilled lemon. It was all delicious.<br><br>We were stuffed and didn't save room for dessert, so next time, we'll order more light dishes so we can try the bomboloni (donuts you inject with squeeze bottles of sauces). I could really have a good time with those squirt bottles.<br><br>The bar area looks like a fun place to have a cocktail after work (and I'm sure it's quite the scene) and my favorite part was the \"wall of herbs\" behind the bar. The herbs are freshly cut for cocktails and used in the food. It makes me want to go home and grow my own wall of herbs.<br><br>Service was good, except for a few overzealous bussers who tried multiple times to clear away our plates while we were still eating. Many times we were in the middle of conversation and pausing between bites but that didn't mean we were done eating. (As if we were going to leave any gnocchi uneaten!) We also had to ask for additional plates and serving utensils. I feel like these should have been brought automatically if the intent is sharing food.

We consulted Yelp for suggestions on what to order. We did a party-line ticket of all the favorites: Coccoli, Gnocchi, Meatball, Burrata, the burnt pepperoni pizza and the bomboloni donut dessert. <br><br>Everything was really wonderful and lived up to the hype. The Coccoli was really interesting in taste and texture. Slightly sweet, slightly savory, with a crumbly pastry, meat and cheese. The gnocchi was good, but tasted like gnocchi we'd had at other places. The meatball was outstanding in every possible way. I'd eat one of those every day if I could. The burnt pepperoni pizza was delicious, but pretty spicy with a lingering burn that later gave us both heartburn. The dessert donuts were really yummy and fun to eat with little bottle of dipping sauce to try in cinnamon, chocolate, caramel and raspberry jelly.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "As soon as I had my first bite of the Gnocchi with Truffle Cream and Crispy Pancetta at Chicago Restaurant Week's First Bites Bash, I knew a visit to Siena Tavern needed to be in my near future. Had I known when I took that bite that Siena Tavern was the new Italian restaurant of chef Fabio Viviani...well, let's just say there would have been some squeals involved. I'm a huge Top Chef fan and the charming Viviani of Season 5 won Fan Favorite for a reason. I had no doubt that my gnocchi was just a small taste of the amazing food Fabio had in store for Chicago.<br><br>Situated on the corner of Kinzie and Dearborn, Siena Tavern fits perfectly into Chicago's trendy River North neighborhood. Lucas Stoioff and David Rekhson of Bull & Bear and Public House are no strangers to this 'hood, and they know how to do it right.<br><br>Our reservation was at 6:30p on a Friday and we arrived early to grab a drink and check out the bar area before dinner. At 6p the place was seriously hoppin'...from business professionals grabbing a drink after work to girls dressed like they were ready to hit the club...it was quite the mix of people.<br><br>We were able to grab a spot at the bar and try a few of their Femme du Coupe cocktails. I tried the #2 and the #4. Both on the sweeter side, one made with vodka and the other with gin. I thoroughly enjoyed both, but the #4 with plymouth, lavender honey, lemon, and creme de violette was definitely my fav. By 6:30p the wait for walk-ins was almost 2 hours...if you don't have a reservation I'd suggest stalking the bar patrons and swoop in once they're ready to leave-like I said, we snagged a couple seats at the bar less than 10 minutes after arriving.<br><br>Once our reservation time rolled around we were seated at one of the half-circle booths in their large, open dining room. We had a group of 4 and the booth was perfect; we had more than enough room and the arrangement made for intimate conversation while letting us take in the beautiful space around us.<br><br>The service we experienced was outstanding-our server Karissa was so friendly and had great suggestions, she coursed our dishes perfectly, and our water glasses were never empty. The plates at Siena are smaller and made for sharing. I think a group of 4 is the perfect size if you're looking to maximize the number of dishes you can try while still getting a decent portion of each.<br><br>We started with a few smaller plates: Â the Burrata from their Mozzarella Bar, served with a delicious tomato jam and grilled bread; the Saba Roasted Bone Marrow with pickled maitake mushrooms and crispy bread; and the Siena Chopped Salad. The salad was good but the Burrata and Bone Marrow were major standouts. I will definitely be ordering both of these again when we return (because we'll obviously be returning).<br><br>We followed up our \"starters\" with a few pastas. We tried the Short Rib Ravioli, Squid Ink Linguini, and Gnocchi. Again, they were all incredibly delicious and picking a favorite is nearly impossible, but I think the linguini stood out the most for me. The rich, meaty ravioli and velvety truffle cream gnocchi were both dishes I would absolutely order again. However, the subtle spice of the lobster cream sauce on the linguine was what really did it for me. Plus, I think I just love eating squid ink linguini!<br><br>We would've loved to go on trying more of the pastas, but we were told it would be wise if we left room for some of their fantastic desserts. We went with the Tiramisu and the Bomboloni. The Tiramisu is Fabio's grandmother's recipe and grandma did not disappoint! I like to think of myself as somewhat of a Tiramisu connoisseur because I try it everywhere. Â Siena Tavern's rendition is without a doubt one of my favs. Rich and creamy yet it still feels light when you take a bite. Tiramisu perfection!<br><br>The Bomboloni is also worth a sweet splurge at the end of your meal. Warm, airy dough covered in sugar and served with 3 different sauces in squeeze bottles-yes, you want this. You can squeeze the whisky-caramel, chocolate hazelnut, or lemon-maple sauce into the bomboloni at your discretion but in my experience more is better!<br><br>Of course no meal at the restaurant of a famous chef is complete without a picture with the chef! Fabio was visiting tables in the bar and dining room all night and before we left we asked if we could grab him for a quick hello. He graciously posed for a picture with me and my night was complete!

Our waiter was AWESOME--he actually took the time to talk to us about our visit to Chicago, and went over the menu in depth. <br><br>We were recommended to start with the coccoli, which is a must order item at Siena's. It's a fancier, modern take of your usual bread, meat and cheese starters...and the drizzle of honey and pesto made it burst with flavor. <br><br>What stood out to me on the entrees list was their squid ink pasta with lobster. I hardly see squid ink pasta, so I was so excited to try his take. The pasta was SO fresh and the right dente-ness, had plenty of lobster chunks including a tail on top. The portion was also really nice for what was going to be a heavy brunch altogether. This was so delicious and I would come back to Siena Tavern just to have the dish again.<br><br>Their chicken sandwich was also tasty. Nothing to cry about in terms of sandwiches, but well executed. The fries were some of the best that I've had, as it wasn't salty at all, had cheese on it and you are provided with ketchup and a lemon/garlicky mayo. <br><br>Finally, we ended our meal with their bomboli, which is a fun interactive dessert: 4 fried donuts that come with 4 sauces in squeeze bottles. You stick 'em into the donuts, and fill it in with cream. A very good dessert that ends your meal in giggles. Could not detect the whiskey in that caramel sauce, however.

Â This dish is four warm doughnuts that come with three sauces in squeeze bottles (fancy variations on caramel, chocolate, and strawberry) that you can fill the doughnuts with - so fun and delicious.<br><br>For such a nice restaurant in River North, the prices here are incredibly fair. Â The wine list has a ton of reasonably priced options which surprised me.

He has never been a fan of honey, but the honey they put on this dish is out of this world. I'm not sure where they source it from, but there is definitely something to be said about good ingredients. <br><br>Ossobuco - This dish is big enough to share between 2 people if you order a 2-3 other small plates. There is nothing I don't like about this dish, but my absolute favorite is that bone marrow that they serve with a small fork. The meat is flavorful and literally melts in your mouth. I particularly like that they serve this with farro mushroom risotto -- infusing umami every way possible into this dish! <br><br>From the crudo bar, we have tried the ahi tuna andhamachi -- both solid dishes, but the portions are small so I don't know it's worth the value. <br><br>This place gets packed and is always booked up.

Service was friendly and attentive, and our server was a very chill guy who seemed to know his stuff.<br><br>To start, we had a pear and prosciutto pizza and the coccoli. The pizza was fantastic, definitely up there with the likes of Balena, etc. Good crust, and toppings were a great combo. The coccoli was one of the best things I've ever had. It is a must-try at Siena Tavern. Such a simple concept, but so, so delicious. The crispy dough was heavenly, the cheese rich and creamy, and the truffle honey... don't even get me started. So good! Sweet with just the right essence of truffles. Great start to the meal!<br><br>For our entrees, we chose the pasta in a jar, gnocchi, squid ink linguine, and the osso buco. The pasta in a jar was good, but not outstanding. The pasta itself was perfectly al dente, but I felt like the flavors were a little bland. There was blue cheese in this dish, but you'd never know after eating it (I don't like blue cheese, so this worked out fine for me). The squid ink linguine was very good, and had a nice bit of lobster on top. However, the gnocchi was definitely the best pasta dish of the three we ordered. The gnocchi were perfect little pillows, soft and chewy and creamy. Just delicious. The sauce was both rich and light at the same time, and had great flavor of truffles. This dish was definitely the star on our table. The osso buco was also well prepared. Big piece of tender veal, lots of marrow in the shank bone, and a healthy scoop of farro risotto. Our only complaint about the entrees was that a couple--the pasta in a jar and the osso buco in particular--lacked salt. We asked for salt, which made each of these dishes so much better. If the kitchen can just season a tad bit better, all of these dishes would be stars.<br><br>Side dishes were good. We had the brussel sprouts and shishito peppers. The brussels were good, but the shishito peppers were very well prepared. I don't like spicy, and luckily all of the ones I ate were mild!<br><br>For dessert, we ordered the monkey bread, the gelato flight, and the bomboloni. Be aware, these portions are HUGE! The monkey bread was quite tasty, but a little difficult to eat because of how hard it was. The gelato flight was good, and is definitely a great way to sample Siena's many flavors. We tried salted caramel, s'mores, pistachio, and brown butter peanut. The brown butter peanut was the best in my opinion. S'mores was also very good. I found pistachio a little on the sweet side, and salted caramel could have used more caramel flavor. Of the desserts, though, the bomboloni were the best. These were huge beignet-like pieces of fried dough coated in sugar and served with \"Nutella,\" raspberry, and caramel sauces. Our server recommended we inject our bombolonis using the squeeze bottles the sauces were served in, which is a fun concept for this tasty dessert. I've never had fried dough that didn't taste good, but these bomboloni were a true hit. Slightly crisp on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside. Delicious. We were celebrating a birthday, and they brought us a big scoop of birthday cake gelato with a candle, which was a nice touch.<br><br>Overall, great experience at Siena Tavern. If I could make one complaint, it's that the menu is too broad! (Does this count as a complaint?) With only four people dining, it was so hard to make decisions on what to order, as literally everything sounded awesome.

My friends thought it was way too bitter and two of them didn't finish it. I had the chicken sandwich. It was good, but it's a chicken sandwich and fries. One friend had the burger, which was also good (although really salty) but again, it's a burger and they're not a burger place.

Â Yeaaaa...<br><br>-Pappardelle: sauce bolognese, grated parmesan. Â Classic sauce with homemade pasta, well done.<br><br>-Spaghetti: jumbo lump crab, charred grape tomato, red chili & lemon sauce. If I had to pick, this was my favorite dish ordered. Â Really unique combination of flavors, well done chef.<br><br>-Seared Scallop: shaved fennel, blood orange, frisee, watercress, capers. Â Really good quality scallops, perfectly prepared and a nice combination of flavors, but probably could've saved some money and gotten another pasta instead. Â Still really enjoyed this dish.<br><br>-Coccoli: crispy dough, stracchino cheese, prosciutto di parma, truffle honey. Â This was a really unique dish, unlike anything I've had before. Â The flavors worked really well together and the dough was super fresh and warm.<br><br>-Grilled Octopus: duck fat potatoes, red chilies, celery, aged balsamic, chive.

Â Huge meatballs smothered in awesome tomato sauce. Â Tender and very Italiano.<br><br>-Burrata: tomato jam, sea salt, basil oil. Â Melt-in-your-mouth creamy & salted cheese with a unique tomato jam to join.<br><br>-Monkeybread: hazelnut cream, caramel, candied hazelnuts. Â Just when we thought we had no room left for dessert, we managed to scarf this down without a problem.<br><br>The cocktails were also very tasty, but pricey as expected.

I can't speak on it much other than that.<br>- Three others at the table each ordered the meatball sandwich and devoured it!

Our server, Devin, said that it was rated top (or one of the top) lobster rolls in the city. OK buddy... I'll be the judge of that. Full disclosure, I'm not generally a fan of lobster to begin with but lobster rolls are different (to me) and I tend to like them better than just dipping lobster in warm butter. It was good. Full of flavor and tons of lobster squeezing out of the roll. They didn't skimp on the portion... and you know lobster ain't cheap!<br>- Lastly, the fries... man, the fries were so tasty. Each sandwich came with them and they were topped with grated parmesan cheese. The cheese... gosh, I really never thought about grating parmesan on fries before... that's about to be my new thing! <br><br>Needless to say, I really enjoyed my FULL sized lunch at Siena Tavern.

Basically its 4 huge balls of dough that you eat with cheese and prosciutto. <br><br>Next we ordered our entrees. We split the gnocchi and the squid ink pasta, both my choices. These were both AMAZING. The truffle gnocchi was everything I've always dreamed of. The gnocchi was so pillowy and the sauce so flavorful, I seriously was still thinking about it the next day. I would go back just to get this and call it a night. The squid ink pasta was also delicious. I will say the portion is a little small for the price, but I guess that's expected when lobster is involved.

Â Ostensibly an Italian restaurant but with pastas and secondi somewhat limited at brunch it was with elation that the restaurant's oft cited gnocchi arrived as good as the rumors with potato clouds so light they'd have floated away without the hefty yet balanced sauce and not to be outdone the aromatic pizza would also prove admirable with a golden crust featuring robust crunch and a lightly yeasty crumb beneath a hefty layer earthy mushrooms and just enough truffle oil to enhance but not overwhelm. Â Certainly not leaving without dessert it can only be said that Siena Tavern saved the best for last and although the dessert-menu staple Monkeybread was excellent it was the DIY Bombolini and Saba and Custard soaked cheesecake parfait feigning as French Toast that stole the show; the later almost indescribably complex and a 'must order' for fans of sweet and savory alike.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CBcM6cmSIXOqePYjBZENFg/348s.jpg", "caption": "Truffle Mushroom Pizza - Roasted Wild Mushrooms, Garlic Cream, Mozzarella, White Truffle Oil"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0UlQaY7v8t9A7laAsEvU2g/168s.jpg", "caption": "Lobster Hash - Poached Eggs, Truffle Hollandaise"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mZcbHZT6NvI64JEfp3QV_Q/168s.jpg", "caption": "Gnocchi - Truffle Cream, Fried Sage, Crispy Pancetta"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "This is a great place to go with friends!

The third was for brunch and it wasn't the greatest experience out of the three. <br><br>For dinner, I've had the waygu beef meatball, the coccoli, the mozzerella sampler, the cheese plate, the squid ink lobster linguini, the scallop risotto, and the lamb chops. All were excellent (especially the coccoli and cheese plate), except I thought the scallop risotto was too salty for my liking and just a little too rich. The lamb chops were grilled with a really nice char but a bit fatty (which lamb chops are sometimes). We ordered pumpkin gelato and espresso for dessert and both were superb (I'm a coffee and dessert snob). Loved our server both times for dinner.

We were sat immediately with a reservation at a nice table in the bar, so we could kind of see the Bears game. Our server came over and sounded like a robot. No personality the entire time and didn't make it very fun. She actually made one of my friends feel somewhat uncomfortable. When we ordered, my friend ordered a side of fries with her salad. The server proceeded to ask her if she wanted the fries for the table to share. \"Um...no\" my friend responded. Awkward. If she wanted fries for the entire table to share, don't ya think she would of specified that?!? Anyways, our order was placed. <br><br>Then about 30 min later, our server came by again and explained to me that their waffle iron just broke and they couldn't make my Nutella waffles. Fine, it happens. She apologized and recommended something similar and I ordered it. Five minutes later, the rest of my parties food comes out and I sit there with no food. I mean she couldn't of told me earlier that the waffle iron broke so that I could of ate with the rest of my party? Or even offer me something to nibble on while I wait?

The dish also came with goat toast, basically thin bread with melted goat cheese on top. My hubby and friend LOVED their benedicts.

Amazing food....outstanding service....all in a beautiful, high-energy spot. (And all of you people that are only ordering pizzas?? Stop it! You're probably hurting the chef's feelings...and you are certainly missing out on some of the most incredible food of your life.) We went again last night for my nephew's birthday, and started with the Wagyu Beef Meatball, and the Roasted Beets Salad. Both very solid...especially the beet salad. A very nice start to our meal, but only whetting our appetite for the pastas. Besides the must-have Spaghetti (see my previous review for raves), we tried the Squid Ink Linguini (with lobster tail and lobster cream sauce) and the Truffle Gnocchi. Whoa, the Gnocchi was melt-in-your-mouth heavenly! Our waitress suggested getting it without the truffle oil, and I highly recommend that....with only the shaved truffle and the truffle cream sauce, it was already rich enough to put a Rockefeller to shame. So, in order of faves...I recommend 1) the Spaghetti, 2) the Gnocchi, 3) the Squid-Ink Linguini. (Seriously...see my previous review...you HAVE got to try the Spaghetti!)<br><br>Also worth mentioning is the stellar customer service at this place. From the managers to the bussers to the hostesses, they are on top of their game in making sure you have an enjoyable evening. Whenever you can have a pre-dinner drink at the bar, Duke will never steer you wrong. He is attentive, friendly, and spot-on with recommendations. (BTW...if you are a fan of stouts, if they still have the Verdi Imperial Stout, it's a winner.)

Our server was Svetlana, and she was very attentive, cheerful, and got all of our orders and requests right. My mom is very picky about having her coffee/tea extremely hot so we made sure to tell Svetlana that, and she made sure my mom's cappuccino was perfect.

The french toast was good, presentation was great (as was the presentation for every dish we ordered), but I was expecting more of an actual tiramisu flavor.

Though it was a fairly spur-of-the moment decision, I had no difficulty securing a spot, even calling about 45 minutes or so ahead to reserve. I later learned from my server that there were 50 cancellations that day for lunch, so methinks that was the reason I was accommodated so promptly. <br><br>As to the food itself, the fare on offer here is right up my alley--modern classics, well presented and plated, with fresh ingredients. As I was studying my options on the menus ($33 and $22 fixed price menus for Restaurant Week lunch), I decided to take the edge off with a glass of wine. I went with the Malbec- an excellent pour that I knew would pair equally well with lighter and slightly heartier fare. The wine was just what the doctor ordered on this otherwise gloomy February day, with falling snow and falling stocks parading by on the CNBC ticker on the flat screen above my head. The menu offerings all looked promising but I was finally able to decide on my options--shaved brussel sprout salad with marcona almonds to start, shrimp risotto for the main, and salted caramel gelato for dessert. This is way more than I usually eat for lunch, but I knew what would be facing me outside (more snow and cold), running of errands, and an extended salon appointment.<br><br>All of the dishes were standouts, though I must say the risotto was among the best I've ever tasted. Risotto is easy to screw up, as it tends to get either gummy or granular. This was not the case at Siena, and the presentation (a couple of shrimp on top of the dish along with shrimp pieces within the risotto) was well executed. The dessert-salted caramel gelato-stole the show and is a worthy successor to the gelato offerings at Rhapsody (RIP). Siena's dessert chef makes the gelato in-house, so this is definitely a must try. I'll also point out that the service was extremely efficient. In fact, I was in and out of here in less time than at some fast-casual spots which shall remain nameless. <br><br>Sometimes, an indulgent experience at lunch is not optional, but required. From the excellent bites to the stellar service, last week's experience satisfied on all counts.

From the Brick Chicken Diavolo (Which was my main course that I highly recommend) to the Margherita pizza, and the Gnocchi (which was also to die for, with a truffle cream sauce that was delectable enough to roll around in.) Then, just when you think you are stuffed to the brim, they hand you the desert menu and immediately tell you about their Bomboloni. 4 hand made, fresh donuts that are made to perfection. They bring them out in a bag with three sauce bottles filled with Whisky-Carmel, Chocolate Hazelnut, and raspberry chianti on the side to fill, or cover, your house mad doughnuts.

Â If this was to be more of a neapolitan pizza, the dough is over worked and chewey, as opposed to light. Â The corncione is tougher than I expected, as is the rest of the dough as well, but it's not a bad pizza, just not a great one.<br><br>Tavern burger ($16): Â Wow. Â Seriously, good burger. Â While I was a bit concerned since we had to order the burger medium well to well done (my friend is having her second baby!), the burger came out tender, juicy, and spectacular. Â I have to say, I was very impressed with their burger, which is why they've got the four star rating. Â <br><br>Side note: Â They are SERIOUS about refilling your water... I think no less than 4 different water waiters came by to refill at least 8 times, and they'd reach across the table in front of us each time to refill our glasses, unfortunately interrupting conversation and making it a slightly awkward moment each time. Â The drawback of booths is that they can't come up behind you, but in this case, it may have been better to have the glasses at the end of the table instead of resetting it so that they needed to reach in front of us every time. Â Slow down with the water refills! Â We don't need a refill each time we drink a quarter of the glass!<br><br>Verdict: Â A tasty place (particularly the burger), and I look forward to coming back to try their pasta!

My husband ordered the short rib ravioli, which was served with a sweet and savory mushroom sauce.

It was so delicious-- the fresh lemony flavor with rich crab and cream sauce. <br><br>And as if we hadn't eaten enough... we ordered dessert. Siena Tavern serves a wide selection of homemade gelati.

The bar area is adequately separated from the dining tables and it appears that the many of the tables are plush semi-circle booths that make it easy to see and talk to everyone in your party.

We split the coccoli, which I think is a perfect example of the inventiveness of the chef. Fried dough balls with honey, prosciutto, and cheese? Amazing. I liked my Farro Risotto entree but I actually liked the flavor of my friend's short rib ravioli better.

My FIL ordered the Wild Boar pizza (butternut squash and a bunch of other things I don't really know) and it had the most unique taste for a pizza I've ever had. It had a sweetness to it.

My MIL ordered the Pasta in a Jar. Normally, I would not try this because it has mushrooms in it, but everyone was saying what a unique taste it had, so I had to take a small bite.

Â It was so good I took a little bit off the plates of three friends who ordered it so I would eat all of someone's. Â The risotto was also notable. Â It was HUGE too. Â The entree that was a complete fail though was mine - the Seared Scallop (not singular...comes with 4). Â It was so incredibly salty that I honestly could not even eat one whole scallop. Â I tried. Â I really did. Â Even tried scraping off the top green sauce and it was still hurting my tongue with the salt content. Â The greens and puree underneath was salty too which just ruined my taste buds. Â I would have sent it back to the kitchen, expect I ate so much of my friend's plates that I wouldn't have been able to eat another entree anyway. Â <br><br>So - is it fair for me to give it 3 stars just because of the scallops? Â Yes - it is a main entree and a waste of money and appetite. Â No - to be completely fair I should allow another visit to try the dish again but I just can't make my mouth suffer again like that.

Â A few standouts for me have been the Brick Chicken (one of the best chicken dishes in Chicago - hands down!) - also the Burnt Pepperoni Pizza and the Kale Cesar Salad. Â The Burata from the Mozzarella Bar is also delicious.

Regardless, no big deal, just an annoyance.<br><br>When our waiter took our orders, he closed his notepad and walked away without even taking my order. I had to shout for him to take mine. I ordered a glass of wine that never showed up. Again, I had to tell him he forgot the only drink our table ordered and when I told him to forget about it, since I was halfway thru our entrÃ©e by the time he came by to check on us, he just said \"okay\" and walked away. No apology, no complimentary glass, nada. <br><br>He brought the check by and we watched him for a solid 15-20 minutes schmoozing with another coworker in the corner while we waited for him to pick it up so we could leave.

I left somewhat in limbo, hence the three star rating.<br><br>The decor and layout of the restaurant is awesome. Large, comfortable booths, two massive bars, and a rustic interior. I was a fan. The service was also fantastic--we had a friendly, attentive waiter that even noticed our table was a bit wobbly half way through the meal (slightly wobbly, but not enough for us to complain), and he came out to fix it.<br><br>The food is where I left wanting more, and it is the reason that I docked two stars. We started out with the coccoli, which comes highly recommended on yelp. I had no complaints. The fried dough was exceptional--crispy on the outside with a nice doughey-ness on the inside. The accompanying cheese was also delightful, and it had a nice freshness and a buttery consistency. Where this dish missed was in the truffle honey, which others on here seemed to have loved. Instead, I found it a bit overpowering and too reliant on the honey flavor. As a result, this dish was just good, but it could have been great.<br><br>Next, we had the short rib ravioli. A very one-dimensional dish with no real flavor development. It was good (because how can ravioli be bad), but I expected more. I think some more flavor depth would have helped this rather uncreative dish.<br><br>Finally, we had the truffle mushroom pizza, which was probably my least favorite dish of the night. As with the coccoli, the dough was phenomenal. Whoever is behind the creation of that dough deserves some James Beard recognition. The rest of the pizza was a complete miss. The mushrooms were charred, which gave them a bitterness that did not mesh with the rest of the pizza. Also, the garlic flavor stole the show and completely overpowered the other flavors that were trying to come out. An unfortunate end to the meal.<br><br>Part of the blame might fall on us, as we did not order the gnocchi that is so highly regarded on here. But from what I experienced, the food fell a bit short in what is otherwise a very solid restaurant.

If you're a new spot and you encounter people who've never been, I, personally like to know the menu's approach, the idea behind the cuisine, actually anything... I got nothing. That I can easily forgive. The fact that our table was consistently filled with dirty plates, we never got refills, he never checked back on any course but dessert...kind of unforgivable. Also, he noticed how we'd stacked all of our dirty plates in the middle if the table, and we still had to ask if he could clear it and then he blamed his busser. <br>The food was okay, not mind-blowing and certainly not worth the price tag. We had the meatball (it's a ball if meat, can't really mess that up) with a savory tomato sauce as an appetizer. I had the squid ink linguine which was good, that's where I attribute the stars. The tiramisu was a disaster and tasted awful. The monkey bread was okay but it wasn't warm or as gooey as I like mine... Just kind of dry and lukewarm. <br>I just wanted to be impressed or actually just being served would have been awesome. Just a pretty solid let down.

Â We've heard about the place and always wanted to try it, so I thought it would be a perfect spot to celebrate the occasion. Â When I made the reservation **I specified that it was for his birthday, a special occasion,** so if anything could be done to enhance his experience, it would be greatly appreciated. Â I wasn't expecting the red carpet treatment, maybe just a dessert with a candle in it (obviously I would pay, DUH), a card or a signed menu from the executive chef, or a simple acknowledgement of his birthday from the server (which I have come to expect based on all experiences I have had at other high-end restaurants). Â None of that happened. Â Further more, I had a friend of mine, an avid gourmand who also works in the restaurant industry, confirm my reservation and reiterate the importance of the evening. Â She spoke with Steve whom she said was very nice and reassured her that everything would be taken care of. Â So I was obviously under the impression that we would have a nice evening and that there was going to be some sort of recognition that this was a special occasion; hence, the month plus advance planning in order to make sure this request could be accommodated.<br><br>Things started off badly, they sat us at a high top next to the bar, and I felt like I was at a first-come, first-serve sports bar seating area. Â Not only was it annoying to have people bump into my chair the entire night, but it was annoying to see three unutilized booths in the restaurant that we easily could have been seated at.<br><br>Food:<br>The food was extremely underwhelming. Â The only thing that we enjoyed was the oysters. Â I shouldn't fail to mention that the food is obnoxiously over-priced. Â I don't mind paying high prices for dinner, but the food better be worth my while- it certainly was not. Â We ordered:<br><br>Burrata Mozzarella: There was so much salt that I literally had to spit it out. Â It was absolutely disgusting. It's funny that this seems to be a common theme in most of these reviews. TAKE A HINT. Â Even my boyfriend, who appreciates salt more than I do had trouble eating it; however, finished it because he was so hungry due to our late reservation.<br><br>Parmesan Sage Fries: They were just OK. Â It's hard to like anything else after you have tried the fries with aioli at Au Cheval; oh my goodness I'm salivating just thinking about it! Anything in comparison is just, meh. Â The aioli at this restaurant tasted like ranch dressing. Â They also brought out the fries immediately after the Burrata as an appetizer when we specifically asked for them to be brought as a side with our meal. Â Mistiming and misplacement-ordering seems to be another theme in these reviews. Â TAKE ANOTHER HINT. Â In all fairness, the server noticed this after-the-fact and apologized for the mistake.<br><br>Gemmeli (I'm not sure what it's called, but, it's a fusili pasta dish with duck and some pitiful sauce). Â The pasta was cooked well, but the duck was so gummy. Â And they must have run out of salt after making the Burrata because the sauce was incredibly bland. Â I absolutely love pasta, but this was terribly disappointing!!!<br><br>Mediterranean Seafood Brodetto: My boyfriend had this dish; it satisfied him, but it wasn't anything he was raving about. Â His quote, \"I've had better.\" <br><br>We heard great things about the donuts, but we opted to skip dessert because we were so frustrated we just wanted to LEAVE.<br><br>Service:<br>Based on what I had mentioned earlier in this review I'm not happy with managing staff, but I can't knock the server because she did her job. Â She was the only positive aspect of the entire experience. Â She was very attentive, offered suggestions/recommendations, and she spoke loud enough for us to hear her. Â Unfortunately it's not enough to alter my perception of this \"restaurant\".<br><br>Ambiance:<br>I'm quite confused, am I eating at a restaurant? Or a bar? I felt like I was at a high end Moe's. Â Don't get me wrong, big screen TVs, bars, and high tops are great when I am trying to watch a game Sunday afternoon, have a casual dinner, etc... but when choosing a supposedly high quality restaurant to spend a special occasion at, it was obnoxiously distracting. Â I was looking for a nice, special evening with mind-blowing food. Â If they wanted to offer both atmospheres then it should have been clearly separated, for example how Tavernita has Barcito.<br><br>So if you made it through my review, congrats! You can tell that I'm obviously pissed. Â If you are looking for good food don't bother with this place, especially for a nice occasion.

But man was I disappointed . Salty as all hell, bread was burned, and this jam that went a long with it was just so Bland. I honestly could have cried- how are you an \"Italian\" restaurant and mess up such a basic plate. There was a drizzle of balsamic vinegar which was good, but not enough to recover the salty, burned and bland mess they served us. <br><br>The girlfriend ordered this duck pasta. Again, LOOKED AWESOME. I put a bite in my mouth and thought my taste buds had disappeared. This was their highly touted HOMEMADE pasta? Seriously? The waitress even commented \"oh man, that's a great dish\" when she put the order in. Was this woman delusional? I'm not sure... <br><br>I ordered this seafood Brodetto dish- A seafood mixture in a spicy tomato broth. It was actually halfway decent (THANK GOD). I can't lie about that. But again, I'm a human garbage can and enjoy pretty much everything. I have ordered a similar dish at several other restaurants in the city and this was probably the worst of them all. Whatever, I can deal with it.<br><br>Lastly we had a order of sage fries with some sort of garlic aioli. It was OK, not the best by any means. But lets be Honest...

Since I can see the list of everything that was off or bad getting long we will continue this in list form.<br><br>--no hostess at the door. I am sorry its 11pm on a Sunday but you are a bar and it says you are open until 2am on your website. There were 18 bus boys and smiling bartenders and it took us wandering in for someone to ask what we needed...<br><br>--we went to the bar, food bar whatever, and asked a girl if we could still eat or get a waitress and she directed a bus boy to ask the manager...this guy walked over with a big attitude and stood about a full foot shorter than my 5 foot tall frame and said \"what's up\". The only real Italian thing in this place at this point was my temper. The place screamed typical bar, no surprise since they are opened by the same group as Public and Bull & Bear, and certainly the customer service was as far away from inviting as you can get. Not a representation of anything Italian I'd be proud of. He explained some bs that since they were slow they were going to close, 3 hours ahead of schedule....but if we wanted a quick pizza then to order it now. In retrospect I should have said see ya at this point. <br><br>--we sat down because we felt so awkward and just ordered a margherita pizza. It was like any other you can get from Frankie's Scallopine or any of the million pizza places in Chicago. For $15 I was super unimpressed and thank God we only stuck to that item. No drinks even. The bartender was trying to be nice but I think she even knows that 3 weeks into this place opening it is a bust. The best place is to find a balance between outstanding customer service, delicious food, a beautiful environment all for a price that matches these, and this place failed to meet all of these criteria. <br><br>--on a really disgusting side note I ran to the bathroom and was washing my hands and couldn't find the hand soap...they had a bottle of C.O. Bigelow BODYWASH. Seriously who manages this place? Anyways, an older woman next to me was furiously wiping her nose and appeared quite jittery after coming out of the stall and seeing someone else in the bathroom.

Â Sure its not cheap, but for River North anything less than $100 for a good meal and a quick buzz seems like a relative bargain.

I really liked the flavor of the crust but it was a little thin for me. If you like really thin crust pizza though you'd dig it! I actually found the salad and cauliflower to be the real stars of the night, the caesar salad dressing really paired nicely with the kale and the cauliflower had a nice lemon flavor and was paired perfectly with some really flavorful peppers.

The four is based on the theory that out of every restaurant in the universe, is this venue a 5? Like perhaps the French Laundry in CA? No, but in it's category, it definitely is a 5.<br>If you want to eat here, you'd better plan ahead...way ahead.This is one happening place...by 5pm on Thursday, the bar is filled and a lot of dining tables are, too. In no time at all, it is standing room only and you have to raise your voice to be heard. <br>The atmosphere is trendy, but Â not overwhelmingly so. We sat at a high top table near Â the open oven. At first I was not happy with this, because sometimes at a high top, you have to scramble a bit to sit down(really up) and your feet dangle-so uncomfortable. They have mitigated this by having a foot rail for your feet on the upholstered side of the table, and the chairs have foot rails, too. It was fine. The kitchen is a beehive of activity - not an open kitchen except for the oven, but we could still see the activity through the doorway. Surprisingly,as it was so busy, somehow we did not feel rushed. We had a very pleasant server - just the right mix of attentiveness, humor and information. My husband was seated facing a wall of mirrors. Our daughter remarked that if she was ever at a business meeting, she would take the seat underneath the mirrors, because the mirrors would distract her colleague from the conversation, giving her the advantage.<br>The food, which was what we were there for....my gosh, really good. We tried different items and shared, so we could test the waters, so to speak. There was not one clunker in the bunch. The only thing I would change is that the toasted bread that came with the meatball could have been a little less toasted. <br>Surprisingly, the stand out dish at our table was the lasagna. Our daughter, in all the years I've made lasagna, always turns her nose up and rarely eats it. I think the only time she has ever eaten lasagna in a restaurant was in Italy, where she had to admit, it was tasty. Now, I'm slightly insulted that my lasagna didn't make the grade, but this was seriously good and interestingly flavored lasagna.<br>She dipped into Sienna Tavern's lasagna at least 3 more times...tiny bites bursting with flavor! She said that she didn't know what was in it, but clearly it is something highly addictive. By the way, I read another yelp review which said that the pasta was boxed....I don't know what that person had, but the pappardelle was most definitely not from a box...it is from scratch. <br>Are wide, shallow champagne glasses back in favor?! Because for our Prosecco, that's what they used. I smiled....I am digging out my monogrammed silver wedding toasting goblets that have not seen the light of day for decades, not even for anniversaries. Â Everything old is new again?!<br>We had a fruit tart, which was delicious - piled high with strawberries, sweet blackberries, raspberries and blueberries - they did not skimp on the fruit....the tart crust itself was admirable, as was the custard....there was also a dollop of gelato? on the plate...very good.<br>What really makes a restaurant 5 star in my opinion, is whether or not I would go back. Yes, in a heartbeat. Siena Tavern Â has all the bells and whistles it needs.. Â Go for decor, the youthful, professional energy, to people watch, and last, but really first and most importantly, the food.<br>ps....it also has a very nice, and spotless ladies room.

Â Very competitive area for food. Â  Well, he may have staying power as long as the crowds don't mind paying up to $16 for a pizza and upwards of $30 for a main course and $12 for parking. Â Now, little things. Â Had a very nice beet salad, but we also ordered the Truffle Pizza and the salad plate remained on the table for the pizza. Â A restaurant of this nature should have taken the salad plate and replaced it immediately. Â Servers and bus boys ned to know this. Â  Also, forks were used, taken but not replaced until after we received our next course. Â Finally, my wife's decaf coffee was just colored weak water and the server did not bring cream or sugar and this had to be requested. Â Again, a restaurant of this type should not skimp on the coffee and should bring what is required without asking. Â <br>Service was good and attentive and young, but the car park was quite slow in taking my car. Â The message starts on the outside. Â Now the food which is billed as rustic italian. I don't know. Â Maybe rustic with modern takes. Â  We had a beet salad, a truffle pizza, the short rib ravioli, the gnocchi and the sea bass and the sticky parmesan potatoes, which are more like what you would get at a Â Sunday breakfast with eggs, and finished with the donuts and dipping sauces and pistachio gelato, and a nice bottle of wine.

Â The room is beautiful and must have cost a small fortune to put together. Â Now, all they need to do is stay consistent, hope people don't have a problem spending the kind of dollars they are asking and keep filling the place. Â Last night, there was a steady stream of people so that may not be a problem, but foodies are fickle and once the next hot thing comes along, they move on. Â Finally, I had a nice conversation with one of the young managers. Â We talked about the restaurant and the area, and just lots of general stuff.

At 4:45 we entered a virtually empty restaurant. This was the latest time I could get on open table 2 weeks ahead. Very puzzling considering the restaurant remained only about a quarter full the entire time we were there. When we were escorted to the first table the host was told to lead us to, it was dirty. After getting seated at the booth next to the dirty one, we ordered a truffle mushroom pizza which we had enjoyed at our first visit. This time the topping covered about 2/3 of the crust with a good 3 inches of empty crust left. Plain old dough. Ugh. <br>We ordered the Tuscan kale Caesar salad Â which was fine and 2 pastas: the gnocchi and the tagliatelle. Both were meh. No real flavor from either and our gnocchi was missing the fried sage.

We also had the Kobe meatball, which was the best meatball I've ever eaten (I'm Italian, so I've eaten my fair share of meatballs). First of all this meatball was huge and was covered with shaved cheese and served with amazing sauce. The meatball was perfectly cooked and just wonderful. We also ordered the buffala mozzarella, which was so creamy and soft and delicious. It was served with an amazing sweet, smoky sauce. The best cheese I've eaten. <br>Then for our entrees we had the Carne pizza, and the short rib ravioli. First the pizza was probably a 14 inch and it was enough to feed 2-3 people comfortably. The meat on the pizza was spicy and plentiful. The cheese, the mozzarella which was amazing. <br>The short rib ravioli in a mushroom sauce was delicious.

How can I even put it into words. It was slow and disorganized. She approached our table and we ordered coffees and an order of the Bomboloni to start. It took nearly 10 min to get our coffees. The donuts came soon after. However, our server didn't come back until after we were finished. Then she shows up asking if we wanted to order any starters. What?? We are here for brunch and besides, what do you think the bomboloni were? So we place our orders and she disappears again. Our dishes were dropped off by a food runner but our flatware was never replaced. So we're sitting there waiting for someone, anyone to come by the table. Plus, we had to ask for our coffees to be refilled each time. After our plates were cleared, she showed up again to drop off dessert menus and then disappeared again. When she came back, she didn't ask if we had decided on dessert, she just dropped off the check and walked away. She was unprofessional, disconnected, and not qualified to work at a restaurant of this caliber($100+ checks). The kicker was that no one wished my mom a happy birthday.

We for sure looked like gluttons but it was so so good and after tax & tip it was $47 a person! <br><br>We started with the coccoli which was my FAVORITE thing we ate. It's fried dough balls, served on a platter of prosciutto, fresh mozzarella and basil oil. You are supposed to tear open the dough balls and shove in the goodness and make a quasi-sandwich. Ohhhhh my, so good. We also started with the waygu beef meatball which was huge, moist and had a bit of a lemony flavor to it. Very nice. On to the harvest salad that had all kinds of goodies in it (apple, candied hazelnuts, pomegranate seeds) and a refreshing spiced apple vinaigrette. We then chose a pasta-the butternut squash tortellacci. There were five ravioli-like pieces of butternut squash pasta in a brown sugar buttery creamy sauce. This dish is rich and understandably served small, as I was content with my one piece. Finally, we ordered two pizzas. Wrong decision as we were stuffed and barely put a dent in either. We assumed these would be like flatbreads but they're very big and could easily feed two. We ordered one with all different meats on it and one with pear, arugala and garlic cream. The latter was more of my kind of flavor, but I would have preferred them both to be cooked a little longer. All in all a wonderful meal! <br><br>The icy on top of the entire visit was seeing Fabio at the bar, checking out the madness.

Booked on OpenTable in February to secure a 7 pm res (before the place even opened!) We had to adjust the reservation downwards, from 4 to 2 ppl, two days before dining there, and they had no issue with that. <br><br>Decor: Nice vibe overall. Gigantic bar, as mentioned by several. Like the tables and chairs (so comfortable!!!) and the booths looked intimate too. Not too packed together; comfortable. They have an herb wall where they apparently grow the herbs for the food!<br><br>Drinks: Got the #9 -- delicious! We both loved that. My sister got the #2 as well, which was delicious. The waitress recommended a glass of pinot noir for me -- that was only OK. <br><br>Food: Oh, the food. Just delicious from start to finish. We started with the meatball (huge, moist, delicious, covered in ricotta and divine tomato sauce) -- wonderful. Also got the bone marrow -- the presentation is great, with two huge bones that you scrape out and put on toasted bread with a lovely fennel salad and mushrooms. Just heavenly. For dinner, we got the squid ink pasta with lobster ($$$, but they do not skimp on the lobster) and the afore-mentioned GNOCCHI! The squid ink pasta was divine -- cooked just perfectly, with a tomato-cream sauce and lovely chunks of lobster everywhere over the black pasta. The gnocchi was just divine -- I have never in my life tasted such soft, pillowy (that is really the only word to describe it) gnocchi and realize now that the reason that I probably was indifferent on gnocchi before was because it was never made like THIS! It is dressed in a cream based truffle sauce with bits of pancetta and fried sage. The entire meal was amazing, but I dream of that gnocchi even now! Finally, for dessert -- the tiramisu was inventively presented in a little tin pan with meringues on the side (along with a picture of a tree in cocoa -- or espresso? not sure, didn't taste it alone) Â <br><br>Be warned that all this food is HEAVY and they give reasonable-sized portions -- go hungry! <br><br>Service: Initially, we sat for a bit before anyone approached us. Finally, our waitress Natalie (? I think that was her name) came by, and she certainly made up for that -- she was engaging, charming, funny, and very enthusiastic about her job. She answered the requisite \"where's Fabio?\" questions with humor and a smile. Her recommendations were great. (I asked her for a glass of Pinot Noir, and she told me the one they serve by the glass -- it was only OK, but that is not her fault!) My sister had wanted to take home some leftover squid ink pasta, and the busboy accidentally threw it away!-- the waitress was so sweet that she went and talked to the kitchen and had them prepare an ADDITIONAL half serving of the pasta for her (complete with delicious lobster, which in the original dish we had definitely eaten ALL of :) ) to take home at no extra charge!

Definitely worth a trip.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This place had amazing octopus, a great atmosphere, and the server Jessica was adorable and informative.

Â I am on the fence - our experience was 50/50. Â I ordered drink #4 to start Â - it was delicious, like nothing I have ever tasted! Â We started with the cocoli while we were looking over the menu. Â The combination of the cheese, puff and honey was amazing. Â Here is where things start to go awry. Â We ordered the farro salad, smoked mozzarella and lasagna. Â I also ordered a glass of wine. Â Less than 5 minutes later, here comes the salad AND lasagna - no wine, no mozzarella. Â The waitress did notice pretty quickly and brought the remaining items, but I felt like things could have been paced out a little better. Â If I had known, we would have ordered as we went so we had more time to enjoy our meal. Â The lasagna was still steaming hot by the time we got to it since it is served in a crock. Â Also, we were seated at the high top tables near the pizza bar and felt stalked by the people waiting at the bar who thought the tables were first come first serve. Â (They are not, but when the table next to us left at least 3 people interrupted us to ask if they were before someone else was seated.) Â I am still giving 4 stars as the salad and lasagna were excellent. Â The homemade pasta was so good. Â The desserts (tiramasu and gelatto) were also very good. Â <br><br>Unfortunately, no Chef Fabio in the house on this night:( Â I am giving 4 stars since they just opened and are maybe still working out some service issues. Â The waitress was attentive and nice, but I wish she would have explained more about what to expect with the food coming out. Â I also enjoyed all of the food, except for the mozzarella which was just ok. Â I will probably go back and try again in a few months.<br><br>On another note - I would very careful with the valet service. Â We parked in the garage across the street where they park customers cars and were almost rear ended by one. Â They were racing each other at high speeds up and down the ramps, honking, tail gaiting each other and almost hit us coming around a corner as we were stopped to let someone else out. Â It is the same price to park in the garage on the weekends as it is to valet.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Wonderful. Second visit; first on a Sunday afternoon tonight early dinner.

Â It took 6 weeks Â to get a 6:30 res on a Friday night and I called to try to push it back but they said no. Â Well, traffic was horrible and we didn't arrive until 7:00. Â They couldn't have been nicer and seated us right away without any comments on the time. Â The bar was hopping and the restaurant was busy but didn't seem packed, plenty of tables were open. Â The space is very nice, open and classy casual. Â Anyway, Casey was our server and she was great. Â ALways a treat to have a female server who recommends meat! Â She had great suggestions and we ordered tons of food......buffala mozzarella with tomato jam, pepperoni pizza, siena bread with evoo and cheese, beet salad, shaved brussel sprouts, gnocchi, pappardelle, carrot tortellaci, and the parmesan sage fries. Â Everything was delicious!! Â Only critique is that the staging was a little fast. Â In fact, we would have ordered another bottle of wine if the food had not all come out in 45 minutes.

Â You enter through revolving doors to be greeted by the host/hostess station constructed of shiny steel plate held together by rows of rivets. Â It looks like an homage to the Restoration Hardware catalog. Â The overall decor is industrial-chic with acres of concrete, gray leather and black granite and this upcycled hub-cap bar doesn't really fit. Â Turn left and you will be in the bar area, which is huge. Â On a Friday evening it was packed with twenty or thirty somethings plus those who wished they were. Â To the right is the eating area. Â This separation of the bar/food area is good design as it means you can actually talk to the people you are eating with, something that is rare in many restaurants. Â The tables by the window are set up for foursomes. Â The middle area is a line of semi-circular banquettes which are raised one step above the floor level. Â  They are actually very comfortable for twosomes, which is how they were being used, although I think they could accommodate four people. Â Nearer the kitchen there are high tops and then chairs against the bar. Â <br><br>The waitress was excellent. Â She went through the menu highlighting favorites in each category. Â I was impressed that she was not trying to push the priciest items. Â All the food is made in-house and even the herbs are grown on the wall behind the bar. Â The menu is extensive and includes small plates, a mozzarella bar, a crudo bar, home made pasta and pizza plus more traditional entree sized dishes. Â  The food came quickly and this restaurant was not being cheap on staffing levels. Â Bus boys were in evidence all the time. Â Water glasses were refilled and empty plates were promptly removed from the table. Â This was some of the best service I have had recently.<br><br>My friend was the Birthday Girl and, as she is a hundred percent Italian, I defer to her on the authenticity of the food. Â She was raving about it, saying the tomato sauce was just like her mother's. Â We shared the Kobe meatball, which was approaching the size of a tennis ball, and the bufala mozzarella with eggplant caponata. Â Toasted bread came with both of these dishes. Â I loved the eggplant caponata and wished there was more of it although, to be fair, it was just the supporting act to the mozzarella. Â These sharing dishes are pretty close to entree size. Â My friend then had gnocchi with a truffle cream sauce, which she loved. Â I had the black squid ink linguini with lobster which was very tasty. Â We definitely didn't need dessert, but ordered some anyway. Â I had a warm apple-fig tart with triple vanilla bean gelato. Â The tart case was very crisp and had obviously been baked unfilled. Â The apples had been sliced into ribbons and mixed with little squares of dried fig. Â The tart filling had been flavored with spices and tasted just like Christmas. Â I loved it. Â My friend wanted gelato, but asked if she could have the triple vanilla bean which was not one of the options listed. Â She was happy when the answer was yes because, as she said, many restaurants are like petty dictators and just refuse to deviate from the written menu.<br><br>We really enjoyed this restaurant and chose it because it was recommended by a friend.

We then ordered the coccoli appetizer which was really good. The prosciutto was really tasty, there was enough for each to have 1 piece. A few of us then wanted to try the cheese board so we chose the gorgonzola and red rock to try. The cheese came on a large rock like tray with 5 cube of the red rock and a piece of gorgonzola the size of a half of slice of cheese. It was accompanied by 5 walnuts, a quarter size dollop of a honey sauce and a quarter sized dollop of a tomato jam. This entire tray cost $14 and it was the sparsest cheese tray I had ever come across. The cheese was good but 3 people shared it getting what I would call a nibble.....not worth $7 per cheese. We then ordered the faro pasta, gnocchi, and the orechiette. We also ordered the margherita pizza. The pizza was a very good size and was tasty....definitely the best priced item on the menu for the portion size. The pastas were all very good but again lacking on the portions. Normally after have 2 appetizers and then ordering pasta, to go bags are needed, not here. Everyone cleared there plates because the appetizers were so minimal. We also all ordered drinks which were very good. Lastly, on our open table reservation that it was our friends birthday and when it came time for dessert they brought nothing. The birthday girl ordered the $5 gelato and when it arrived the waitress had a candle in hand and said \"it's your birthday right\" she then lit the candle and stuck it in the dessert....not the way we really wanted that to happen for our friends special day. The restaurant also charged us for the $5 dessert...not very good customer service if you ask me. Overall food tasted good but the portions were too small for the cost, the server was friendly and knowledgeable when she was around but she went missing a few times and the drinks were average for the area.

We had a vegan with us as well, and Tanner was so helpful in helping her pick things from the menu, or offering to create a dish that she would enjoy! Awesome! He went over all of his favorites from the menu and we ended up starting with the COCCOLI, OCTOPUS, MEATBALLS (which are huge), and I know there was something else, but I cant remember.

I've been to Italy several times and this restaurant exceeded my expectations since sometimes other top chef restaurants aren't so great...started off with the coccoli wow these literally melted in you mouth the truffle honey elevated the dish to an entire new level(I fell in live with truffles in Italy where they are in abundance), the prosciutto was high quality and the mozz melted in your mouth I highly recommend starting with this. We then split a truffle pizza and the gnocchi...the gnocchi hit he mark dead on true comfort food for a rainy day...the pizza was slightly underwhelming needed more flavor. Since is was my bday they brought a scoop of bday Icecream..at first sight I was disappointed but upon taste it was incredible pieces of cake in it---cleaned the bowl.

I tried to get a reservation the same day -- 5:30 on Friday night, and was told they were full, but we could sit at the bar or outside. My friend and I arrived at 5:15 and were able to sit outside. We had the best service from Kristy K. who was knowledgeable about the food and also made GREAT recommendations. She was not one of these aloof hipsters that many restaurants hire, but genuinely nice and interested in our experience and feedback. She recommended the coccoli, which was outstanding. I still think of it. The fresh, crispy dough with the prosciutto wrapped around stracchino cheese was a taste sensation. I shared the Burrata with my friend. While the burrata portion was large, and the quality amazingly fresh, it was featured with figs. When the figs arrived, they were a mere decoration on the plate. When a menu lists figs in August, it should not be pieces that look like part of a mise-en-place. There should be more fig. I had the fresh and tasty pasta in a jar, which sounded like a gimmick, but was really good. My friend had lasagna in the cutest little metal baker. The tippy top of the meal was the bombolini. Wow, another fried dough extravaganza. We started with the coccoli, with fried dough, and ended with bombolini. A tasty meal and a great experience. When my friend recommended Siena Tavern, I hadn't heard of it, so I looked up their website and saw their wonderful video. I had just arrived home from a vacation in Italy, so that video and the stated intention of the partners to create something that was authentically Italian with an American twist really caught my interest. The restaurant did not disappoint in execution from the expectations created in the video. Thank you.
