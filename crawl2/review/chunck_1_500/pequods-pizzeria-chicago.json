They also put an obnoxious amount of pepperoni on the pizza, some areas were 4 slices thick, making the pizza taste extremely heavy and salty.

The menu didn't list any of the ingredients in the salad so I didn't know what to expect. The salad contained old wilted lettuce, and had pepperoni and sliced cheese on top, making it basically a pizza except with crappy lettuce as the base instead of bread. The tomatoes were borderline rotten, they were bitter and brown inside. I also ordered a vinaigrette dressing, but received two sauce containers of olive oil and two sauce containers of balsamic vinegar; did they expect me to make my own dressing? Usually vinaigrette comes premixed with seasoning. The cheesy garlic bread was basically baguette sliced in half with a sliced of cheese on top.

So this time I wanted to know who had the best in town. During my research this place kept on popping up. I've already tried a lot of the other top rated places so wanted to go here. Food Network also rated it the second best pizza in the Nation! So I had to give it a try.<br><br>When I went I ordered a large pep and sausage pan (deep dish) w/ extra cheese. It came out in the normal deep dish cast iron pan. And you could tell just by looking at it what time of experience I was in for. It looked so good. When I finally started eating it I fell in love. No joke, it's that good. All the flavors go so well together. The sauce was perfect and everything came together. I love the darkened caramelized cheese ring around the edges. You won't really get that anywhere else and it's kind of a Peqouds \"thing\". This was my first deep dish with thick crust. But it was so good. It was cooked perfect. The pizza was steaming hot and I still couldn't even let it sit a second before taking more bites. I will say this I by far my favorite Deep Dish. Giordano's what? Lou Malnati's who?... never heard of em..... This is my go to spot in my favorite city now. No game or gimmicks, you gotta go if you never been. This pizza is LIT.<br><br>The place is very small. And I heard that it normally has lines around the corner. So I made sure to get here early before opening to get a spot. I'd suggest that for anyone that comes from out of town. The inside looks like a plain regular bar or pub. Which makes it even better. They don't have that corporate feel that the other places have. Their menu is basic, like super basic. And that just adds to the whole ambiance of this place. No flashing likes and smoke and mirrors. They are about their pizza, and that's what on show here.<br><br>The service was nice. Nothing too great. Just average. But that's fine. As long as it is not negative. Everything was on time and quick. We had our drinks refilled when we needed them and everything. <br><br>Overall this place has set the standard for Chicago deep dish for me. I was giving other pizza places high ratings. But not I gotta re think the whole thing. This place is a 10/10 and everything else falls under it. That's just #Facts. This is definitely my new go to when in the Windy City.

Princess Carewee was to my left, configuring her camera after a full day of adventure. Across from us is our mercurial friend, Kent24, fully wrapped in Giants attire. We were quiet. Battered from a long day of eating, drinking, baseball, and more eating, we had to travel by foot to this popular Pizza place. There was little energy left for idle conversations.<br><br>By contrast, the restaurant was loud and lively, even at this late hour. The walls were illuminated with neon lights of commercial beer logos and Chicago sports team. Against the dim lighting, the décor reminds one more of a sports bar than a pizzeria. But maybe the two are the same here in the Midwest. <br><br>The menu was a single laminated piece of literature. It dutifully reminded us that Pequod was famous for its caramelized crust, or its \"darkened edge\". Between the three of us, we had no idea how this would taste, but were in firm agreement that it must be awesome. The menu also listed out all the toppings that we can choose from. The usual suspects were all present: Spinach, Sausage, Mushroom, Extra Ch---<br><br>\"Extra Cheese.\" I broke our silence with a wide-eyed whisper. <br><br>Kent24 was not having it. Still feeling the effects of our hearty dinner not so many hours ago, the proposition of adding another layer of fat to an already heavy fourth-meal must have sounded ludicrous. But the thing you have to know about Kent24 is that it's never a 'hard no.' As a matter of fact, the 'No' is merely an invitation to strengthen the proposal of your idea - to describe the insanity, to explain the improbability, and to illustrate the grandeur of its effects. Kent24's 'No' is merely the demand that you verbalize the \"Lit-Ness\" that is your idea and immortalize the awesomeness in words.<br><br>\"Fine, get the extra cheese.\" Kent24 conceded, inevitably I may add.<br><br>Thus, I would not be doing our gluttonous gluttony justice if I do not chronicle our pizza experience to you as I have imagined it to Kent24 just moments before our glory.<br><br>The server arrived at our table with a circular pan. Sitting within the pan were the dear and familiar colors of a midnight pizza. The crimson red of the classic pepperoni and the radiant green of the bell peppers clashed violently against a wobbly backdrop of golden mozzarella. Fiery red tomato sauces burst through pockets of the melted surface and splattered on any and all nearby darkened sausages and olives. All the colors glistened under a thin layer of oil, accentuating this visual spectacle. Enclosed within the pan was chaos and beauty, and it was announcing its presence ever so loudly with its violent aroma. <br><br>My heart began racing. I knew Kent24's was too. After juggling our phones with our trembling hands, we had the cameras in position to capture this moment. Finally, a LITsperience worthy to share on our social media outlets, guaranteed to extract those coveted little hearts from our followers.<br><br>The server, standing by us this whole time, motioned politely for us to wait. He wore a slight smirk on his face and his brown eyes exude the type of confidence that we had only seen in a meme... he did not speak, but we heard him loud and clear.<br><br>\"This isn't even my final form.\"<br><br>The metal slicer clanged against the pan and in one swift motion, raised a slice of the pie into the night sky. The sight was majestic --- no, it was divine. In its ascent, small pieces of sausages separated from its body and fell gloriously from the skies. The streams of mozzarella stretched with the crust and into the gates of heaven. Each golden strand looked as if it were a celestial ray of light breaking through the clouds and onto Earth, blessing the taste buds of devout eaters.  <br><br>In truth, neither Kent24 nor I finished more than one slice of that pizza. As its appearance suggests, it was as heavy as it was filling. We were punished for our greed and gluttony as we had no microwave in our lodgings and had to watch more than half of our deep dish go to waste. But it was worth it. Pequod's Deep Dish was the most amazing piece of pizza I have ever witnessed and I will sin a hundred times to eat that forbidden pie again. <br><br>We left Pequod's with our bellies full of pizza and a night full of memories. The decision to go with extra cheese - against the better judgment of our appetite, diet, and/or health - was the right decision. Years from now, Kent24 and I will be throwing back some Coors Light (Kent went to Colorado ONCE) and we will remember this night in Chicago. We will reminisce about Wrigley, we will laugh about the LC, and we will talk about how we once saw a slice of deep dish pizza soared into the cosmos. LITness is forever.<br><br>SIDE STORY<br>As many of you may know, Princess Carewee is a plant based homie. Pequod was able to accommodate her with a no-cheese deep dish.

We were informed that the wait for pizza would be ~45 minutes; I think it ended up being a little less. We went for the medium deep dish with spinach and sausages. The pizza is so bread-y (in the words of my friend, it felt like \"90% bread\") that though the pizza didn't look large, it was massively filling. The fillings were generous (so much cheese, so much sauce, basically an entire layer of spinach and copious amounts of sausage) and very liquid-y, but the crust held up well to all that moisture. That being said, it was a fork-and-knife pizza experience.<br><br>Our favorite part of the pizza was the sausage, which had a prominent fennel flavor and a juicy bite. The cheese had that good stretchy pull, but was on the bland side, and we needed a good sprinkle of red pepper flakes to add some flavor.

Not, perhaps a \"real\" deep dish... but in a pan, with caramelized, delicious crusts, nice layer of cheese (if you're expecting a lot of cheese like on other deep dish pizzas filled half with tomato sauce and half with cheese, you should ask for an extra topping of cheese) and filled with fresh, yummy ingredients. <br><br>While searching for deep dish, I've been to the famed Lou Malnati's  and Giordanos but was never wowed. I thought it was just that I don't really like deep dish. It is too big, too soggy, too salty and too tomatoyee. Well, wether Pequod's is real deep dish or its fixed version, this is one pizza I like! It's definitely not NY style thin or Costco pizza (which I like, btw, but I wouldn't say they are better than Pequod's as some reviewer mentioned... at least personally, this here is definitely worth it), and also crusty and filled with yummy ingredients. I like that the tomato sauce is not overpowering. On this last visit, I thought they had skimped out on cheese though. The last several times I've been, the cheese was oozing out while the server was serving up the pizza, but this time, it definitely stayed in place, and I could taste it less. I hope it was just a temporary hiccup rather than a permanent cost saving tactic. <br><br>Their $4.95 lunch specials come with a personal size pizza and a drink. Some years ago, it was with a beer but that's changed to a fountain drink. I really like this personal size... Feels like more caramelized deliciousness. <br><br>We ordered a large pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms, onions and garlic, and they definitely loaded it up. We also shared the app combo. Glad we did, since we were hungry and the pizza takes 40 minutes to cook. Yes, either order ahead (I'm not sure you can, actually, but I should next time I go), or be ready to wait.

I believe you can also phone in advance to get \"priority seating\" (not a reservation) which is probably worthwhile if you're going at a peak time.<br><br>I reccomend ordering as soon as you sit down.

I had definitely done my homework about the wait times at Pequod's and filled out their priority seating form online. I'm not sure that this actually did much. They say that this is not a reservation, but you should get seated in about half the time if you were just to walk in. When we arrived, we were told that we would be seated in about 15-20 min. We ended up waiting about 45 min (after having to go to the hostess time 2 times to check on where we were)<br><br>One of my big issues with this place is the service. When our table was finally ready, the hostess pointed to a table in the corner and told us that that would be our table and that it just needed to be cleaned off. The entry way area is very tiny and cramped, so rather than crowd the hostess stand we just went and stood by the table that the hostess said was ours. Another waitress/hostess came over to clean the table off and asked if we were her 6-top. There were only four of us, but we replied that the hostess told us this would be our table. She was very rude and dismissive and said \"Well, there's been a change you need to go back to the hostess stand\" Keep in mind, we've already been waiting almost an hour and each time to get to the hostess there's a line. We finally get seated after another 5 min trying to get back up to the hostess and it takes almost 10 minutes for our waitress to even come over to our table. <br><br>As other reviews have said, the pizza's take quite awhile to make. They are very up front with this fact so it was not a surprise. Previous reviews have said they were able to place an order while they were waiting or call in an order.

Pequod's is not the lone survivor, that place starts with a \"G.\" Pequod's is just another hack \"pizza.\" I'll explain in greater detail for those of you wondering how this could be. Last Friday, late, my wife and I had a craving for pizza. Since our old favorites, which I won't indict here now, have become terrible, I decided to order my first Pequod's \"pizza.\" I was so excited after all the buzz I had heard over the years. I even told the order taker how excited I was to order from them for the first time. Well, after the bready thing arrived, and we inspected it, I realized I had been taken for a ride. The \"pizza\" was not pizza at all, but rather three quarters of an inch of extremely sugary bread, topped with an imperceptibly thin film of cheese. The toppings we ordered, garlic and spinach, were nonexistent. I did spot what looked like a tiny spinach leaf, but I cannot be sure it was indeed spinach. Neither my wife nor I were able to taste any garlic, and we are both lovers of garlic. Atop the barely noticeable cheese and nonexistent toppings was a fine layer of what tasted like sugar-laden canned spaghetti sauce. I cannot believe anyone would eat this stuff, it's awful. I paid 20 bucks for a half a loaf of lousy bread and a slice of cheese with some smeared on spaghetti sauce. If this alleged \"pizza\" was good at one time, that's in the past, and I can assure you, it is not worth trying. We also ordered salads and soup, which was fair at best, and certainly the highlight of the order. I will never order from Pequod's again, once was more than enough. I wish I could give a negative rating, or a zero, because that would be an accurate score, so I will do it here: minus 3 rating for Pequod's. Absolutely terrible.

We ended up sending the salad back because most of the lettuce was turning brown around the edges.

Perfect for two light eaters who wanted no leftovers. The pizza was tasty. The toppings were all in good quantities and had great flavor and aesthetics. The crust was disappointing. Somehow, they have a pan crust (risen, airy) but the bottom is still sort of crumbly in texture (imagine crumbly fried biscuit on the bottom and airy pan crust in the middle). While the bottom and sides was nicely browned/charred, the middle tasted doughy/yeasty, like a dough that was cooked on the bottom but a little raw in the center.<br><br>*The very best aspect of the pizza is the crispy edges formed by caramelized cheese welded to the crunchy exterior crust. I could eat this crust all. day. long.<br><br>*It's sort of a weird pizza. I feel like you have to eat 75% of an okay pizza to get to the 25% of the best darn thing you'll put in your face all day.<br><br>Service:<br>*It's not great. Everyone was friendly and prompt when we first arrived, but then our server just sort of left us alone in a bad way. As I mentioned earlier, we had to send back our appetizer salad, but we sent it back with the cook that brought our pizza. The server never came back after our salad arrived to check on us.

Of course if you get a lot more toppings on your pizza that can go up quickly, but I was highly satisfied with the value of our order.<br><br>Overall:<br>Pequod's was on my Chicago pizza bucket list, but it's far from my favorite in the city.

For me, it was those caramelized burnt ends!! People don't like their ''cornicione''. But I found myself eating them, non-stop. My criticism is they pour a lot of sauce into the pizza. So when you're working on it, the sauce will burst all over your face and most importantly your beard. <br><br>Thanks to some awesome Chicagoan friends, I was invited to a small event over here. We were about 20 people. Michelle, the organizer, pre-ordered lots of pizzas. To be safe, I ordered a small thin crust cheese pizza, because I'm a part time vegan. Michelle said it was the best among all pizzas ordered!! I really liked it. The cheese amount was a generous Midwestern portion by default. I would've loved more crunch on the base. But you know how it is. The flavors were there, 4.2989899 stars. <br><br>The waitresses were efficient but you can feel they were pressurized as it was so busy and crowded. The place is old and dim from inside. But who cares if you have a fancy photographer friend like Daniel to make photos look amazing!.

Pequod's is not located in the touristy area of Chicago so I ended up having to catch an Uber here. Not wanting to wait a long time, my friend and I decided to stop by around opening time @ 11. We were quickly seated upstairs upon arrival. Our waitress was very friendly and was very attentive the whole time we were there. <br><br>I opted for the personal pan pizza with green peppers, sausage, olive, and mushrooms. Keep in mind that toppings are not free of charge so it can quickly add up. The pizza came out within 10 minutes piping hot. It's worth mentioning that their personal pizza's don't come in the skillet. The thing that stood out to me most about the pizza at Pequod's was definitely the crust and the tomato sauce. The tomato sauce tasted very fresh and the crush was not too overwhelming. The toppings I opted for were not overcooked and paired well with the pizza. At the end of my meal I was glad that I was able to try out a Chicago deep dish pizza and throughly enjoyed it.<br><br>Overall I had a positive experience from food to service at Pequod's. If I were to be 100% honest though I personally prefer NY pizza compared with the Chicago deep dish. The deep dish got a bit tiring for me near the end of my meal.

We showed up on a Monday right when they opened at 11AM and were seated right away in an empty (and dark) dining area. We each got an individual pizza (7\") which was a cheap $4.95 with the purchase of a soft drink for their lunch special.

So we each got one of those. <br><br>The pizza took 40 minutes to cook, even despite being one of the first few customers in the restaurant. Not sure if that's the usual length of time it takes to cook the pizza or if the wait gets worse the busier the place. When it came out, it was un-applaudingly small and served in the original deep dish pan. Had a very dark, borderline-burnt crust which I assumed was melted cheese held under the broiler. You could get four \"slices\" out of that one individual size. <br><br>The taste of the pizza itself: too saucy, not enough cheese, few chunks of sausage, and the crust was essentially like a plain dry-fluffy foccacia bread. You could say I was disappointed, as the only reference of deep dish I had previously was Uno's Chicago grill pizza which I have to say tastes better than this, though their tomato sauce is a little too sweet.

Lou Malnati's would come second best with a 3/5, and if there were half stars, Pequod's a 3.5/5. <br><br>I was starving by the time I got to Pequod's, and everything tastes better when you're hungry. For appetizers, four of us split the combo which came with zucchini slices, mozzarella sticks, jalapeno poppers, breaded shrooms (not the drug kind), and onion rings. they were okay- the veggies were pretty juicy, the batter was crispy, and the dipping sauce paired well, but it's nothing memorable. and again, I don't think they would've tasted as \"good\" if I hadn't been so damn hungry (I'd give it 3.5/5).<br><br>We split a large pan pizza with pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, and green peppers. The reason why I rank this place above the two others is because the whole pizza actually had some flavor and the crust was nice and buttery-tasting compared to Lou Malnati's and Giordano's which I thought both fell flat in terms of just being tasteful- I don't know what they lack, salt? butter? the sauce doesn't have enough spices? the dough just tastes like bland dough? not sure but what they lacked in their deep dish, Pequod's made up for it a bit better, and the browned cheese was delish. I'd still give a 3.5 to Pequod's deep dish pizza though, cause it came out mostly burnt on the sides (don't eat burnt stuff yo, it's cancerous) and deep dish just leaves me way too full to feel good about myself.

You still need to wait a bit (kind of like a FastPass system at Disneyland). Luckily, there are some cool bars around the immediate area. My wife and I ended up going to Kibbitznest across the street for a warm drink. Pequods buzzed us about 30 minutes later.<br><br>The pizza is amazing! Since it takes awhile for the pizza to be ready (they were insanely packed), we ordered some chicken wings as appetizers. They were delicious. Our pizza came out about 20 minutes later, and wow. My mouth is watering just thinking about that beautiful pie. They do not mess around with toppings (we got 5, and our pizza was overflowing). The crust is cooked to perfection: Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. It was a glorious meal and I wish there was a Pequod's Pizzeria everywhere.<br><br>Service was great, location is a bit away from downtown Chicago, and ambiance is cool. My suggestion for any first timers is to not get so many toppings on one pizza. Like I said: They do not skimp on the toppings. Two toppings would be more than enough, maybe three.

I was taken there by a friend native to Chicago against my will and I was craving something more unique afterwards. That's when I went to Pequod's Pizza. <br><br>You walk inside Pequod's and you aren't greeted with the best customer service (still, the staff is pleasant) or the best atmosphere around; but you're greeted with absolutely amazing food. That's why you come here-- for the pizza. Pequod's does things a bit differently. The crust of the pizza is carmelized and has a fantastic crunch to the initial bite. The ingredients from the cheese to the meats and veggies all taste and look fresh. As with any deep-dish spot, there is the dreaded ~40 minute wait for your pizza to cook. However, Pequod's throws you a bone and offers you a free coffee, hot chocolate, or soda at the Whale Tale just steps away from the restaurant. Still, I recommend sharing a few appetizers and crisp beers to help make the wait easier.<br><br>What I tried & liked:<br><br>Small Deep-Dish Pizza: I topped my pizza with chicken and jalapenos and couldn't be happier. Naturally, deep-dish is extremely heavy and it's tough to get past a couple of slices (a good problem to have). But never would I imagine that the carmelized crust makes this pizza SO much better than the competition. Baking the pies in the seasoned cast-iron pans with cheese really adds a second element to the pizza missing from major chains.<br><br>Things I tried & disliked:<br><br>Cheesy Garlic Bread - It's your run-of-the-mill garlic bread topped with cheese. It wasn't particularly delicious and felt more like garlic bread I should receive at a dive bar. I'd recommend trying another appetizer like mozzarella sticks or onion rings-- those are difficult to get wrong.<br><br>Pequod's is not in downtown-- in fact, it can be inconvenient to get here and have to head all the way back to the city. But there's a good reason why Pequod's has such a strong following, even more than that of its mainstream rivals.

But this is where everything falls apart, pie looked fantastic when it landed on the table haven't seen anything like it before, saucey, cheesy, carmalizied edges, in your face ingredients, but what counts the most is the final follow through...The taste buds approval!...Which was a upset!  Crust, dry & thick, no flavor.  Sauce, no flavor, like tomato sauce from the can.  The carmalizied crust, nothing to cheer for, burnt cheese tastes better.  Overall, it's like eating a pizza on toasted Italian bread.<br>Final thoughts...over hyped and nothing to cheer for.  I've been Chicago since age 7, and tasted it all, and this place should be at the bottom with nothing to cheer about....Just my opinion, there's a lot better spots out there that aren't hyped that you should check out before coming here...", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This place has GREAT food!

Just the right spiciness to savor the flavor and enjoy them. We ordered a medium thin crust and a personal deep dish. The thin crust is not very thin, almost had the \"regular\" hand tossed thickness to it, but very flavorful. If you're a fan of pepperoni the way we are, get extra of it. The top layer is nicely charred and crispy with tons of flavor. The deep dish crust is also nicely charred and crispy and gives the pizza that extra flavor to satisfy your taste buds. This place is known for their deep dish and I could see why...the mixture of that sauce with the cheese and pepperoni was superb!

The crust is what everyone talks about though, so on to that. It's more pillowy than Giordano's, which is good in its own right. G's is a crisper, more buttery crust and is LOADED with toppings. P's definitely privileges the crust experience as they sprinkle it with cheese on the outside which forms a crunchy, crusty exterior.

The server then informed us that by the way, the wait for pizza right now is 90 minutes. <br><br>I absolutely believe that this needs to be told to guests as soon as they put their name down to wait for a table. They do have a laminated piece of paper up front saying \"the current wait for pizza is __\" but it said 40 minutes both times I was there, which was overestimated on my first visit and way underestimated on my second.<br><br>So all in all, if we had waited for a pizza (we didn't - we left), we would have been waiting a total of 2.5 hours to eat.

I don't want slightly charred pizza at all. Maybe I'm being a snob about this since I come from NYC and we are all about the pizza (albeit thin crust or \"regular\").

I like onions...but I don't know anyone who likes them this much. I mean they were under the cheese, in the cheese & then for the piece de resistance, on top of the cheese. It looked like someone loaded a tee shirt cannon with onions and shot it on the pizza dead center. As for the meatballs (which should have been the star) it looked like someone took ah(uno/one) meatball chopped it into millionths and then placed the meatball dust on the pizza. The crust was thick and soooper dry. It sapped all the moisture out of my mouth like a 3ply industrial paper towel once it hit my tongue. The abundance of sauce should have helped the crust situation but again if you recall it was flavorless & tasted tinny. It tasted almost as though the sauce went from can to pizza. <br><br>This all made for a terrible Friday pizza night.

You honestly treated us differently because we kept seeing people behind us were seated. <br><br>Second, after almost 3 hour wait, you give us the table for 4 people. We are group of 5. We seated - very uncomfortable and crowded. We saw the table behind us - which can fit 5 people, we politely asked the waitress - can we switch to that table? Because they are done. The waitress says that she has to ask the front. Shortly she came back and said to us that - that 5 people table need to give for group of more people. Excuse me? We saw 5 people just sitting there and they left. And you told us that table need to wait for more than 5 people?

Service was top notch from the moment we stepped in until we left. Our waitress was friendly and peppy and explained the menu, jumping us right to the page with the deep dish (she knew) and explaining how many servings/pieces each size of pizza was (whether you would have leftovers or not). She also indicated the 'wait time' as some are calling it or how long it takes them to make you an amazing pizza. Geez, people. We opted for the small pan pizza with pepperoni, jalapeño and Italian sausage and an order of cheese bread with homemade, I repeat HOMEMADE marinara. The marinara was amazing and the bread was also pretty great and came out quick after our order was taken. The wait for the pizza was probably less than what was quoted to us.  The pizza--came served hot, oh so delicious and flavorful. We loved the burnt, crisp crust, a different spin on deep dish. The Italian sausages were ginormous and it was stacked with pepperoni (worth that extra charge per topping). I was only sad that I couldn't finish my pizza in one sitting. And, prices were so reasonable-our bill was under $30. We also had Gino's on this trip, and while a classic staple of Chicago, it didn't compare to the food quality received at Pequod's.

After 20 minutes we went back to find out how much longer because if it was going to be 20-30+ more we were going to go next door and have some drinks to pass time. They told us 10 minutes. Finally at 20 minutes we asked again and they already had us marked off even though our pager never went off and we had moved from outside, to inside the door because it was windy. They were able to get us seated promptly.  We ordered drinks. I ordered a gin martini, and yes I know its a pizza place so i wont complain that it wasn't great, thats on me. The beers I had to follow were cold. The salad we ordered was fresh and the dressing was really great. The appetizer combo was good (fried zucchini was my favorite) Then...our pizza. The cheese crust beautiful thing I had been waiting for since I saw it on tv some time ago. The gentleman that brought it out was courteous and asked if he could serve the first slice and we accepted. The pizza looked great. It just didn't taste as great as I thought it would.

The pizza was perfect deep dish - the crust was crunchy, the cheese was layered and thick, and the toppings all blended together nicely.<br><br>One of the downsides of deep dish, I feel, is that it's not nearly as good when delivered, because of how thick the pizza is. The pizza gets soggy quickly, and towards the end of the meal I already started to feel the cheese start to be more solid and not as tasty. The trade off is that deep dish, when eaten fresh, is incredibly rich and full of flavors.<br><br>There are different schools of thought as to whether or not deep dish is \"real pizza\" - some say that pizzas are meant to be more flat and meant to be a nice balance of 50% crust and 50% toppings, whereas others would say pizza is pizza as long as the ingredients are there.

Additionally they told us that we would only be able to order the appetizers available at Whale's Tale as well, and not from Pequod's, which wasn't an issue for us as we didn't get any appetizers. I'm not sure exactly how the relationship between the two establishments functions, but it worked out to our benefit as we were seated immediately, were able to place our orders as quickly as possible, and were served the pizza in only 25 or so minutes.

I LOVE the \"carmelized\" crust on their deep dish, which is essentially just some slightly burnt cheese. It adds a nice crunchiness to the crust and actually doesn't have too much of that acrid flavor associated with burnt cheese - it does have a small amount of it, but just the right amount. The bread was so soft and fluffy - I was surprised how much bread there actually was in each bite. Initially I thought there was too much, but as I kept on eating I began to enjoy the fact that there was so much of it. It really helped to hold each bite together, and there was so much flavor in the toppings, sauce, and cheese, that I didn't feel like the bread was excessively drowning out and diluting the flavor of any of the other components in the pizza. Again awesome AWESOME deep dish.<br><br>Overall an amazing deep dish experience.

Sure, ambiance-wise, it's a Blackhawks bar, but the pizza is the star of the show. Their pizza is, like I said before, deep-ish dish. I usually describe it as like a halfway deep dish. Pizzas are made in cast iron skillets and there is a layer of cheese baked in underneath and around the crust giving it a perfect, crunchy, parmesan seasoning all the way around. To me that is the best part. Pizza topping selections are plentiful, and they are not shy about loading them up onto the pizza. <br><br>I've never had a bad experience here, but there was only one time that I was here that I didn't have to wait less than an hour for a table (I think it was the middle of the afternoon for some reason). <br><br>I can not recommend this pizza enough.

I just recently visited with great enthusiasm to eat Chicago Deep Dish at this location, but I left very saddened and dissatisfied with my experience. <br><br>My main complaint is in regards to the timeliness and service. I had just arrived home from a long road trip and was excited to eat at a former favorite Chicago establishment. <br><br>I visited on a Sunday evening around 7pm. When I arrived, I was greeted and told there would be a half hour wait, which I was ok with, expected, and accepted the pager to await to be seated. About 20 minutes had passed and I noticed a couple of parties that came in after me we're being seated before me. I waited a few more minutes and then approached the hostess to see where I was in line as I was concerned that I may have been overlooked. The hostess was quick to notice that she could not find my pager number on the list, despite having a pager number assigned. She apologized and said she would have me seated next. I was quickly assigned a table and as the other host was directing me to it, she explained that my pager had been called as indicated by the circle marking on the device, but didn't understand why it didn't go off to alert me that my table was ready. Again, the hostess apologized and said it was good that I mentioned something otherwise I could have continued to wait unknowingly as they proceeded to go through the waitlist disregarding my assigned pager number.<br><br>My server came and took my drink and pizza order shortly after. I ordered a Small Deep Dish pizza and having been here before and aware of the signage regarding cooking and wait times for a deep dish, the wait began. There were a couple of parties across from me who just received their pizzas when I ordered, they ate and left as I waited. I also noted that I was watching the end of the 4th quarter of an NBA Playoff Game and started to watch the following playoff game close to Half Time.<br><br>Basically I waited quite a while as the tables across from me had new parties seated and waiting whose pizza orders, one of which was a Large Deep Dish came out and was served at the same time as my Small Deep Dish was served. I expressed my concern to my server regarding the wait time, who seemed somewhat agitated that the wait time was an issue to me, explaining the cooking time can take up to 50 minutes. I could have mentioned, that was the only time I was checked on since I had placed my order and I explained that I was not arguing or complaining, just voicing my concerns regarding the obvious situation regarding the timeliness. My server said she would have a manager come by though I did not ask. I was already feeling miserable about the whole experience that honestly I just wanted to pay and leave. (Of note, I noticed the servers were using hand held pads for ordering and charging which I am sure could easily time stamp the events as they were placed.)<br><br>A manager came over and apologized saying that he understood the situation, explained that it was busy, and  it just happened that all the pizza orders came out at the same time. I was offered 25% off my bill, which I honestly did not care to account for as a new server came by to check on me and who I asked to have my pizza boxed, that I just wanted to close out and pay.<br><br>As a Chicagoan who has lived here for some time and has had positive memories of this place before, I will no longer return nor recommend this place to residents or visitors alike.

Possibly, but it is definitely not worth the wait and with so many options for a good Chicago Deep Dish, there are a number of better pizza places in this great city.<br><br>I understand this review may not be significant to anyone that could go through the thousands of positive reviews, but for anyone that does happen to read through this, I hope you have a better experience if you decide to eat here.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Not much else to say other than the food here is awesome.   The parking is a little off, but the food definitely made up for this.  My wife and I will be back sooner rather than later.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I'll start by saying: I'm not a fan of deep dish.  However, if I was in the rare mood for a bit, I'd say Pequods is amazing.

It was a big slice and not bad, but I prefer my thin crust even crunchier (think New York-style pizza, and yes, I realize that I shouldn't be expecting that while in Chicago). <br><br>All of the deep dishes start off with just cheese and you customize your pie from that point after picking a size. Each additional topping costs extra, and the cost of each topping depends on the diameter of your pizza. You can also order half-toppings (I think it means it is only put on half of your pizza) and premium toppings. <br><br>The deep dish was decent, but not particularly memorable in my opinion.

My family and I came to the restaurant back in July because a lot of people we spoke to recommended Pequods over Giordano's and Lou Malnati's, let's just say they couldn't be more wrong. The experience from start to finish was one of the worst I've ever had at any restaurant. We waited over 3 hours for a table of 10. At first I didn't mind the wait because we were a large party but by the time it was 12am and we were still waiting it was kind of insane. When they finally called our table we were seated upstairs and while walking upstairs we noticed the entire restaurant was empty. I think maybe one or two parties were left but there were so many tables available i couldn't believe they took so long to seat us. By the time they seated us we put in our order right away and then waited another hour for the pizza, for 4 pies of pizza! At that point we had been waiting for 4 hours, 3 hours to sit then another hour to eat. It was 1230am and I decided to ask one of the waitresses why the pizza was taking so long, she looked up at me and said \"don't you see I'm folding boxes, I'm busy, I can't help you.\" I understand she wasn't our waitress but it wouldn't have been so hard to say \"sorry if you give me one second I'll grab your server and she can help you.\" Anyways, to top it all off, when our pizza finally did come it was the most mediocre of pizzas I've ever had. There was no cheese, the entire pizza was just dough, I wouldn't call it a deep dish or actually a pizza really.<br><br>I wouldn't waste time coming to any of their locations.

I had high expectations for my first time when I went to Pequod's, and they definitely were met and exceeded! I was not disappointed. If you go on a weekend, you should expect a wait, unless you utilize the call ahead seating that they offer. The pizza does take some time to make, but it is expected.

My favorite pizza in the city. However, delivery is not what it uses to be. I initially called at 6:10pm today to place an order. I followed the prompts and was on hold listening to some awful music for 20 min. 20 minutes. Unreal. Then the music stops, and I get pushed to voicemail! The fact I even stayed on hold that long showcases how much I love this pizza. I call back and decide to choose the pick up prompt, which resulted in me speaking to someone right away. I advised what happened and instead of saying they will look into it, she said she could take my order herself. Had I known this I wouldn't have waited for 20 minutes.<br><br>Now the fun part. I got my order taken, was told it would be here in about 1.5 hours (8:05pm). Pizza didn't come until 8:30. That is 2 hours of waiting. That's a bit ridiculous in my opinion. I'm not that far away, there was no rain, and traffic around 8pm isn't really heavy. I ended up calling the store asking if anything had happened because it's been 2 hours. The girl who answered said to call back in 10 minutes if the pizza didn't come. I mean, shouldn't this be addressed at that moment in time, regardless? What is 10 minutes after 2 hours of waiting?!?!? Customer service should have been better. I should have been given to a manager to discuss. Had I known I'd be eating at 8:30pm I would have ordered somewhere else, eaten by 730pm (at a normal hour).<br><br>Pizza came lukewarm, not hot. Normally, I would say something, but I was so hungry from not having had anything to eat all day that I just said forget it. They won't do anything anyways- they didn't do anything when I told them I've been waiting over 2 hours and the pizza guy was 30 min late. For the price, I would have expected a little better customer service. I order pizza all the time and come in very frequently, so this experience makes me a little weary of ordering delivery from here.

I had a Italian sausage, with sweet peppers.

I know this is a pizza place first but come on if you mess up a simple sandwich how good can the pizza be? I mean seriously. My guess this place is frequented by people right out of college that were eating Dominos pizza for the past 5 years in college. The older group probably ate there years ago wandered in and realized the pizza wasn't as good as they thought. My guess is that if any of you 4 star reviewers took a tour of that kitchen you'd drive straight to Cosco to buy a pallet of toilet paper cause you'll surely need it..

The deep dish was exactly what I expected. Even though I'm not a deep dish person, I ate two pieces and had to stop myself from having a third lest I leave no room for the thin crust. The thin crust was excellent, and the thickness was deceiving: it was crisp and delicious even though a bit airy.

If you look at the menu, they call this \"pan\" pizza and I'm glad they do, because I'd consider them the best pan pizza in Chicago, not deep dish. What I'm trying to say is pan pizza is known to be over-compensated on the dough. This is a very doughy pizza. I consider deep dish more balanced with more cheese and toppings and less dough. To each their own. I really like the airiness of the crust. It has a well-cooked bottom crunch, yet a chewy center. The sauce is more savory and is a true sauce, not chunk tomatoes. I hate to say it, but the sausage tasted a little dry and gritty. This is more than likely due to it being cooked on top of the pizza. There was a decent amount of cheese. It was enough, but wouldn't have complained if there was more. Of course I have to mention the caramelized cheese crust. This is the best bite of the pizza and what they are famous for. Don't be alarmed, it does not taste burnt at all! I also got a thin crust pizza. It's nice that they do a braided outer crust.

They're \"famous\" for their carmelized crust, which is really just burnt cheese around the edges. You will wait a very long time to eat it (45 mins from the time you order, that's not counting waiting for your table). You will be tempted to order a salad, because waiting 45 mins to put food in your mouth seems unbearable. The salad will be the saddest excuse for a salad you've seen, a complete waste of stomach space, but you'll be somewhat happy to not be starving anymore. Your pizza will finally arrive almost an hour later, and you will inevitably think it's the best pizza known to man, mainly because your stomach is half-full of sad romaine. But this! This is hot & cheesy and bready. Your rational brain may kick in and remind you: this is merely cheese & sauce on a thick piece of dough -- don't get so excited. Ok, ok, the edges are crispy, and that part is incredible, you wish you could eat a whole pizza made of the edges. You will then wonder: did I just order this monstrous pizza just to eat its edges? Perhaps. Perhaps you did. But that's what people do in Chicago, so there must be something to it. <br><br>If that didn't help you make your decision, I'll just add: this pizza may not change your life, but it will fill your belly, and sometimes that's good enough. You'll also experience an authentic, bustling, pizza parlor vibe that doesn't feel touristy (except for all the people who are clearly tourists). The beer selection is pretty basic. The servers are all in a hurry, but remain nice enough. And those salads - please don't. <br><br>There are lots of places in Chicago and beyond that make a tasty deep dish.

About 20 minutes later, the salad arrived. After waiting that long for a salad, it should have arrived in a bowl that had just been woven by master craftsmen. It didn't. It was a small salad, enough for 2 to share if your not very hungry. The dressing was very good. Nice taste of Parmesan. <br><br>We waited just under an hour for our 2 personal pizzas.

Our waitress was nice but I have to say the service was extremely disappointing. It took forever just to get a drink and our appetizer came out and was the wrong thing. A few tables around us also received wrong orders. We shared the house salad with ranch, and the dressing was really tasty. The wings, once we got the correct ones, were pretty crispy and had a nice BBQ sauce.<br><br>Our pizza ended up taking almost an hour and a half to get to us and by this point we were starving even after apps. It was very cheesy and had good flavor. I like their sauce, it's not too sweet or too tangy. We did half with sausage and onion and half with cheese. I definitely prefer the side with toppings-- it offsets how thick the crust is. Eventually our area started to get really crowded and there was a big group of drunk people that snuck past the host and were trying to order pizza without waiting. The waitstaff just kind of let it happen, which was frustrating because it caused us to have to wait a really long time to get our check and leave.<br><br>Overall I think the pizza is good, and I don't mind eating it, but I don't find it special.

Disappointing.<br>But this review is solely for the \"thin-crust\" pizza.<br><br>I feel like I'm the only Chicagoan (or visitor of any kind) who has something bad to say but I have to say it for anyone who, like me, actually don't like thick pizzas. Sorry, Chicago, but I love me some NY-style pizza. It's the real thing. :P<br><br>I was with friends who wanted to try the place and thought I'd have a great experience like the many other patrons.<br><br>However, I guess my first mistake was getting the thin-crust, which is not what they're known for. As I am not a fan of other pizzas, I thought this would be my best bet. For the three of us, the pizzas took 45 minutes.<br><br>As soon as my pizza arrived, I was disappointed. It was not thin-crust at all. The outer edge where you hold it was really very cushiony, and the rest was just normal thickness. I knew I wouldn't find NY-style but Pequod's definition of thin-crust is way off.<br><br>But that wasn't really what bothered me. The flavor was just not there. There was nothing about the crust that tasted good (my friends who got pan pizzas said their crust was amazing, so I was envious!). It was really just like plain white bread. The cheese literally sat on the pizza in one sad, rubbery clump, not integrated with any of the vegetables I had selected (they tasted fine but were completely unseasoned). I could only stomach two slices as I was hungry before I just felt like I was eating cheap white bread with plasticy/fake white cheese. Honestly, I've had way better pizzas at Giordanos if you want to talk hyped-up places. Even Blaze Pizza, a franchise, turned out better. Not to mention Dimo's in Wrigleyville which has fantastic pizza. And, crust aside, they win when it comes solely to flavor.<br><br>My friends were happy with their pan pizzas, though. But if you only like NY-style pizza as I do, don't go even if your friends are raving about it. Let them experience it without you unless you're willing to go for the pan pizza (like I said, I can't speak to it, but I hear it's good and my friends who tried mine agreed it was pretty lame).

So my husband  and I were super excited to try some really good authentic Chicago pan pizza. We ordered the cheese with mushrooms onions and olives. Visually, the pizza looked kind of dull and grayish all over, which I do not know why since all the veggies are supposed to make it look colorful. <br><br>TASTE: SO BLAND and BARELY ANY CHEESE !!!!! I felt like I was eating a fat piece of bread with veggies on it. The bread to cheese ratio is so off. I hate pizza that does not have enough cheese that's the fun part ! Eating the gooey cheese with a good amount of sauce and a nice balanced crust. But anyways, this is what killed it for me. Pizza Hut has more flavor than this place sadly to say. <br><br>CRUST: The ONLY good part was the outer burnt edges of the pan pizza. The pan dough that the pizza is baked on however, was so bland and nothing special. <br><br>COST: What also was annoying is the fact that they charge $2 which so much for each topping and they have no options to choose from, only cheese and you pick whatever toppings you want. They already charge $16 for a medium which is way overpriced anyways. For such a tiny hole in the wall they charge so much. The place definitely does not reflect the quality or taste of the pizza. <br><br>Overall Review: DO NOT get fooled by the massive amount of reviews.

We got a pretty standard sausage, mushroom, peppers and basil, They really piled on the toppings and the sausage chunks were huge and looked home made. <br><br>The first bite was delicious until I got to the uncooked dough, a nice layer right beneath the cheese and right above the rest of the cooked crust that was still mushy and raw. Well it was in the center of the pizza so maybe it was just that part. 2nd bite, uncooked. 3rd bite, uncooked. 4th bite, uncooked. It was at this point that we asked our waitress to return the pizza to the oven to cook more and she was kind to oblige. 5 minutes later (for a total of 30 minutes oven time), our pizza came back piping hot. But that layer of uncooked dough was still there. <br><br>Yes, the caramelized crust (read: burnt cheese) is delicious, but the sauce and the rest of the pizza are nothing to write home about.

My wife and I wanted to experience the Chicago Deep Dish pizza and found this place to be well loved by the Yelp community. First of all, if you are relying on public transportation, be willing to go on a mini hike across the LePaul campus to get to this little gem. We came here on a weekday, just barely making it to the lunch specials, which was a personal 7\" cheese pizza for less than $5. That is freaking amazing! Of course, we splurged a little bit more, added numerous toppings, and got a small side salad for $2 and a local, honey infused root beer. Alright, I wasn't a big fan of the salad or the root beer, but it wasn't that bad either. You can see from the menu that Pequod makes each pizza individually, with a minimum wait of 30 minutes to accommodate for the toppings. I initially thought we'd be safe from that wait time since the restaurant was fairly empty (which is unusual, based on the reviews), but I guess the wait time is unique to a deep dish pizza. MY biggest disappointment, aside from the pizza being salty, was that it was served on a regular plate, instead of a deep dish. Ok, so 7\" pizza may not have needed it, but it would have given an unique illusion of a deep dish pizza. We eagerly scarfed down the pizza and found it to be perfect sufficient for the two of us. Unfortunately, I got incredibly nauseous a few hours after lunch, so I had to dock a point for that. <br><br>Food: 3 stars<br>Price: 4 stars<br>Ambiance: 3 stars<br>Service: 3.5 stars.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I think this is actually a long-running Punk'd type thing, where they must be filming people waiting forever and then pretending to like the worst pizza I've ever had (worse than Papa Johns).  <br>Yeah the crust gets caramelized into whatever is stuck on the bottom of your oven.  You can eat that with no wait, just grab a spatula and get at your oven!!<br>I do not get the hype.  Giordano's for life.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Extremely underwhelming.

It's appropriately filled up 4 people, and compared to the other major pizza spots around town it was actually a little bit cheaper(large pizza w/2 toppings $24.65). The first bites were actually pretty amazing; the cheese by then was still very gooey and, being a pan pizza, the crust was crisp but also incredibly fluffy. It's not like the buttercrust at Lou's where you have something of a more pot-pie consistency, this is straight up large pan pizza. Also, was a little skeptical about the caramelized cheese crust at first, but after trying it I'm a fan. Not as incredibly amazing as most people say it is(I mean, at that point you can't really even taste that it's cheese), but the texture is great and I think I'd prefer it to other deep dish pizzas in that regard(after all, you're still getting plenty of the thicky doughy goodness on the base of the pizza...no need to have more on the sides). The pepperoni were nothing special, and would opt for the sausage next time.<br><br>One dangerous downside...after initially amazing first few slices, once it cools down a little bit you actually realize how much of it is actually dough compared to filling. Whereas with say giordano's you really have a ton of sauce and toppings and the pizza dough is maybe 1/3 the width of the entire pizza, here it's the opposite; the dough actually accounts for like 75% of the height. Once it cools down this becomes very apparent, as you notice the thin layer of cheese and toppings compared to the dough. That said it's all super fluffy so it doesn't feel as if there is that ratio upon eating it, but it does take its toll after a while.<br><br>So final deep dish verdict? Actually a fan, and would say this hits the right price point too.

I am a professional in the hospitality industry and I am appalled at the response by the management at Pequod's. You expect your customers to not only pay you for a product, but then do the extra work of chasing you down to make sure they receive it?

You will be unsatisfied if you compare Pequods to other pizza you've had because of the difference in the category. Also, be careful reading any reads on Yelp -- always see where they're from! Most people giving low reviews to Pequods are out of towners and have not had Pequods or any deep dish pizza place more than once. If you compare it on it's merit to other Pizza, you'll be disappointed because there is no proper comparison (apples to oranges, both are fruit, but quite different.)  <br><br>The one thing that Pequods has over it's closely competitor is the amazing crust.

Generally, a large can feed a group of five or more!<br><br>My only advice is to actually request more sauce. On lazy days, the pizza may come out too dry and a dry pizza is no good. More sauce gives it more of a hearty tomato taste that really balances out the superior Pequods crust.  Otherwise, pick your favorite toppings (Note: pepperoncini is not pepperonis, don't learn the hard way). <br><br>Overall, the place is good for groups EXCEPT on any game day which will inflate your wait for both the pizza and a table. I wouldn't necessarily suggest bringing a family here either especially with younger kids or older adults because it has a very bar-y feel to the restaurant. Otherwise, it's a great place for friends (esp. those visiting from out of town to convert to Chicago pizza believers).", "pics": null}}]}
