If you've ever been to Tortas Frontera, Xoco is basically like a more upscale version of it, and with enhanced flavors. The dining area is relatively small, but we were fortunate enough to get our order in and get seated right away. <br><br>My wife ordered their Milanesa torta. For those of you who don't know what \"milanesa\" is, it's basically like a Mexican version of a breaded steak sandwich from Ricobenes but without the gravy and this one is chicken beef. Not only did this torta look beautiful, it tasted delicious. The bread had a perfect crunch to it and went well with the chicken, black beans and red onions. I ordered their Goat Barbacoa torta. I personally enjoyed this one more than their milanesa. A braised goat, with avocado, onions and cilantro topped with a Oaxacan Pasilla tomatillo salsa. The salsa was spicy but had a such a great flavor to it. Every bite was magically delicious. Definitely some of the best goat I have ever tried. <br><br>Xoco is definitely a place I will be frequenting more often and will eventually, try everything entree on the menu, including their breakfast entrees. My only regret is being in a rush when we came here, so we weren't able to try their churros.

I must have Shazamed eight songs while we were in there. <br><br>The only negative I have about this place is the ordering system.

It was about 1pm Saturday and the line was at the door. However, the hostess was lovely and gave us menus and explained the process - there are two lines, dining in and takeout. For dining in, you order and then they give you a table number and then they pretty much seat you. You can order drinks in line. They even brought out tlayudas samples for their waiting customers. While very busy, the line did move along and it really wasn't too bad. Definitely not recommended for large groups (4+), but people definitely did so anyway. <br><br>I went with the choriqueso torta and the pistachio churro while sis had the woodland mushroom torta. We had the option of having the churro out first or with our tortas. I enjoyed the self serve water station that included sparking water. Food came out fairly quickly. The tortas were delish. The chorizo and mushrooms were plentiful. While these are certainly significantly smaller in size than your standard torta, they were still very much satisfying and still fairly priced, especially for the area. The pistachio churro was decent, but not remarkable, in the churro itself and the pistachio flavor.<br><br>While it is rather cramped in there, they do make good use of the space for seating, but it is always busy, so it certainly looks smaller than it is.

When you order, they ask how spicy you want it. I opted for medium and let me tell you, it certainly packed a punch! Go for mild if you don't like a lot of spice. It was messy to eat since the bread gets soggy and the meat falls out, but the flavors were incredible. <br><br>It wasn't the cheapest meal for a quick lunch, coming in around $20.

When you walk in, a greeter welcomes you, then escorts you to your seat - standard practice, to be sure, but when the restaurant is 90% empty, why seat your diners in the most compact (and uncomfortable) way possible, rather than give them a little space, especially at a restaurant without waiters and table service? <br><br>I'm a big fan of avocado toast, so when I saw it on the menu, I knew I had to try it. In addition to the Mexican avocado mash, it also contained crispy bacon, tomatoes, a queso añejo, and chicken. When the dish arrived, it was plated quite nicely and looked quite appealing, but actually consuming this dish was another thing altogether. I'm not sure what the kitchen did to the thin 'toast' part of this avocado toast, but it was incredibly difficult to cut through (especially with the cafeteria knife provided to me), making for one big chewy mess, avocado mash all over my fingers, presentation taking precedence over the ability to actually consume the dish. Putting all that aside, the avocado mash just wasn't all that - no spice, no kick, nothing interesting about the seasoning, just bland and a total miss in my book. <br><br>Perhaps I just hit Xoco on an off night, but given prior experience, I do expect more when dining at a Bayless establishment, especially at their price point ($14.50 for this entrée).

Before Xoco, I never envisioned that Mexican sandwiches, or tortas, could be so creatively put together and delicious. No - the food here is definitely not cheap.

I just loved this combination and the bread was perfectly crispy yet soft. I thought it was the ideal sandwich. If this was $5 cheaper, I'd be getting this everyday for lunch.<br>2) AHOGADA - $11 pork carnitas sandwich dipped in a tomato chile broth that can be customized to your desired heat-level. I love spice and thought the 'hot' was pretty spicy! This is pretty messy to eat and the soggy bread requires that you down the sandwich faster than you can chew. The tomato chile addition really elevated the sandwich to the next level. Highly recommended!<br>3) PISTACHIO & HAZELNUT CHURROS - at $2.25 per churro, these were not your usual churros. There was a generous serving of pistachios but I really didn't think the sauces on these churros were anything special. Sure, if you're looking for a dessert - you can't go wrong with these. But then again, don't expect to be mindblown.<br>4) SHORT RIB TACOS - $13 for 4 tacos, these were my least favorite. For $3.25/taco, it was pricier than most tacos and not proportionally better. Yes, they were good. But definitely not a highlight.<br><br>Come here and order their specialty tortas! You won't be disappointed.<br><br>Btw - it's pronounced 'SHO-ko'.

We also ordered a side salad, but I think they might have mixed us up with another table because instead of the side salad, we got the pumpkin seed dip.<br><br>We hadn't ordered the dip, but they let us keep it, and it was really good! It's almost like a hummus, but has a different flavor that I can't really describe. The chips were a little salty, but the jicama and cucumbers were both really fresh and tasted great dipped in the dip. The chicken tacos were really flavorful and well cooked. The avocado added a nice creaminess, and the salsa on the side provided a nice kick. The pork tacos, on the other hand, weren't as saucy as the chicken, but the pork was so so so tender! The salsa verde that comes with it gives it just enough flavor to prevent from being bland. I really like the pork ones because they weren't drenched in sauce to make you feel unhealthy.<br><br>The salad we had ordered wasn't coming but when we asked about it, they actually brought it out. Again, I think they might have messed up and given the dip to the wrong table, but it was nice that they let us keep it and still gave us the salad.

By adding only homemade queso fresco , the tanginess really stood out with the fresh house made tortilla chips dusted with lime salt. <br><br>The XOCO signature salad is a mixture of romaine and arugula, topped with black beans, avocado, onions, tortilla strips and a tart avocado-lime dressing. The salad was light and delicious and I'll be sure to order extra dressing because it is wonderful!<br><br>The crispy Chicharrones were a delicate and airy treat topped with queso anejo, cilantro, and onions. I don't say this very often, but the side of tamazula hot sauce was almost too hot for me. So I'm glad it was on the side- the kick was powerful!<br><br>The side of Oaxacan-style Peanuts came in a cute cellophane package; the seasoning of roasted garlic with lime and arbol chiles tasted just as it looked- spicy salty goodness!<br><br>When it came to the Meal-In-A-Bowl Caldos, we decided on the slow-cooked pork carnitas. The broth was delightful, containing potato-masa dumplings, chayote, roasted serrano chile, arugula, and avocado. The dry ingredients were on the side so they didn't get soggy. The ratio of broth to product was perfect and I even dipped my portion of the tortas into the soup to sop up that mouth-watering broth. <br><br>We ordered three styles of tortas for variety and each one had flavors that stood out on their own:<br><br>The Cubana (from the griddle) had thick strips of bacon piled on smoked pork loin, topped with black beans, avocado, jack cheese, chipotle mustard, morita chiles, and a house made cilantro crema. It was smoky, creamy, and hearty. <br><br>The Daily Special for Friday was the Smoky Garlic Shrimp. The seared, plump and juicy shrimp were smothered in chipotle-garlic mojo with arugula, black beans, onions, and goat cheese. Each bite was a harmonious blend and one ingredient never overpowered the others.<br><br>The Woodland Mushroom (from the wood burning oven) was easily my favorite of the tortas. As the vegetarian option, it had meaty wood-roasted garlic mushrooms, black beans, arugula, goat cheese, housemade three-chile salsa, and a drizzle of olive oil. I savored Every. Single. Bite. and wished we had ordered two of them. <br><br>We received extra tomatillo and three-chile salsas- much appreciated!<br><br>I wanted to try the Xoco flan, but they were out, so I opted for the Tres Leches Cake as my birthday dessert.

Walk in. Get on the line to your right (there will probably be a line, but it will be tolerable). Meanwhile, the hostess will ask you how many people are in your party for seating.<br>2. Pick up a menu. While you wait on line, a hostess will come back to tell you what your table number is. Only when there is a table available to seat your party will you be allowed to order.<br>3. When it's your turn, go up to the counter. Their first question will be what your table number is. <br>4. Tell them your table number. Order, including drinks and desserts. Desserts will be brought to your table only after you've finished the food.<br>5. Grab free water/seltzer at the soda machine, wander into the seating area to the left of the entrance. Little numbered signs identify each table; it's mostly bar seating for small groups and couples.<br>6. Find your table. Wait for your food. <br>7. Eat. Technically there's no waitservice, but if you need extra sauce or whatever, flag someone down and they will bring it with a smile. <br><br>We had:<br><br>- Ahogada torta (\"drowned sandwich\"): A sandwich native to Guadalajara, but could just as well be Bayless' Mexican ode to the Chicago-style roast beef sandwich soaked in jus. The torta is meant to be soggy, and is served cut side down in a shallow tomato soup that tastes like devastatingly salty marinara sprinkled with cilantro. The mushy bread was comforting and the pork carnitas inside was tender. The soup was so distractingly salty though.<br><br>- Chicharrones: The type of chicharrones that's only skin and not pork belly. Huge airy chunks were hopelessly smothered in a hot sauce whose tartness overpowered all other flavors. The chicharrones themselves were not much different from a pack of pork rinds.<br><br>- \"Fully Dressed\" guacamole: Accompanied by their normal chips + red/green salsas. The tortilla chips are the normal, bagged kind - sad to say that Chipotle (when freshly fried) does it much better. The guacamole was fine, but if you appreciate a good guacamole then this was too much, the Guy Fieri of guacamole. Toppings included: roasted poblano, chicharron, onion, bacon nubs, tomato, queso fresco, and pumpkin seeds. I wish we'd gotten the \"Almost Naked\" guacamole instead, with only bacon and pumpkin seeds.<br><br>- Pistachio glazed churro. A cute looped churro in a nutty glaze, served warm. I'm not a dessert person, but this was my favorite item.<br><br>Xoco definitely serves up fun, loud food, though in the end, nothing was as delicious as I'd hoped. <br><br>Unrelated note: Bayless is another white dude revered for cooking \"ethnic\" food. Not downplaying his expertise or suggesting that he's necessarily appropriating Mexican culture - but remember what it means when we worship him for his mastery of Mexican cuisine. Would the grandma cooking this stuff in her kitchen in her native country, or even the Mexican immigrant planning to open a restaurant in the US, get that same kind of appreciation from us? And if we do appreciate people cooking food familiar to them as part of their everyday lives, do we then fetishize it by making thoughtless comments about \"authenticity\" and \"discovery\"?", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uRT5IgDlXeTOsHnEbkvgsg/348s.jpg", "caption": "Pistachio glazed churro"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nBzUsdcMa4rQjz6Oft-JVQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Ahogada torta"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OcDtH8Jzj2d1uv6ZSuFg_g/168s.jpg", "caption": "Chicharrones"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "My short rib soup was tasty but the staff did not seem to have much regard for their order mistake and there were no tortillas with the soup.<br>Restroom accommodations are insufficient", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This place is awesome.

The guacamole was SO good and they really give you your money's worth. This is definitely shareable between 3 people as we were close to finishing our basket of chips, yet we still didn't finish our guac. It breaks my heart whenever there's leftover avocado or guac, but we just couldn't stuff anymore down our stomach after our amazing meal. The Cubana was hefty portion of meat (pork loin and bacon) w/ avocado, black bean spread, as well as a chipotle mustard.

They have daily special tortas and my husband chose that, which happened to be chipotle shrimp - also very delicious. When eating some of the best sandwiches in the country such as the Philly Cheesesteak, Chicago Italian Beef, NYC deli pastrami on rye, a good po'boy or muffuletta, etc., people will always tell you the bread makes a huge difference in making a good sandwich GREAT. I've had tortas before on crappy bread. Let me tell you, the bread they use on their tortas here are EVERYTHING. The crunchy, crustiness of the bread when you bite down is exactly how it should be. The sandwich doesn't fall apart with its contents dropping down onto your plate. It's the perfect vessel and the way it cradles the food and sauces, it doesn't get soggy and messy. Their ingredients are superb I'm not downplaying them at all, bc my chicken was pretty damn tasty. But I'm telling you, if they effed up the bread it would seriously make a huge diff. <br><br>In addition to our tortas, we shared chips and guac which you can get dressed with various accoutrements - we did it fully dressed and it did not disappoint! The chicharron on top made it next level guac lol. We also shared the churros w/ soft serve. Perfect texture and the ice cream was real vanilla bean. Dipping my churro in the ice cream also did NOT make it soggy. Best churro I've ever had. <br><br>Overall everything was delicious. Service was fast, food was tasty, served and plated nicely but also no frills, the place is small but it didn't feel overwhelmingly cramped.

The menu here is composed of mostly Mexican sandwiches, soups, and snacks as well as some breakfast options and a few cocktails. A great place to come for a unique lunch.<br><br>Located in Chicago's bustling downtown River North area on the same block as two of Bayless's other more upscale dining locations (Topolobampo and Frontera Grill). You walk in and hop into line which was short when I arrived around 11:30 AM on a thursday in July but grew tremendously fast thereafter. After ordering you retreat to a table or counter stool of your choice with your drinks and your food will be brought out and delivered to you soon after. Note that if you order an oven roasted sandwich like I did it will take about 15 minutes to come out.<br><br>For my food I of course had to order the churros with housemade chocolate for dipping since they get constant rave reviews and always make the list of top foods to try in Chicago. I also went with the Thursday specialty shortrib sandwich for my main course. The churros and chocolate were pretty good but nothing out of this world. The shortrib sandwich was very good and came with a very flavorful dipping sauce. The sandwich came loaded with black beans, cactus salad, and avocado which made for a delicious, flavorful, and unique blend of flavors. For a drink I ordered the Mezcal Fresco which tasted a bit watered down and was small for the cost of $11.<br><br>Overall I totally recommend this place as a really nice and reasonably priced lunch spot for a unique Mexican meal prepared by people who know what they're doing when it comes to Mexican cooking.

It's my go-to when I'm in the area and I want food. At this point I've tried almost every torta on the menu and I can honestly say they're all amazing. But I have my favorites.<br><br>My top 3 are the Baja Chicken, the Choriqueso, and the Goat Barbacoa (the Saturday special).<br><br>The Baja Chicken is a delicious chicken sandwich. Unlike many of the other tortas, this one isn't as greasy. When I come here with a friend and we decide to split the tortas (they're cut in half) I always make sure one of us order this one. Sometimes you need something to offset all oil. And this sandwich satisfies that need while tasting insanely delicious.<br><br>The Choriqueso is a delicious, greasy, chorizo filled sandwich. You shouldn't even smell this sandwich if you're on a diet. But all the chorizo is definitely worth it. This sandwich just melts in your mouth and you definitely appreciate the structure of the bread. The bread seems a bit of an overkill for most of their sandwiches but for the Choriqueso it is a necessity because the grease just gets absorbed. And you still have a sandwich, not a mess.<br><br>The Goat Barbacoa is delicious and I'm sad it's only available on Saturdays. As such, I've only had it a few times but it's wormed it's way into my heart by satisfying my stomach. The braised goat just melts in your mouth. <br><br>Other things I recommend are the guacamole and their margaritas. Just spend the 8 dollars to get all the toppings on the guacamole.

Let me just say this, Xoco is the greatest unexpected surprise! After a wild night, my body was craving COFFEEEEE. I was looking for something good and affordable. Yelpers recommended XOCO! Yelp, you were NOT wrong! <br>Let me just say, whatever I ate and drank NEVER HAD A CHANCE. It was completely devoured within minutes! Even with a sour stomach from all that partying the night before! LOL!  The entrance is a bit wonky but it works.

Once he you tell him, he tells you your table number and directs you to the very friendly cashiers to take your order. As you're walking towards them you will notice a very busy and working kitchen behind you making churros and other items. My eyes and stomach just couldn't wait to have a try.  Xoco is known for their Torta Ahogada and freshly made Churros! I decided to have BOTH plus a Chocolate Café Con Leche! Which unfortunately due to me still being drunk from the night before, I couldn't say nor understand the concept to save my life!!! HA HA! Seriously! Lets start with the Chocolate Café con Leche! It reminded me of my childhood. It was soooo delicious, and so creamy. I actually went back every morning! <br>The Torta Ahogada was so flavorful, I ate the entire thing PLUS the marinade! Then finally the churro arrived and I just couldn't eat another bite! Seriously, my stomach was about to burst. However me being me, I just had to have a taste. I took a small bite from the churro and dipped it in the chocolate sauce. I really wish I hadn't! My taste buds took over and devoured the churro like a monster and even licked the little cup of chocolate sauce! No Joke. My stomach was literally busting at the seams that I went across the way to Macys and bought me a sweater =). <br><br>Yelpers, you will not be disappointed. You will LOVE XOCO as much as I did.

Once we were done ordering and getting our waters, the hostess showed us to our table. Not too long afterwards, our food came. <br><br>We got four carnitas tacos ($12). The tacos have guacamole, onions, and cilantro. They were really good and flavorful. I gobbled my tacos and instantly wanted more. The real winner of the meal, however, was the caldo. Typically, I don't order veggie soups at restaurants since they're usually bland and devoid of ingredients. This veggie soup, however, was fantastic. It had black beans, zucchini, mushrooms, potato-masa dumplings, avocado, serrano chile, and other greens. All for $10.50. It was very filling, and it tasted so, so good.

You then place your order at the counter and they bring the food out to you. They will hold dessert until you've finished up your entree. <br><br>We had the ahogada and pork belly noodle soup. The ahogada is a pork sandwich that is placed in a bowl of thick tomato based soup. Presentation is beautiful but the mixture of flavors were a little weird for me. It could also be that I don't like soggy sandwiches and would have preferred to have the sandwich and sauce/soup separate. <br><br>The pork belly soup has pork belly, mushroom, avocado, zucchini, and some bitter greens. The salsa negra is a spicy hoisin sauce. For people familiar with Vietnamese food, this is a Spanish American version of \"bun bo hue\" or spicy beef noodle soup. The dish is ok but I think it could use more noodles and less of the greens because of the bitter taste. The thing that really killed this dish for me was that I found a dead BUG in the soup. However, the manager of the store dealt with it very professionally.

I am a huge fan of dark chocolate but didn't like the bitter or unsweet taste of the hot chocolate. The churros were warm, crispy, and good. The ice cream must be made with the same chocolate because it was also slightly bitter. I love churros and ice cream but the two didn't really go very well together.

Churros eventually came out and they were the best churros I've ever had. (The only other churros I've ever had were from Costco so idk if that's saying much.) I had the plain churro with chocolate dipping sauce and my friends got the hazelnut and pistachio churros. The chocolate dipping sauce is legit real dark chocolate. It's not that Hershey's syrup stuff. I was surprised and it took a bit getting used to it. The pistachio also did not taste the way I thought it would. Honestly the hazelnut was the best.

You order the food at the counter, the person at the counter will assign you a table number, then the waiter will guide you to your table. <br><br>Food: I ordered the ahogada torta ($11), which is one of the more popular items on the menu. It has pork carnitas with pickled onions and it sits in a chile broth. You can choose your spice level and I chose mild but it was a little spicy for me. I wish the bread wasn't soggy because I like my sandwiches dry. I usually don't like dipping my sandwiches in sauce (like French Dip in Au Jus or Italian Beef) but I appreciate that the sandwich was flavorful with the onions and chile broth and that the pork was tender.  My dad ordered the seafood caldo, or soup, ($13) with shrimp, catfish, mussels, cilantro, and lime in chile broth. He liked his soup but he wished he had rice with it to make it more filling. (we're Asian, we eat rice with everything!) We also had chips with tomatillo and 3 chile salsa. The chips had a hint of lime flavor and I preferred the 3 chile (green) salsa over the tomatillo (red) salsa.<br><br>For drinks, I tasted the Authentic Hot Chocolate ($3), which had ground chocolate and water and my dad had the agua fresca ($3), agua del dia (water of the day), Raspberry Lime. My hot chocolate was rich but a little bitter, it tasted like dark chocolate. It took some getting used to but I ended up liking the bitter taste. My dad liked his Raspberry Lime agua fresca, though it was more on the lime-y side. <br><br>As for dessert, we had the pistachio, hazelnut, and original plain churro with the chocolate dipping sauce on the side. Of all the churros, the pistachio had the best flavor and I recommend ordering that one if you had to choose a flavor. The churros tasted like donuts and were not greasy.

Upon seeing the building you can witness the baking area and kitchen from the window which is very cool. They also have an eating area outside incase they are packed indoors. My wife and I stopped by Friday night about an hour before closing. We were concerned about the quality of food due to us showing up at this time. <br><br>Once we entered we really didn't know how everything worked. So I spoke to someone who was helping another customer, and they got me in touch with the hostess. While in line to order she gave us a table number and we placed our order with a really nice young lady. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and had a great personality. Our food choices are below. <br><br>Chips & Salsa + Guac: The chips were freaking delicious. The texture and crunch was nice. With the chips we received a green and red salsa. Both were slightly different in flavor and not spicy at all. I'm sure they have spicier salsa but we didn't really check. Now the Guac, oh man. Not only is there fresh made Guac, they had a variety of things that enhanced the flavor. You had queso fresco, onions, tomatoes, and much more. You could also get I believe bacon as well but we do not eat pork. <br><br>Pepido Torta: This is a Hispanic sandwich and there are usually several versions. This one was made of short rib meat and basically looked like barbacoa. The bread of the sandwich was a little too crunchy for my liking. The beef was delicious and the toppings were minimal and complimented each other very very well. <br><br>Churros w/chocolate sauce: Let's put it this way, I ordered this for myself and had to split half with my wife. These churros were warm and the chocolate sauce tasted amazing. I was basically dipping the churro and trying to get as much sauce on it to eat. The crunch and softness was very well balanced. <br><br>Cuatro Leches Cake: Traditionally we see this cake wet and with a layer of sauce at the base.

Sadly, it could be argued that the Bayless torta actually pales in comparison to the school cafeteria pizza slice.  The latter succeeds through a sort of minimalism in which the unsophisticated  palate is appeased by a formula comprised of 95% carbs (that \"dough\" which never seemed to be able to completely lose its frozen quality), 3% cheese, 2% of the thinnest sauce imaginable, and then 1% pepperoni (typically one slice, never more than two).  It's quick and dirty and meets nutritional requirements if they were to be set forth by your average 12 year-old.  The appalling Xoco torta seems to have decided to take the opposite approach in that it exponentially increases the sludge comprising the aforementioned 5% of ingredients (sauce, meat, and cheese, essentially).  Therein lies the brilliance of Xoco (at least from the bottom-line point of view of the proprietor):  it has figured out how to pass off industrial waste as higher-concept, casual \"Mexican\" fare (though it's disgraceful to associate it with anything remotely Mexican, particularly in Chicago) as a means of extorting tourists and, apparently, a significant number of locals who should really know better.  Oh--I think I also mentioned pozole.

Tried out the Ahogada as well as the Baja Chicken, and also ordered a Pistachio Churro and Flan Cake as a dessert(appetizer?). First impressions; strange mixture been fast casual dining and an actual sit-down restaurant. It looks like it's set up to be a Panera, except that you're greeted at the door and as you're in line to order, a server will come to reserve a table for you. Makes the place a little more crowded than necessary, but eh I'll let it slide.<br>Given that this restaurant is the cheapest in the Rick Bayless chain I was pretty excited to actually try out some of his food that was actually in my price range. Upon arrival, was a little disappointed at the size of the sandwiches. For $10-12 each, I suppose I expected something a little bit more substantial. But I'll hold judgment till first bite. The Chicken Baja upon first bite was actually quite good. If only because I was able to actually get some of the very flavorful chicken in that bite. Unfortunately the ratio of the sandwhich was a very heavy toward bread, and there just wasn't enough filling in there to really make it worth it. Too bad, it was some tasty torta otherwise(when it was just a bite of bread anyways).<br><br>As for the Ahogada, this one was actually a bit more substantial and had a decent amount of carnitas inside. That said, didn't enjoy the flavor as much as the Baja chicken and the pickled white onions actually had a sourness that rather overpowered the rest of the torta, even with the tomato broth. The carnitas on their own tasted alright as well, but I don't know if I'd go out of my way to get them again.<br><br>The Flan cake and Churros tasted good. Actually a big fan of the pistachio glaze and flavor, though the churro itself could have been warmer on delivery. <br><br>Verdict: Underwhelming.

Living in Chicago for the past 3 years, and just a few blocks away, Xoco became my absolute favorite go-to-spot - I would visit 3-5x a week (and they are only open 5 days a week!). But unfortunately just like everything else in River North, this place is no longer on my food list.<br> <br>It is not only the diminishing food quality, the wait or high prices, but my decision to stop going is based on the management and staff. Since Maria became manager over the past 1.5 to years, she has run the restaurant with an iron fist - she particularly has no idea about the concept of customer service and how to treat guests, especially her regular customers. The Xoco staff has made countless mistakes with order timings or providing incomplete or wrong orders - but instead of apologizing or offering compensation/free item (which costs a mere $.20 cents), there is no apology and instead every time we are treated with complete disrespect and with rudeness with a \"how dare you mention we made a mistake?\" It leaves a terrible experience for you and your guests. And this is a consistent experience that customers face. No food is worth it when it is ready well after the time promised, having it made incorrectly, or when the customer paying for the food is treated with such disrespect.<br> <br>Bayless would be disappointed to hear about the diminished quality of service and customer experience - Maria may hit her financial numbers, but has no people skills whatsoever which will eventually severely impact the restaurant long term. It takes away from the experience to be honest. The entire original staff that was transitioned to Maria when she has started are no longer there, and even a few smart chefs have opened their own restaurants in Pilsen (5 Rabanitos) or in Irving Park (Ixcateco grill). These restaurants are much better - better food quality, faster service, cheaper, and most importantly, incredible service.<br> <br>I highly recommend the next time you want a $12+ for a Torta, visit Pilsen (just a short 10 min cab or on the L train from Xoco) and get your money's worth.

But then the host is actually standing at the order counter rather than at the front, so my friends and I were standing at the front for a good 10 minutes before we realized we were supposed to go up to the counter. They also won't take your order until you get a seat, so if you have a large party at the counter waiting for a table, it totally holds up the order line and congests the whole space. I'm not sure what would work better with how narrow the entrance is, but perhaps open seating might actually work better?

On the one hand, it's really good. The food deserves 5 stars, but isn't this suppose to be the \"more affordable\" version of Frontera and isn't this suppose to be America's version of Mexican \"street food?\" I've been to Mexico, many times, and let me tell you I have had some mind blowing street food and it did not cost $15 for one item. Yeah, that's my beef with Xoco. I have been there a few times to check out the tortas and they are so good, but $12+tax+tip will leave you just over $15 for one torta and that's if you get the free water to drink. <br><br>To be honest, I have had a talk with myself, and by myself I mean my meager budget, and we agreed that I would only go to Xoco for the Ahogada: Golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, and pickled onions.

Pozole, ok yes, on a cold day. Churros and Mexican hot chocolate yes, always. I can take or leave everything else. <br><br>My only other beef with Xoco is the incredibly absurd ordering/seating system. I mean, wtf? Did they get a hold of the DMV's \"best practices\" and go from there? You walk in and someone hands you a menu and says a number to you, but doesn't explain what that number might be used for as you make your way to the counter. Why the menu? There is a very large chalkboard with all of the food right in front of you as you stand in line and there's no where to dump the menu. The person taking your order ask for a number. Um, shouldn't you be giving me a number? Wouldn't that cut down on a lot of unnecessary confusion for staff and guests? Come on Rick, fix this. Stat. It's very silly. <br><br>All in all, the food is fantastic. And overpriced.

It was my first time ordering chicharrones so I can't compare or comment on authenticity BUT I have to say that these were exactly what I envisioned them to be.

The Choriqueso, although it had good flavors tasted more like an elaborate meatball sub. With the short rib torta, I had a difficult time distinguishing the cactus salad and black beans that were supposed to be in it. So there you go - good, but not great. <br><br>Iced Mint Chocolate - Very pure but because of that, the drink was grainy. You can tell that the mint was fresh though.

We wanted to try Frontera Grill but got here late and couldn't wait 90 min with two kids, and the hostess suggested we try Xoco instead. It's a terrible concept for a restaurant. First, you have to stand in a very long line to order. There's a sign suggesting enjoying a margarita in the line, but no bar and no one to take drink orders. We placed our order and were assigned a table number. The staff person said he would take us there and then disappeared, but after making a lap we realized that tables were shared and crammed in next to another group. The music is very loud, and it was difficult to carry on a conversation. My 5 y/o wanted to leave due to the noise level while we were still in line, and we should have listened. <br><br>We found our table, and drinks arrived in a reasonable time frame. Our guacamole and shortly after, and was fantastic. Chicharonnes came next, and were mediocre. They got soggy from the spicy sauce drizzled over them after a few minutes, but perhaps this is how some people like them. Next to arrive were the kids' entrees. An order is 4 tacos, and I wish the menu would have stated that. They each had one, so we wasted a ton of food. Several minutes later my husband's tlayuda arrived. It was also good, although the optional chorizo made it too heavy and soggy - we wish we'd ordered it without. Still no sign of my food, so I got up to stand in the long line again to order another drink. I returned to the table, and had some more of my family's food. The kids were finished eating and the tlayuda half gone when we finally flagged down a waiter to ask for my caldo to be cancelled. There was no explanation for a 20+ minute delay between the first and last entree hitting the table. They eventually tried to bring the soup out gratis, but the music volume was making my older son beg to leave. The staff took it off the bill. <br><br>As stated, the food tasted good. The atmosphere was horrible. For a family, a couple, or a single diner. I don't mind restaurants that are crowded or loud with conversation. We don't mind ordering at counters at barbecue places or local taquerias. The combination of the long line, excessive portions (especially at a shared table), music volume, lack of space, and the entree delivery (or lack thereof) prompted this bad review.

The torta was a flavor explosion in my mouth with the spiciness of the broth, the hint of lime and the beans & onions all mixing together. Every ingredient had its place and was destined to be together in my sandwich.. The part of the bread that was soaked in the broth was soggy and the other half of the bread was crunchy but the best part was the bread near the middle. The broth was a bit spicy for me and I found myself sucking down multiple glasses of water. You do get your choice of salsa -- mild, medium or hot.

It's a whole other level, y'all!<br><br>I took a star away because, like some other reviewers noted, it's pretty confusing how the seating/ordering works. Also, we got there at 2pm and the wait was like 40 minutes. I think I'll try to get in earlier or later next time...So basically, you have to order first and then get seated. BUT, you can only order once you're given a table number. If the host or hostess doesn't give you a table number, then you can't order yet. So you just stand there at the register and wait for a table to become available. And then you can order once you get your table number. Got it? Good. OK, on to the food!<br><br>There were 4 of us, so I made the executive decision of ordering a bunch of different dishes so that we can all share. Heck yeah! Vuh-Rye-Uh-Teeeeee. <br><br>TORTAS:<br><br>The Ahogada torta comes with the pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, and pickled onions. They top the torta halves on top of the tomato broth and serve it that way. By the time you take a bite, the warm soup has seeped into the bread for added flavoring. I mean...wow! This was the group favorite fosho. <br><br>The seasonal torta was the Pork belly with tomatillo sauce, chicharrón, local spinach, queso fresco, and black beans. This was one of my personal favorites. I do love my pork belly!<br><br>Cochinita Pibil: Woah, when they said the salsa was spicy, they meant SPICY. It's definitely got a kick that's reminiscent of the red sauce at King Taco or El Taurino. Finally! I've found a match!!!! This torta came with wood-roasted suckling pig with achiote, black beans, pickled onion, and habanero. I think the sauce was overpowering, so it was difficult to really taste the sandwich itself. Once you let the heat calm down a bit, the torta itself can be enjoyed. But beware of the hot sauce! Maybe try the sandwich before you dip it in the salsa?<br><br>SOUPS:<br><br>Shortrib Red Chile Soup: Braised Tallgrass shortribs, red chile broth, roasted vegetables, epazote, wild arugula, lime. This one was the group favorite soup-wise. It reminded us of a spicy Korean soup called Yook-gae-jang. It's a refreshing type of red broth that paired well with the different tortas.<br><br>Wood-Roasted Chicken Pozole: Gunthorp chicken, pozole corn, rich broth, crunchy garnishes, ground red chile, lime. I kind of wish this was spicier or something. But maybe with all the amazing flavors of the other dishes, this one was sort of overpowered? It's a clean chicken broth with a lot of veggies. Someone from our group called it a poor-man's-soup haha. There was some leftover so I took it home. I'll probably add some Tapatio to it to add that extra kick.<br><br>---------------<br><br>The guacamole and chips were nothing special...I don't know how crazy you can get with guac, as long as the avocado isn't going bad.<br><br>**Highly recommend that you try the Churros with the chocolate shot: amazing! The chocolate has just the right amount of bitter sweetness, like a good dark chocolate sauce should be.

I flipped open Yelp, saw Xoco nearby, and believe I heard good things about it from other sources so I headed in that direction. Also note that I walked past a Chipotle to get here and that I only went here under the impression service was speedy. <br><br>First of all, let me say that the service system is a hot mess. You walk in. You must specify whether you're dining in or carrying out as there are two different counters for that. When you're dining in, you are assigned a number you must remember. The hostess did not specify why I had a seat number, I just did. Was I 120 in line? Was I supposed to find seat 120? Should I wait until this number is called? I promptly forget my number after staring at the menu, great. A new seat awaits (I swear I am not forgetful, I was just overwhelmed and mildly dyslexic)! You order up front with your number apparently and go find the hostess again, and give her your number so she can show you your seat. Why didn't you just give me a placard with the number like a normal fast casual restaurant is beyond me. It was clearly inefficient because I saw the runner just approaching random people with the wrong food, and looking confused. I'm completely surprised with this terrible system because Bayless grew up in the industry, he should know this is a hot mess. It was as annoying as trying to get service at a genius bar in a crowded Apple store before a phone release. <br><br>The best thing here I've tried was the hibiscus tea. And it better be at $3 a glass! It essentially tastes like starbucks passion tea lemonade. If you like passion tea lemonade, you like hibiscus tea. With my delicious hibiscus tea, I ordered the carne asada torta special and the chicharones. The chicharones look bangin' on yelp and all of the tortas look pretty legit so I thought I couldn't go wrong (especially with ordering a special which should be a \"highlight\" on a menu!) <br><br>I got my chicharones pretty quickly but once you get past the first layer of hot sauce and onions it gets pretty burdensome. They didn't add enough toppings and only dressed the top layer so the rest is just plain old pork rinds. I felt like my rinds were rancid tasting too- maybe that's how they're \"supposed\" to taste, I'm not a huge pork fan, but any other time I had pork rinds they didn't taste like this. I continue eating them anyways because I was starving and patiently waiting for my entree to come out. <br><br>30+ minutes in, I figured they lost my order because I'm watching people who clearly just walked in get fed. I inquire, and they look confused and consult with a bunch of other people (they even had to ask if I had a receipt to show that I actually ordered a sandwich - no I came here to slowly eat pork rinds and not eat real food for 45 minutes! ) They try to comp with some free chips but honestly I could not be bothered to wait around any longer for chips.<br><br>Now why I actually rated this coveted restaurant a 2/5 was the fact that my Mexican food was bland. as. hell. Holy crap. No flavor express. I regret so hard not going to chipotle within one bite of my carne asada torta. No spice, no salt, barely any acidity. The salsa just tasted of roasted tomatillo and nothing else. The chimichurri just tasted like watered down, blended parsley. This is the type of Mexican food you'd feel safe serving at a old folk's home because it's so inoffensive and flavorless if you blindfolded them they'd swear it came from Subway. Everything you would ever want from Mexican food is missing. I paid over $20 for this meal and Taco Bell could out-flavor this joint (lesson earned: don't pay $20 for Mexican food unless it's sizzling fajitas). <br><br>Maybe if my sandwich had an ample amount of juicy, premium carne asada I'd say that'd make up for it, but gosh, even that was bland. Do they even season the meat? Are they aware of what salt is? Is there a lime shortage? <br><br>I've been on a one week flavor adventure in Chicago and Iowa and by and large, this was the worst meal I had the entire time. Skip, skip, skip.

My friend ordered a Cuban sandwich, my other friend ordered the shrimp sandwich and I ordered the mushroom sandwich. They were all fresh and delicious! I especially liked mine, with the goat cheese and arugula with a spicy sauce to match it. We ended it with an assortment of churros, 3 regular, 1 chocolate and 1 pistachio. My favorite was the pistachio - it was so different than what I'm normally used to and perfectly cooked! It was certainly satisfying. Difficult seating, with average service aside from the lady who came by and cleaned our table with a smile and so polite, but delectable food that arrived pretty quickly although a little overpriced.

I think the caldo was the wood-fired chicken pozole. Another reason for the 3 stars is unfortunately this caldo was waaayyy too salty. We didn't finish it it was so salty.

I became a huge fan of Rick Bayless after seeing him compete on Top Chef Masters and I knew that he had several restaurants in Chicago.  Rick Bayless is known in the culinary world as an expert of Mexican cuisine and having lived in Mexico city for some time and being a lover of Mexican food, I decided to visit one of his restaurants in Chicago. After reviewing his restaurants, I selected XOCO mainly because of the great reviews it has received, and also because it is one of his most budget friendly restaurants. Remember that I did say that I had made a \"list\" of restaurants that I wanted to visit.<br><br>When I walked in to the restaurant there was a hostess that gave me a number. I did not know what the number was for, but she told me to give it to the person at the cash register.  After I paid for my meal and walked over to sit down, another staff member asked me for the number I was given and showed me to my seat. Ahhh so the number was the number of my seat. It was 9am after all and my brain had yet to cease sleeping.<br><br>I started off by ordering \"The Authentic\" which was an authentic Mexican hot chocolate.  It tasted a little bitter and it was very thick. It almost had a bit of an oily texture to it. I certainly think it is an acquired taste. After a couple of sips I got used to it. Though I probably would not order it again.<br><br>The water they offered was not flat, which was a disappointment to me because I do not like fizzy water.

I had high hopes that I would receive a hot churro because to me there is nothing worse than a cold pastry. When it was brought to my seat I received it nice and hot and straight out of the frier. The chocolate sauce felt redundant after the hot chocolate, though this sauce did taste like dark chocolate without the oily-like texture.<br><br>So, I am not a fan of onions and I understood that ordering at XOCO would be challenging because the majority of Mexican dishes use onions. So after reviewing the menu I asked if I could have the Huevos Rancheros with the sauce on the side. They said that this would be possible, but that there was no point since the dish would not taste good without the sauce. Huh? Are you kidding with me? How can it not taste good without the sauce? I am Hispanic and I have been eating tortillas with eggs, beans and cheese most of my life WITHOUT a sauce! So they suggested the French Toast instead. NO! I said. I know what I want and put the sauce on the side. With a sigh they put in the order. So this is what I received. It looks damn delicious to me!<br><br>I took a moment to taste the sauce and the onions were chopped quite finely that I could not even taste them. Perfect!  So I proceeded to pour the sauce over the tortillas, cheese, eggs and beans.<br><br>I did enjoy my time at XOCO and found the food to be quite tasty. But for some reason I remember feeling a little disappointed when I finished my meal. I am not sure if it was the small portion (I like a big breakfast), or having to negotiate how I wanted my meal.

This is the third pozole I have eaten at three different restaurants and is probably my favorite (though they were all very different versions). The pozole corn (hominy) was a perfect texture of chewy without being too hard or too soft. I am not the biggest fan of white meat chicken and that seemed to be what was in the soup which is the only disappointment.

The ordering system is cafeteria style with a line, then an ordering station, and then your food comes out on the other end. If you are dining in the hostess will verify this with you and then show you to your seat after you order. Otherwise you just wait near the end to pick up your food.

Who cares- good food is worth waiting for!

We also couldn't pass up the churros and put an order in for 3. We filled our glasses with water (your choice of tap or sparkling with slices of lime- classy!) and were seated our our table.<br><br>After a short time, our food arrived at our table. We were all surprised that the \"tortas\" we ordered were actually sandwiches. Totally unexpected, but what a great surprise this turned out to be! The bread was crusty on the outside and slightly scooped out on the inside to allow for the scrumptious filling of freshly cooked chicken, avocado, cheese, and arugula. The chicken was marinated in some sort of spice mixture which I couldn't figure out, but it was quite yummy. Upon biting into my \"torta\", I was in love. This may have been one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. Everything tasted so fresh and all of the ingredients just worked together. Not only that, but my friend somehow convinced me to taste the beans (which NEVER happens- EVER), and I actually liked them...enough to put them on my sandwich, as they were meant to be; Rick Bayless really does know what he's doing!<br><br>The salad, which consisted of chopped romaine, arugula, jicama, and cucumbers lightly tossed in an avocado lime dressing was a great compliment to the sandwich and very refreshing on such a hot day. There was quite a bit of jicama and cucumber in the salad, which added a nice crunch, and the dressing was really good- I need to figure out how to recreate this!<br><br>I also tried a bite of the chorizo sausage torta which had some unique flavors. It was good and a bit spicier than our chicken. The seafood meal-in-a-bowl-caldo was also yummy! The soup had the perfect amount of spice without being overbearing, in what looked like a tomato broth, and it was chock full of veggies and a variety of seafood.<br><br>When we finished our meals, we let them know we were ready for our churros. 3 churros and a side of very dark melted chocolate showed up at our table minutes later. We quickly devoured them and didn't leave one drop of chocolate behind (we were licking our fingers- and the cup, I'm not going to lie). The chocolate had a unique taste that nobody could figure out, but it was soooo good.<br><br>I will recommend this restaurant to anybody I know going to Chicago...as soon as I can figure out how to pronounce it.

I do love Mexican food! Okay, so we've got there at 1PM on a Friday and the wait didn't seem too bad at all, considering I've heard that wait time can be up to 3 hours. I think that most likely happens on weekends. So we've waited on line, ordered and paid for everything up front. They will give you a table number and then bring you to your designated table and all you need to do is wait for them to bring you your food.<br><br>The place wasn't really spacious, so I see why the wait can be long. There are higher tables along the restaurant walls and then there are regular tables. For us, a party of 3 shared a table with another party of 3, which was totally fine with us. From the time we've arrived, to placing our order to getting seated it was only 30 minutes! Maybe we were lucky.<br><br>Okay, so for drink I ordered the Papaya Mint Tea, which was sweet with taste of papaya. The drink was not think nor watery. I really like this drink a lot because it is very refreshing. To start we've gotten the churros with chocolate dip. And let me tell you, if you are from NYC and you've tried churros from the Mexican ladies at train stations and you thought those were good, then these will definitely blow you away! Wow, these churros at XOCO were sweet, crispy with a really nice crunch. However, after dipping them in chocolate, the churros tasted a bit bitter. I actually prefer them in it's natural state without the chocolate dip.<br><br>My friend Ms. S gotten the Ahogada, which is golden pork carnitas, black beans torta in spicy arbol chile sauce tomato broth. The toasted bread was to perfection and the spicy broth was so damn good. And the pork carnita was so juicy and tender that they fall apart in your mouth with each bite. <br><br>And for my other friend, Ms. I, she's gotten the vegetables caldo, which was a big bowl of soup that has black beans, woodland mushrooms, zucchini, potato-masa dumplings, greens, avocado and serrano chile. I did not try hers, but she said it was okay. Her food didn't look as appealing as Ms. S and mine and the other people we had shared a table with. I felt bad for Ms. I because I realized this restaurant is not really vegetarian friendly. They don't have much options to choose from.<br><br>While sitting there waiting for my food, I striked up a conversation with the family that was sitting with us. They were super friendly and nice. The daughter has been living in Chicago for 4 years and told me that she comes here as a regular and that sometimes she comes here just to buy churros to go. Her parents were here for the very first time too and they were liking their food a great deal. The father had ordered the Top Chef, which was created by Rick Bayless in Season 1 of Top Chef Masters and also it is the Friday special. The father was really enjoying his torta, which I really wished mine had came already.<br><br>Not for long, mine finally came and I was excited to try. Took a bite and it was like fireworks in the air. The bread was again toasted to perfection and crunchy with every bite. The braised beef tongue and chorizo was full of flavor and very tender. The generous slabs of avocado made the torta rich and creamy. And adding the salsa verde to this delicious creation was literally love at first bite. Everything about this torta was amazing!<br><br>Then to end the show, I've ordered the Homemade Mexican Vanilla Softserve, which was topped with maple pecan bacon streusel and drizzled with salted caramel sauce. I was so engaged in the conversation with the family we shared a table with that Ms. I (vegetarian) tried some of my ice cream. Ms. S and Ms. I thought the topping was brown sugar and kept eating until later on I informed them those were bacon. And the look on Ms. I's face was $@!#*%.

It's nice to see a staff that  makes sure each customer was satisfied with the table he or she were sitting instead of urgently forcing people to sit anywhere. My group got a nice outside table in the front. The tables outside were long and narrow. We weren't allowed to sit facing each other because of pedestrians walking by.

Every person that passed by would stare at us as we devour our delicious lunch. <br><br>Now the food was delicious. My friends and I started with the Guacamole & Chips ($5.75) which came with two salsas. One salsa looked like a green tomatillo salsa and the other salsa was a red/orange chile salsa.

The torta consist of braised goat with a special salsa, avocado, onions and cilantro. The ingredients were so simple but it was very flavorful. Also the bread that they use was nicely toasted and very crunchy. My other friend had the Pork Belly Vermicelli ($12). It's basically a bowl of beautiful red broth with vermicelli noodles and crispy pork belly, harmonized with chopped zucchini, mushrooms, onions, and avocados. I thought it was interesting that they would add avocados in the savory soup. My friend let me try the broth and it was nice to taste how these ingredients compliment each other.

I did an extensive amount of research, so I decided to go during off-peak hours (anytime before 6pm) just to grab a couple of yummy snacks.<br><br>Here's my individual ranking of everything we ate:<br><br>Pepito Torta (5 stars) - The bread was perfectly crisp, although it was more reminiscent of a submarine sandwich, as opposed to your traditional torta. Nonetheless, the meat was incredibly tender and of high quality (braised tallgrass short ribs!), the onions added a great sweetness, and the jalapenos, black beans, and artisan jack cheese added a wonderfully spicy kick. I loved this sandwich! I would definitely get it again.<br><br>Churros (5 stars) - XOCO is known for these! These were the fluffiest, lightest, and most delectable churros I've ever had the chance to consume. Perfectly dusted with sugar and tiny specks of cinnamon for a powerfully sweet experience! They came with chocolate sauce for dipping, but I actually preferred them plain because the chocolate was way too rich for my taste.<br><br>Fresh guacamole, salsa, and chips (3 stars) - Underwhelming. Do yourself a favor and just pick up some Bayless salsas in the Frontera jars at any grocery store in Chicago. Pretty much the same thing. Nothing special at all.<br><br>Hot Chocolate (3 stars) - Overhyped. Waaaaay too sweet and rich for my taste. You could really taste the cacao beans, which reminded me of coffee, but was unbelievably strong for my liking. <br><br>Because the latter two items were not that great...I am ranking this place 4 stars. Frontera Grill is still waaaay better, but this is still definitely a restaurant not to be missed if you are in Chicago! The churros are beyond amazing!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "My boyfriend and I tried this place out while we were in town. It's a small restaurant so accommodating a large group would be hard. I liked that we were instantly greeted and given a menu. Host gave some recommendations as we told him we were first-timers and I really appreciated that he tried to pronounce the dishes as accurately as he could. My boyfriend had the torta ahogada, I had the cubana, and we both had the agua de jamaica.<br><br>I was really satisfied with my torta. It was cheesy and the salsa had a great kick. The bacon in my torta was a little too thick for me but it definitely gave it a good additional flavor to it. I wished the torta bread was a little fluffier/softer because I have braces and it made it a little hard for me to chew on.  I hated the lack of dish they used for my torta. It came in a basket (like school cafeteria basket) and it looked awfully cheap compared to my boyfriend's dish that came in a nice plate. <br><br>My boyfriend said his torta ahogada was too salty. I didn't try it because I was really enjoying mine but I'm sure I would've have thought the same (my salt-tasting sensitivity is usually more delicate than his). He tried mine and he liked mine a lot more than his. <br><br>Their agua de jamaica was a little different than what we are used to (we're mexican) because the agua was mixed with lemonade. We both thought the agua de jamaica was wayyy too sweet and acidic! We had to water it down to be able to drink it.<br><br>We also ended up trying the churros and the hot chocolate. I was really expecting the hot chocolate to be the \"abuelita's\" hot chocolate mixture (to me, that is the traditional way to make mexican hot chocolate) and that is not what it was. We got the \"authentic hot chocolate\" and it was really hard too drink because it was so rich in chocolate. It reminded me of the hot chocolate that is served in Paris. We couldn't drink it because it was just way too much chocolate. My boyfriend thought the churros were amazing.

Of course, you can't come to Xoco without having their famous hot chocolate and churros, so I ordered just that. I prefer the hot chocolate with milk because it's so much richer than with water. The hot chocolate really is some of the best you will ever find, it's incredibly strong and rich. Still upset they don't make it with almond milk anymore though.

The shrimp and the muskiness of the goat cheese went so well with the garlic and chipotle sauce. It was with this sandwich the bread shined through, the bread just complimented the fillings so well with its crunch, softness and slight sweetness.<br><br>The star of the night though was the mexican soft serve vanilla with churros. The churros weren't overly sweet nor overly seasoned, it was a light dessert that was good by itself and went well with the ice cream. Though it was just soft serve the vanilla here isn't your run of the mill vanilla. It was much deeper and richer than the average vanilla.

I take orders seriously so even though my friend said she's eaten at XOCO before, I told to shut the f*ck up and take me there. This place is a hot spot, as it was packed but the lines move relatively quickly and the food comes out fast. The wait is worth it, my friends!<br><br>The way they run this place was odd to me at first but it works. You wait in line til it's your turn to order, pay and then are taken to your table where the food will come to you. Depending on your order, you can have some dishes come after others.  The seating area is not huge but can fit small and big groups (to an extent).<br><br>I ordered the Carnitas (pork carnitas, potato-masa dumplings, chayote, roasted serrano chile, greens, arugula, avocado) Meal in a Bowl. It was exactly what I needed on a cold, rainy day! It warmed my soul and made me do my little delicious wiggle. On the side, I got a cup of their Aztec (fresh-ground chocolate + water + chile + allspice). I love the combo of chocolate and spice as it is so I knew I was going to love this and I did. For those in the know, it's like having Green & Black's Maya Gold chocolate bar in a cup! My friend took a sip of this and was immediately jealous! My friend got the Vegetables Meal in a Bowl, which was just as delectable. <br><br>We decided to get dessert and try their Churros with a cup of their Mexican Vanilla Soft Serve for to dip it in. It's so nice, we had it TWICE.  We didn't want to go in line to order it again so they let us use the Take Out line instead - woo hoo! I'm not a huge fan of Churros but XOCO makes them perfectly. Just go and have it with the soft serve. Just go. Now!<br><br>I had hoped that we could return to XOCO for round 2 so I could try one of their Tortas, which my friend says are awesome but it was not meant to be.

However, I was with a large group and the manager did her best to accommodate us. It was DEFINITELY worth the wait. <br><br>I ordered two sandiwiches which I shared with a friend (i recommend you do the same). <br><br>1) Ahogada with the spicy salsa. This took quite a while to be served. Its a pork sandwich served in a bowl of tomato soup. It was incredibly delicious. The soup matched the falvors in the sandwich so well. Not something I would typically order, but it was so good, I was left salivating for more, even though I was so full. <br><br>2) Carne Asada: I ate this half as I waited for the Ahogada. Again, this sandwcih was incredible. The flanksteak was surprisingly tender and the chimichirri was on point. Perfect blend of spices and seasoning. <br><br>3) Chips and Salsa. The chips came with two types of salsa. Not chunky, but super smooth, almost watery. I love it this way. The red was wayyyy better than the green imo. I ended up pouring the red salso on my sandwich and the staff gladly brought some more. <br><br>4_ Chicharrones; Can't really go wrong with fried pork skin/fat. However, I will say the sauce they serve on this was REALLY hot. I like heat, but this was almost too much heat. <br><br>5) Churros. If you are sticking around for dessert, get the plain churros. They are good, and well plain. I ordered two of the peanut butter with chocolate ones and felt ripped off. Basically tey drizzle a little chocolate syrup on top of the plain churros and some crush peanuts. Definitely not worth the money they charge for them. but again the plain ones were good. <br><br>6) someone else at our table ordered the ice cream. I LOVE ice cream, but didnt order it cause iwas so full and well, it was very expensive for such a small portion. However, ......THIS WAS SOME OF THE BEST ICE CREAM I'VE EVER TASTED. It was incredible good, plain, vanilla ice cream. <br><br>all in all xoco is a five star win.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Great to dine in as a small group or solo.

My buddies and I arrived just before they started serving lunch at 11. I guess they know how awkward it is to transition from breakfast to lunch but they had a hostess guide us through the ordering process, which was a little complicated with all the separate bills for our one table. She also helped us navigate the small size of this location by getting us a large table in the back. <br><br>The slight complication was really a blip on my radar once we got to the food. Some highlights of XOCO included the churros (try using the very very thick and not-too-sweet aztec hot chocolate as a dipping sauce) and the Cochinita Pibil, a torta made with a crusty bread and really tender pork that walks the fine line between a mouthwatering punch of flavor and destroying your taste buds well. Side note: Do not take the cashier's warning lightly. The habanero sauce that comes with this torta is indeed really spicy. Also, the guacamole and chips sound simple but don't be deceived. It's creamy and flavorful without being too salty. Highly recommended.<br><br>I also had a chance to try the ahogada torta, which contained some really juicy carnitas but I didn't like that it was served already sitting in the tomato broth. There's no way you can eat the entire hefty sandwich before it gets way too soggy. Also, I'd recommend sticking with the tortas. I had a taste of the Pork Belly Vermicelli, which, while it had a very nicely done pork belly, was overwhelmed by the uber-limey broth. Also, I might be biased because I'm used to eating soup noodles with chopsticks but I found it really hard to eat this with a shallow spoon and fork.

Months later I have returned, and the quality of food has definitely not changed...if anything its gotten better! My first time there I had the pleasure of having not 1, but 2 tortas! I opted for the Ahogada and the Pepito. The Ahogada is definitely one of my favorites, if not THE favorite at Xoco. It is served in a bowl which the torta comes in, halved and stood upright. Consisting of pork carnitas, black beans, a tomato broth and spicy arbol chile sauce, you are in for a treat. Trust me when I say, you will be repeatedly dipping in this sauce! You have the option of getting it to taste (i.e. mild, spicy, super spicy), I got it very spicy =). <br><br>The Pepito is easily my 2nd favorite here at Xoco, but then again I have yet to sample the rest of the special menu during the week. <br>The Pepitos protein comes in the form of braised Tallgrass shortribs, caramelized onions, artisan Jack, black beans and pickled jalapenos. If that following rundown of accoutrement didnt get your mouth salivating, I dont know what will! Im glad I tried the both of these tortas!<br><br>On a side note, the Jamon torta is worth an honorable mention. Definitely get this w the fried egg! <br><br>On this particular pilgrimage however, I was joined by both my brothers and our friend, as we were in anticipation for some good eats. Having been there before, I assured the bunch that they were in for a treat. Walking through the front door, you could smell the wave of aroma coming through this establishment. Did I mention I saw Rick Bayless on this visit!?<br><br>This time, I chose the Cochinita Pibil (yes, only one torta this time). Which is suckling pig and achiote, black beans, pickled onion, and habanero. The habanero comes on the side in the form or a sauce. **WARNING** if you like spicy, then you will LOVE the habanero sauce! Be warned! My only gripe my first trip here was that the accompanying sauces were not hot enough...the habanero is HOT! I made the mistake of dipping my first bite of cochinita completely in the sauce and taking a bite....\"Whoo!\" wow. very hot stuff.<br><br>The house made chips and guac are definitely a must have as an accompanying side treat!<br><br>The real delight though for all of us came at the end of the meal...yup...CHURROS! My youngest brother who I know personally LOVES churros was super stoked to try them. After finishing our meals, the churros came down with their soft serve. GET the side of soft serve to dip your churros in, you will not be sorry! <br><br>There are a few other tortas I definitely want to try, but what really has my attention is their soups...they look massive and look equally as fulfilling as any of the tortas so Ill be sure to update my review after that. Also, they have a medley of hot chocolate drinks and sweet stuffs.<br><br>Cash/card is accepted and there is the occasional line so be prepared to wait 30/45 mins.

The \"vermicelli\" was something more like buckwheat noodles and not the typical white, thin noodles you would find in pho. It was cooked well and al dente. Awesome. I was a little surprised to see avocado in the soup! It worked well with the soup though.

The suckling pig was a little bland and didn't taste like any suckling pig I've ever had so that was a little disappointing.

At this rate, I'll be hitting up Frontera Grill and Topolobampo in no time.<br><br>For now, since we didn't have time to do a 1 1/2 hour wait for the Grill, we decided to take on XOCO. The blow-by-blow follows:<br><br>Iced chocolate -- the special of the summer... I think it's just cocoa powder boiled into water, steeped in peppermint grown on the roof, then poured over ice. The key is they use really good cocoa. It certainly had some texture to it, which was a plus in my book.<br><br>Ahomado -- a pork sandwich served in its own broth. I got the distinct impression that at twice the price, this would have been mindbendingly good, but I'll take this $8 any day. The bread was toasted nicely, and I even tolerated the raw onions, because everything was spiced well. No stale ingredients or lazy presentation here.<br><br>Top Chef Torta -- I honestly wondered why my wife got this, because it's lengua: beef tongue. Apparently, she didn't know that's what it was, so I benefitted a little bit. The chorizo gives it a big flavor kick, and it also comes with lettuce, tomatoes (I think) and its own green salsa. As usual, they toasted the bread just right. Excellent.<br><br>Lemonade -- My wife got this and I've been making it at home since then. Fresh lemons, of course, but there's a twist of lime in it too. (I add hearty amounts of sugar.)<br> <br>Churro with chocolate -- My wife described it as a cross between a donut and funnel cake. That sounds about right. Wonderfully sweet, balanced with cinnamon and served separately with Mexican (I presume... pretty safe since I've never tasted chocolate like this before) chocolate melted in a little cup. <br><br>Polvoron -- In the Philippines, or Daly City, California, depending on where you are, polvoron is a candy that's mostly flour, sometimes other ingredients (like chocolate powder or crackled rice) and butter. XOCO put the Goldlock's version to shame. Everything else I've ever had now reminds me of raw flour. XOCO toasts the flour and lightens up on the texture to ensure that you're not biting through something rock solid. Excellent.<br><br>I loved this place, and really wished for something like it closer to home. Service was decent, and it wasn't all that busy at the time we went.

Both were outstanding!!!  The homemade cilantro crema was rich, flavorful, and memorable.  What I liked about my torta was the thin cuts of meat, leaving the flavor to the mixture of all the ingredients, not just a pile of meat accompanied by the 'other stuff.'   We started with naked quacamole and chips (guacamole IS a food group in my world!). It was chunky, tasty, and easily dipped with the thick, homemade chips (some of the best we've had).  However, the amount of guac was rather small, just enough for the two of us, and pricey for its size.  If more than two in your party, definitely order two servings if you just can't live without it.   <br><br>Two days later, my husband suggested, \"Let's go back to Xoco.\"  Really? Excellent choice. The husband ordered his milanesa torta again, but this time, I went for the carnitas caldo (soup).  OMG!!!!!!! If I were stranded on an island and could have only one food, THIS would be it!  (Yes, even instead of guacamole.)  This 'meal-in-a-bowl' is fantastic: a light broth filled with spices, herbs, greens, and of course, carnitas, which were just the right amount of salty. As the soup sits before you, it continues to steam, which just deepens the flavors.  My husband laughed as I worked my way through the large bowl of 'delicious,' and kept talking about it even after we returned home from our vacation.  I've already searched the recipe online!     <br><br>Rick Bayless has three restaurants in Chicago, all in the same area, and each at a different price point.  I'm betting all offer the same amazing food! If you're in need of a meal in a casual setting, be sure to get to Xoco.  And if you'd rather order and pick it up, we noticed LOTS of people doing that.  Fantastico!  <br><br>Home now and ordering Rick's cookbooks online.... :)", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Mr. Bayless does it again.  And he didn't even have to resort to yelling like his brother does to get attention.<br><br>If you go during peak hours (lunch) you can expect a little bit of a wait, but it is WELL worth it.  Also, I heard that XOCO has begun to take online orders so that might expedite the process for the savvy foodie.<br><br>I had the Pork Belly Vermicelli which was done extremely well.  Belly was tender and the broth was nothing like your mother has ever made, yet twice as good as mom's home cooking.  <br><br>The seating can be somewhat cramped and not for the claustrophobic a there will almost always be a line.

Lots of Mexican restaurants don't make their salsa that good. My mom was a fan of the green salsa while I was a fan of the red. The torta was perfectly crunchy on the outside, full of flavor on the inside. Might have a little too much mayo for some people's palette, but it was JUST enough for me. I enjoyed every bite of it. I was surprised to see the pozole with a clear broth. Being Mexican, I normally make pozole with red chile. It was cool to see the pozole is made with chicken when it's normally made with pork. The broth tasted way too good to have been made with just chicken. I feel like the broth was made with pork for flavor and had chicken bits for added protein. I am not against pork, (I'm sure you can tell by me ordering the torta) and I make my pozole with chicken too. Squirt lots of like juice in there, throw in some of that fresh salsa for some spice, and you've got yourself a great soup on a cold day. I loved how much shredded cabbage was in there as well.

The restaurant was packed for lunch! And it was a random Friday afternoon! Me and my  mom had to wait at least 30 to 40 min to order! After being allowed to stare at the menu and all the food being cooked by an open fire, we knew exactly what we wanted when we got the counter.<br><br>Since we missed brunch, we ordered off the lunch menu which comprised mostly of tortas. We ordered one of the \"specials\" - the Shrimp and Bacalao ($11) and one off the \"regular\" menu - the Woodland Mushroom Torta ($9). The Bacalao Torta had huge chunks of bacalao and shrimp covered in a light tomato puree topped with olives and capers. It was paired with a green verde salsa that gave this sandwich a nice tang! Unfortunately the bread was a bit soggy from all the tomato sauce. The Mushroom Torta was EVEN better! It came with wood-roasted garlic mushrooms, goat cheese, black beans and arugula. Just the ingredients themselves gave this torta a nice flavor. This was paired with a rusty chipotle sauce, giving it a nice kick! The bread was also crispier on this torta since it wasn't weighed down by too much sauce.<br><br>Now on to the most important part of the meal - CHURROS!!! Ok, a little overpriced ($1.25) but welllll worth it! The churro was light and crispy - sugared juuuuust right :)  I saw a few people order 3 and I regretted not doing so! LOL! We also got a \"Almendrado\" ($3.25) - to share. This hot chocolate is made from real chocolate powder and almond milk. Really thick and creamy = absolutely HEAVENLY.<br><br>Overall, the food was great, but the wait was too long and the price a little too high for the tortas. The churros and hot chocolate on the other hand was well worth the 40 min wait! LOL..

The pork was smoked with red chilies and cooked with sweet pineapple. The sandwich was packed with lots of tender meat. It was so flavorful--sweet, spicy and savory all in one bite.

The bread here was spot on.<br><br>My friend ordered the seafood caldo. He gave it an enthusiastic thumbs-up and after the spoonful I tried, I'd have to agree.

The brownie was made with a hint of pasilla peppers, giving it a nice touch of heat that paired well with the sweet ice cream. We picked up some cookies for later, and they were all quite tasty too.<br><br>I was really impressed how smoothly things ran at XOCO. When we walked in, I was a little worried how things might go since they don't offer waiter service--would it be like a land grab in the wild, wild west?

What made this my favorite Mexican dish I've ever had outside of California, however, was that the whole combo of these two amazing meats, potatoes, avocado, and salsa verde. If they changed that avocado to guac, and added in some pico de gallo/salsa fresca, however, this would quickly be a contender even with SoCal caliber places.<br><br>Churros with Chocolate Shot for dipping: This is not your Costco or state fair churro. This is the original churro just like those I've had in Spain, seasoned with complex sugars and cinnamon, fried crispy on the outside and smooth on the inside, complete with thick melted chocolate for dunking. <br><br>Don't get turned off by the long wait, it is well worth the wait.

The wood-burning oven cooking technique works absolute magic for these tortas. <br>The crisp, crunchy bread contrasts beautifully with the textures of warm/oozy goat cheese and soft/juicy mushrooms. <br>--TOMATO BROTH. Order it on the side. Totally worth it. I preferred dippin' this torta into the tomato broth as opposed to the 3-chile salsa. The flavours in the tomato broth are simpler, yes, but eating the uber crunchy torta slightly softened by the tomato broth just felt like a match made in heaven.<br><br>Vegetables & Black Bean Caldo<br>[woodland mushrooms, zucchini, potato-masa dumplings, black bean broth, spinach, avocado, serrano chile]<br><br>--HEAT. Not temperature; spice. Not for the faint of heart! Next time I'm sick, <br>I'm heading straight for this soup. I'm sure it's capable of curing any illness. For real. <br>--SALTY.

So when I order a torta sans one ingredient (which I asked if they would even do, or if I should order something else) I expect it not to be on my torta at all. When it came out, the woman even confirmed- it was sans item. However, upon looking at my torta it appears that it had been pre-made and then the item had been scrapped off. Which isn't the same to me as not being on there, especially when said item was beans. So don't expect them to be fresh or made-to-order at all. <br><br>That being said, the prices were also steep for what you get.

We ended up ordering lots of food and spent $50 for the two of us. <br><br>You can't watch someone making churros and not want to eat them. The same goes for chocolate flan cake. That cake was amazing and it was the first thing we ate. Our chips and guacamole were really yummy too. The carnitas with pork and dumplings had a lot of spice to it and it was probably my favorite thing next to the chocolate flan cake. The suckling pig tortas were good and we dipped the leftover bread in the carnitas broth...I highly recommend doing that! The crispy gunthorp chicken in my Milanesa was yummy but the jalapenos in it were definitely packing a punch and I had to take a couple of them out.

SO good.<br><br>Best of all, I loved how all of the food ingredients were local; I like knowing where my food comes from!  It's pretty neat to know that the bread I was eating was from a small suburb close to where I grew up and the chicken I was eating was raised on an organic farm. Props to XOCO for using both local and organic foods. They also have a vegetable garden on the rooftop that supplies a lot of the ingredients.

(table-side)).  So for guacamole Xoco's was just okay, even by average standards.  The margarita was also  unfortunately just okay, even with fresh lime juice (it was premixed in house).

I just wanted to get some of the liquid chocolate with the homemade dulce de leche, which would be only 50 cents less than what I ordered.  This was not important to me but very important to the host who wanted to adjust my bill (very nice!).  I insisted that it wasn't necessary so in addition to the liquid love he delivered he also brought me a side of ice cream with blueberries and raspberries, yumm!  The chocolate was amazing.  I brought most of it back to the hotel with me as I was pretty full and put it in my coffee the next morning.  Uh, yeah, ridiculously amazing!  <br><br>All in all a good experience even if I wasn't absolutely impressed with everything.

So of course had to try XOCO as well. First time (yes, been here twice in 2 weeks, that tells you something), we brought a couple friends visiting from Ohio. To put it shortly (as if the star-rating didn't give it away) WE ALL LOVED IT. <br><br>Interesting set up, you come in, wait in line to order, but if you're eating-in, you have to way to receive a table number before you can order. That delays it sometimes if there aren't table free - but I do like this better than the alternative it could have been (standing with warm, delicious food, hovering over people in what would become a crowded area, cursing under your breath for people to leave). Both times we went, we were greeted by Max, he was like an all-around host/waiter/manager, telling you how things work, asking if you want a drink while you wait, answering questions, giving you your table, etc. He is very nice and gets 5 stars himself. As for the wait, we went on a Saturday around 7 p.m. and waiting 20-25 minutes, another day on a Tuesday same time, about a 10-15 min wait.<br><br>Now the food:<br>WOW! Foodgasms all around the first time. We loved the guac, they only do regular guac, but it was just so fresh and delicious - I wanted to bathe in it. Chips are fresh, and it comes with a bit of their verde/tomatillo and red sauce. I love gauc in general, so among 4 of us, we got 2 orders. I think it was just right. One of my friends wasn't a fan of guac (she has this thing about certain foods not being certain colors, i.e. no food should be blue so she doesn't like blueberries, ha). She tried the guac though and had to admit she really liked it, and continued to have more.<br><br>Main meal - I got the pepito, hubby had woodland mushroom torta (with jack cheese instead of goat since he doesn't like goat cheese) - he loved it, other friend got the Shortrib Red Chile Soup (meal in the bowl/caldo). I was skeptical at first, is soup a meal? But this was very large, and hearty. And my friend could not stop talking about how much she loved the broth - she would have also probably bathed in it (lots of that going on at this restaurant, apparently). My pepito was awesome, such great flavors, great meat, and that jack cheese is so good! <br><br>Dessert:<br>We go the churros with chocolate dipping sauce. Very good, the dipping sauce was a bit too dark choc. taste for me, but still loved the churro. They have other desserts that sound so good, can't wait to try them.<br><br>This was totally a 5 star experience. The 2nd time, it wasn't quite 5 stars, but not enough for me to change my rating. The guac was a 9.5/10 (instead of 15/10 the first time), but the chips were even better than the first time. I got the Cubana (torta from griddle), it's bigger than the regular torta.

I just forgot why I loved food and haven't really gotten the same pleasure from finding great dinning like I used to.<br><br>That changed last weekend.<br><br>I knew I wanted to hit up one of the Rick Bayless hot-spots, but Topolobampo was way too expensive, Frontera Grill had a line around the corner, and my GPS sent me everywhere but to Frontera Fresco. So I wandered over to XOCO.<br><br>The place itself is pretty unassuming. In all honesty, it looks like a nice chain restaurant, but just with a huge line. The ordering system is somewhat confusing, so here's the tip I couldn't find on Yelp: They'll come around asking for your party size and if it's for carry out. If you're in a small group (I was by myself) they'll skip you to this random cashier (letting you bypass the line) so you can order and sit down immediately. If you have a big group (and thus need to wait for a table) or if you're ordering to-go, you'll have to wait in that giant line.<br><br>And the food. I got chips and salsa, a drink, and the Ahogada.<br><br>Chips and Salsa:<br>Meh. Sure it was decent, but (oh please don't hurt me for saying this) it's about on par with decent chains like Chipotle. Also, the amount of salsa given is pretty small. And in those stupid little bowls that are too small for any normal sized chip to fit in. On the positive side, the amount of time you'll waste trying to scope those last few drops onto your chip will make it feel like your food came relatively fast.<br>Verdict: Unless you LOVE chips, I'd try something else<br><br>Ahogada:<br>THIS IS WHAT FOOD IS. This was messy, (I got it) spicy, and was as delicious as the Metra is inconsistent. It's basically a carnitas sandwich sitting face down in a bowl of spicy tomato broth. The broth just soaks through the bread, dissolving it in your mouth.<br><br>As that hot broth dripped down my hand and the spice burned my mouth I felt the kind of pure excitement to be eating this that I wanted to stop every person that balked at the long line and shout at them, \"THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN WAITING IN LINE FOR SUBPAR CARMEL POPCORN!\"<br><br>But alas, the line outside Garrett's was still too long.", "pics": null}}]}
