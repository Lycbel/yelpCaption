My sister went to pick up the cupcakes to bring to her co worker, and there were sprinkles on the cupcakes.

My sister is texting me during all this and trying to help her think through solutions. My sister asked Sweet Mandy B's if they could scrape off the frosting with sprinkles and re do the frosting.

It wasn't packed when I walked in but it got packed quickly. There were at least four people picking up cakes while I was in line so you know that it's a popular neighborhood spot. I ordered the peanut butter Rice Krispie treat, red velvet cupcake, magic cookie bar and two cups of coffee. I didn't eat everything, I had about one fourth of everything but let me just tell you, if I didn't have any self control, I would have eaten everything. To say it was delicious or scrumptious is an understatement, it is indescribable. The desserts were fresh, they literally melted in my mouth and they were rich in flavor. I was told by the employees that you couldn't go wrong with any cupcake you choose! My only complaint is that I sat down and had coffee and they served the sweets on a paper plate.

Their chocolate chip, MM cookies and scones were downright evil, in a good addictive way. The cookies triggered my need to immediately horde, hide, stash 'em for genuine selfish purposes.

I almost couldn't believe it. I ordered the biggest size round cake that feeds over 30 people and it was about $65. Not bad at all for professionally made cake that I knew would be delicious. The only thing was the ordering was too easy and I wondered for confirmation etc. I did call again the day before pick up to make sure they had my order.

However, there was no problem. I was just surprised they trusted people over the phone with order without at least partial payment.<br><br>When picking up the cake, it was easy inside. However, the street where they're located was super busy and there was hardly any parking. Plus, I forgot my phone. It was a hell of a time to coordinate with my sister in the car as I ran in to get the cake but since she couldn't park she had to circle the block. However, the traffic was so bad.

I better take care of the POS customers, because those calling in may or may not be a real sale.  Well, that's a pretty poor way to operate a business and that's just what she's doing.<br><br>To make this even more disheartening, after telling her all of this (how far I drove, the message I was told the day before and they never told me I could just order them and they'd make them), she only said 'sorry.. we're busy today'.  There was no heartfelt apology for what I went through by following their instructions.  No offer to make some for pickup later.  Not even the simplest of gestures.. offer me a cup of coffee for driving an hour (30 minutes each way) for nothing.  That's what took this business from a 1 star down to a zero.<br><br>Bottom line.. find another small business with better (overall) baked goods/desserts that actually cares about customers.  And, has a solid business plan to handle volumes.  This place definitely does NOT!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I have been eating at sweet Mandy bs for several years and it is absolutely amazing.

There were a lot of American treat standards, such as rice crispies, cupcakes, cake, pie, bars, and cookies. They even had smores! It was cool to see that variety that's not normally at a bakery. Conversely, they didn't have many French or European pastry options - I'm not even sure that they had bread. I was disappointed about that. <br><br>I got a peanut butter rice crispy treat. It was tasty, but very rich and very sugary.

I love cake with a burning passion and I'm not incredibly sensitive when it comes to tasting different cakes. But please, take my advice and DO NOT buy a cake from here unless you want to disappoint all of your guests. I took my chances because apparently their cupcakes are good and their other items are delicious but the cake was a complete disappointment!

I have to say that the whole cupcake phase is so widespread, especially with every cupcake shop being on Cupcake Wars, that they have lost their appeal. Add on the fact that cupcakes are not too hard to make, so unlike macarons, I don't see the value. I'm much more impressed by a good cake than a good cupcake.<br><br>I ordered: 1 chocolate cupcake with chocolate frosting, 1 chocolate chip cookie, and 1 snickerdoodle. The chocolate cupcake was good, but the cake part could have been more moist. The chocolate frosting was not too much, as evidenced by the fact that I didn't have to remove extra frosting. However, neither their frosting or their cupcake was their selling point for me. I definitely regretted ordering a side of vanilla frosting because I could do without it. <br><br>Their cookies were spot on, though. Of the two, I far preferred the snickerdoodle. This says a lot, as I usually lean towards chocolate chip. What made the snickerdoodle unique was that it wasn't too sweet at all. The cinnamon to sugar ratio seemed perfect, and nothing was too overpowering or overboard. Both cookies I tried had the perfect balance of crispy outer circle to soft inner circle. <br><br>Of the desserts I tried, Sweet Mandy B's definitely was not the best cupcake I've ever had.

But no problem- it was replaced and more care was taken on the next one to make sure it got to my mouth! <br><br>Their butter cream frosting comes in 10 flavors from the standards like chocolate and vanilla to the more interesting like caramel, peanut butter and mocha. And the cakes come in as many flavors with some more interesting ones being the snickerdoodle, banana chocolate chip and red velvet. <br><br>Their take out packaging ensures that my cupcakes or cakes get home safely unlike some bakeries that just toss them in a box. Much appreciated. And since I usually drive there- I am always happy to find street parking right in the area. Six cupcakes ran about $11 and the people behind the counter were friendly and accomodating.<br><br>Cupcakes for me take me back to a simpler time . . .a time of elementary school treats and friend's birthday parties.

I had been disappointed that they didn't have almond cake to taste that day, since it's my favorite. Sure enough, I called to come in and order the cake with my wedding planner, and they made a special batch of almond for me to try (divine).<br><br>As for the style, I wanted something fairly basic. Since we had a large dessert buffet, and I wanted a more petite look, we went with a two tiered cake, estimated to serve about 90 people (for a 160 person wedding). It was covered in white cream cheese frosting, kind of spackled on. We then added flowers via our florist. When we saw it on the wedding night, it was perfect.<br><br>The top tier was red velvet, and the bottom tier was half almond and half snickerdoodle cake, all with cream cheese frosting. We had been told that there is ALWAYS left over cake, and sure enough - ours was so delicious that we ran out! There were plenty of other desserts to supplement, but not everyone got the cake. <br><br>We got rave reviews. Couldn't be happier, and can't wait to see photos of it.

This is probably the BEST fruit pie I'd had ever had. Also, the peanut butter and jelly cupcakes were awesome!! Exactly what you would think they would taste like, the cake was airy and the frosting was light as well.<br><br>Honorable mentions are the banana chocolate cupcake, the carrot cupcake with cream cheese frosting, the flourless chocolate cake, and the frosted cinnamon roll. All were good, but not rushing back anytime soon to get these.<br><br>I actually thought the not-so-greats were the peanut butter cheesecake, the lemon and the orange creamsicle cupcakes. The PB cheesecake was not sweet and the texture was a bit mushy. The cupcakes were a little dry but the frostings were a little hard and a little too sugary and fake fruity tasting.  Next time I'll know to not get the fruity cupcakes. <br><br>Overall, I'm glad we got a chance to come here.  I'm definitely excited to try other pies so I'm sure we'll be back sometime really soon.

My other cake tasting was at Alliance Bakery, where I was charged $35 for I believe it was 4 very small slices of cake and 4 even smaller dollops of filling, which does not even begin to represent their menu of flavors. Sweet Mandy B's basically gave us 12 cupcakes at no charge so that we could try all of the flavors. This was not a matter of not being able to afford a $35 tasting. I consistently chose top rated vendors for my wedding and that $35 did not amount to even a drop in the bucket of my wedding costs.

REAL good. I will admit that my favorite cupcake joint in Chicago is Molly's but this comes in at a very VERY close second.

The frosting, plentiful and not too heavy (my cat thinks so too--I made the mistake of leaving some extras on a platter on the kitchen table and when I woke up the next morning one was missing all its frosting and my cat was running around jacked up on a sugar high).

It's just so great!<br><br>Walking into the shop is like walking into what I imagine walking into Candy Land might be like if it were more tastefully decorated. The walls are painted in cotton candy hues, the cases are stacked with cupcakes of various flavors and frosting colors. Cakes of different sizes fill in the spaces between the cupcakes. Free samples of cookies and bars are offered to you as you wait (and yes I shamefully take advantage of them at every visit). A separate case houses these cookies and bars and other various sweet treats that do not fall into the \"cake\" category (cup or otherwise). Their raspberry bars are divine. The lemon bars are nice and tart without being uncomfortably sour. Chocolate chip cookies are never a bad idea. I always go in for a pack of four cupcakes (two chocolate, two vanilla) and I inevitably end up leaving with a baggie of bars to eat in car on my way home. I just can't help it!<br><br>The line is usually pretty substantial but don't let that scare you away. The staff is nice and efficient. They move things along very quickly so you are not stuck waiting for a terribly long time.

They are a perfect portrait of a cupcake, but they fall into the \"home-made\" category more than an art form, which is verrrry important when you actually want to EAT something. <br>These cupcakes are great, no frills, just a great cupcake. Hope this helps if you are debating which cupcake place to go to!<br><br>p.s.

Actually, here's a better analogy: the staff reminded me of the Keebler elves producing cookies, except the staff are mostly women dressed in pastel jumpers and bandannas, and they were busy frosting the world's most addictive cupcakes. How addictive our they? I got some of the red velvet cream cheese frosting on my finger, licked it off because my friend wanted to take a picture of our group holding our cupcakes - and the three seconds in between said finger lick and said picture was almost too much to handle.<br><br>I don't know how Sweet Mandy B's does it. The cupcake tops have a nice crispness to them that meshes so well with the world's best frosting. It's truly a unique thing that you must try for yourself.<br><br>I was also bold in trying a non-cupcake item - an $8 candy apple! I was appalled that I spent so much on a candy apple, but it was huge and had caramel, chocolate and walnuts. It also lasted me for THREE DAYS so it was totally worth it. Actually, when I first bit into the apple, all I got was a 3/4 cm of candy in my mouth, not even scraping the surface of the apple. It's definitely an item to bring home, saw into with a good serrated knife, and enjoy in portions.<br><br>Also to your parents out there (or big kids at heart), Sweet Mandy B's is located nearly adjacent to the Oscar Meyer school playground.

There were at least 8 people working there, which really surprised me. Everyone was wearing a brightly-colored fabric headband (yes, even the male employee). I let the gal who greeted me know that I had an order to pick up, and sure enough my 400 mini cupcakes were ready to go. She packed them all into bags, and denied my offer to help.

Sure, it's sweet, so it is good for that reason alone.

I am sitting here staring at the other half trying to decide if it's worth another 1500 calories to eat the second half. I'll probably just go for the frosting and toss the cake.<br><br>The chocolate and vanilla mini cupcakes were better, but still nothing spectacular. I expected the cake in all three to be much more spongy and moist, but dryness prevailed. Sure, maybe the chocolate and vanilla ones were made yesterday since we ordered such mass quantity (which might attribute to the dryness), but the creamsicle had to have been fresh! I have made comparable cupcakes at home and eaten better cupcakes at places that don't even specialize in baked goods.<br><br>Surprisingly the two creamsicle cupcakes were only $4.29 total with tax.

You should not be able to feel the texture of the rice. The rice was not cooked long enough, it remained firm in the center of the grains.<br><br>Overall great treats except fo the rice pudding. One thing that I did not care for was that the prices were not displayed next to the name of the items. They were not displayed on the wall either. I know this is Lincoln Park, a place where people have money to burn whether its on their lattes from starbucks or treats from Mandy B's, but I still think prices should be displayed. It was frustrating not knowing how much of my groupon I had left to spend. However, I will admit, that the manager named Lane was very helpful when it came to notifying us of how much we were away from using the complete certificate amount found on our groupon. I will definitely go back here again. If it was not for the rice pudding and lack of visible prices, I would have given this place a 5. I took a half star off the rating for each con.

It was the perfect size!  The cake itself was adorable. It would have given Duff a run for his money. However, I had one knock on the taste of the cake. The cake was refrigerated prior to us picking it up.  Refrigeration in my opinion has an adverse effect on the quality of the cake.  It masks the flavor of the cake itself and makes it a bit too firm. This problem could have been easily solved with a few hours at room temp, but we didn't have that time.  I wonder if the state or city requires refrigeration because of the dairy in the butter cream?<br><br>I didn't personally pick up this cake, but I have been to Sweet Mandy B's and the interior is as cute as a button.  The decor looks like it was pulled from the pages of Martha Stewart Living and I mean that as a compliment.  The service has always been quick and friendly.  I like cake and butter cream.  I like them a lot!

Since then I have moved back to Texas and occasionally whoopie pie would sneak into my thoughts. Luckily this past weekend my husband and I had to go to Chicago for business. We happened to eat @ a restaurant around the corner on our last night so I thought, let's just walk by SMB's and see if it's open. It was! And it was after 9pm! I was in heaven.

I'm pretty sure I scared the employee bc. I let out a little scream... I started rambling on about how they were my fave and blah blah blah. Anyway... the whoopie pie still tastes exactly as i remember it. Pure bliss. In case you don't know what a whoopie pie is, it's basically 2 chocolate cookies that have a thicker cake consistency and then buttercream frosting in the middle with some sprinkles on top.

First of all, they taste like your mom used to make, although my mom never had a great variety of flavors like banana, orange cream, lemon, pumpkin and the ever elusive peanut butter and jelly! TRUST ME when i tell you that if you want the best cupcake you've ever tasted, call ahead and order a dozen PB&J cupcakes. Horde them all for yourself or bring them to your next dinner party. They are AMAZING!!! I go in about 5 times a month on weekday evenings or weekends during the day and have yet to see the PB&J on the shelf. I was told about them like \"animal style\" at In-N-Out. They are like an urban legend of deliciousness. Moving on, i've had every flavor they offer, from pumpkin and snickerdoodle to  plain old vanilla and chocolate and they are all amazing. These aren't the trendy $4 cupcakes you hear so much about now-a-days, these are down home old fashioned dessert type cupcakes. They are made on site and you can taste it. Much like jamba juice, when you walk in to the store you are greeted with the most overwhelming smell of fresh baked goods (squeezed juice in jamba's case). The cupcakes are perfectly moist and explode with great flavor when you eat them. The frosting to cake ratio is spot on and the cupcakes themselves look perfect! The best part of Sweet Mandy B's is you can also get cookies, pies, puddings, smores, and several other great tasting freshly baked treats during your visit so if cupcakes aren't your thing, make the trip for some other sweet morsel. I've NEVER been disappointed by anything at Sweet Mandy B's! I hate to sound corny, but compared to most bakeries in town, you really feel and taste the love in their desserts. And unlike most of their competition, they are reasonably priced. I stayed at DePaul an extra semester just so i could make the short trip there everyday!

I only have two complaints:<br><br>1) I wish they had a better store layout so it was easier to get in and out when it is crowded (which is all of the time) <br><br>and<br><br>2) They made a tasty but HORRIBLE looking cake for my son's first birthday and, as a result, I cried the entire day (it was his first birthday after all). The cake looked nothing like either the cake photo, the birthday party invitation, or the color-coded picture I drew of the cake I wanted...all of which were provided to them when I ordered the cake (yes, I drew a color-coded picture...it was my son's first birthday cake!). Plus, to add insult to injury, the cake cost a small fortune. And for those of you who are wondering, the cake was all boxed up when I arrived to pick it up one hour before the party and Sweet Mandy B's was a madhouse as usual so, no, I did not look at it to approve it when I picked it up but, even if I had, what could I have done at that point? And, yes, I did say it tasted good which I know is what matters most BUT IT WAS MY SON'S FIRST BIRTHDAY and it should have looked good, too.<br><br>I will never buy a custom cake from Sweet Mandy B's again (Angel Food Bakery on Montrose and Ashland did a much better job on my son's second birthday cake and they have good cupcakes, too) but I will still purchase baked goods from there when I am in Lincoln Park.

The cake is a little more dense than I would like on some of the offerings--the chocolate in particular--but not so dense as to make the cupcakes unenjoyable.

I can, however, unequivocally recommend the lemon and orange cupcakes.

Oh my goodness this place is like heaven on earth!! I have gone here several times and each time I do I am never disappointed.

My favorite item from here is the peanut butter rice krispie treat... my mouth is watering right now thinking about this... seriously so good. There are so many things to choose from and they do a good job of changing it up a bit all the time. There are the standards of course, but every time I've gone in there's been something new to try that I didn't see last time I was there... It's often busy and the space is a little tight between the counter and the tables but it is all worth it for even one little bite of the deliciousness that they provide!

Just the perfect balance of sugar, butter and vanilla.   I can't wait to try more treats at this little gem of a bakery, but I know I will never go wrong with a yellow cupcake (or 5)!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I tried various cupcakes and extremely in love with one and every.  The cupcakes were moist and the frosting not only looked great but were very tasty.  Both cake and frosting were sweet but not overtly sugary.  The place was very cool looking with ample seating and the staff rawks (made me feel cool that I was the only dude there).  The cupcakes easily made up for the walk from the Fullerton station in freezing weather.  In my opinion, Sweet Mandy B's has some of the best cupcakes I have ever sampled.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Absolutely LOVED this place!!

I however do not like the customer service that I experienced on Friday night, or lack there of, I should say. My husband ordered a banana chocolate cupcake, my daughter had a mini cupcake and I ordered a vanilla cupcake with chocolate frosting. We also got a snicker doodle cookie, in the event that my daughter wouldn't like the cupcake, I know~it's true that she doesn't really eat sweets and so a back up plan was in effect. Anyways, I was dying for a chocolate chocolate cupcake and \"missy blonde braided pigtails\" very non-apologetically informed me that they were out of chocolate chocolate cupcakes. I was bummed so I ordered the vanilla chocolate, no huge deal. She proceeded to try to find packing material to wrap them up and in the process moved a garbage can, whose liner fell off and she proceeded to fix. And then went right into gathering our order. GROSS. After that I decided no harm done the cakes are in wrappers and I just let it go. I did notice however that they had a full tray of chocolate chocolate cupcakes in the remodeled section of the bakery dessert case. I informed her, with glee and she then told me that \"they are just display cupcakes\". DISPLAY CUPCAKES? If you don't have them, then please don't display them! ***ALSO***There was an entire speed rack (bun rack) full of cupcakes, most likely for the next day, already in the rear of the store, but I could see that were were in fact chocolate chocolate on the rack! How rude that she couldn't retrieve a single cupcake for me to curb my craving! It was near closing and providing me the customer what I wanted, is the industry standard and it was a let down. Oh by the way the snicker doodles are mediocre at best.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "One star for poor customer service.   My 7 year old daughter was very excited about designing her own birthday cake this year.  We made a special trip into the bakery to check out the stock selections and then she decided.  I called in my order and then sent my husband to pick up the cake.  Needless to say, it was not what we were expecting and my daughter was very disappointed.  I promptly called the bakery to let them know that they had messed up on the design.  They looked up the order and admitted the mistake.  No apology.  The response I got back from the guy on the phone was \"well, your husband looked at it when he picked it up\".   This is true, my husband did look at it to make sure the name was correct, but he was unaware of the desired color scheme and decorations.  So, now my daughter is upset, my husband is angry and I'm frustrated.  They did offer to credit me for cake decorating charge.  Told them to save it and will take my business elsewhere in the future.", "pics": null}}]}}
