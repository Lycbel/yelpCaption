The menu is amazing, constantly changing and the food is superb. I have never been disappointed in anything I have ever gotten here.<br><br>Time and again I have gotten the chicken chilaquiles, and that make your own bar is totally worth it. Absolutely delicious with all the toppings you want and they don't hold back on the guac.<br><br>Also highly recommended is the quinoa burger, certainly very tasty. The party holds together well and the fries are a good side to accompany it. The waffles are pretty good and the strawberries are always tart. Ask them for a side of Nutella and you're in seventh heaven.<br><br>We've even ordered a few juices here time and again are those are pretty solid. Whenever I've gotten coffee for myself, the servers have always ensured that my cup is full.<br><br>I recommend making a reservation here though. The place is extremely popular and the waits can be painful, even if you have a reservation.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "My (now) wife and I planned our post-wedding brunch here, but Beatrix dropped the ball entirely. A reservation for a big group required a large deposit; around $6k I believe. Our exact numbers were a bit difficult to figure out in advance, so we reserved a table for twelve for us and the wedding party, and told interested guests to make their own reservations for the same time if they wanted to join. We called the restaurant in advance, described our plan, and told them we would prefer to all be seated near each other, but that we completely understood if it wasn't possible for a Saturday morning. The reservations made totaled approximately 40 people. <br><br>When we showed up, Beatrix had somehow \"lost\" most of the reservations, including our 12-person res for the wedding party, and our guests were left standing around confused and hungry. Eventually some went to other restaurants, others had to leave to get back to relieve babysitters watching their children at home, and while some waited it out, we all ended up in separate areas of the restaurant. We were eventually seated after waiting for 45 minutes to an hour.  And while the food was good, the staff offered no apology, and we had mediocre service at best having had to wait for almost 10 minutes after being seated for a waiter to serve us. This was really too bad, as I've had positive experiences for personal and professional meals here in the past. <br><br>While we understand mistakes happen, their response was sadly lacking. We just hope they learn from this poor experience and leave guests with a better stay in the future. Losing this quantity of confirmed reservations and not rushing those tables to be seated was an unfortunate end to an otherwise beautiful wedding experience.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I haven't had a full sit down meal here, but I sat at the bar a few weeks ago for some drinks with my brother and have to say I had one of the best bloody mary's I've ever had. It was the perfect amount of spice, tasted fresh, and had a piece of carmelized bacon on top- YUM. <br><br>I also ordered the caesar salad with chicken which was probably one of the best caesar salads I've ever had. It had breadcrumbs and capers on top, so all the salty good stuff. The restaurant was packed and it looks like a cozy place to hang out in cold weather!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "It just doesn't seem right to start a review talking about dessert but after trying the oh my! caramel pie, it definitely feels right! <br><br>Dessert was probably my favorite course at Beatrix and that slice of caramel pie and tall, dark and handsome chocolate cake had some stiff competition, which started with our first bites. <br><br>The appetizers were really good. We tried the tsukune, or Japanese chicken meatballs, which were tossed in a sweet sauce. This was my favorite bite of the night but the kung pao brussels sprouts and the enlightened caesar salad were excellent as well.<br><br>I tried the chili and chocolate glazed salmon, the chicken bebe, and the ricotta ravioli. I wanted to love the salmon because well let's face it, I love all things chocolate. But, the flavor really wasn't there. Adding the salsa verde and putting the fish on the accompanying tortillas didn't make this fish any more successful. It begged for some simple salt and pepper at least. What I did like however was the pounded thin chicken with a parmesan crust and a cream sauce. The pasta was also very tasty.<br><br>But, getting back to dessert...the caramel pie was divine. As someone who doesn't love many caramel concoctions, including caramel cake, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this pie. Perhaps it's because I've never had anything exactly like it. It was rich and gooey and absolutely delicious. It tasted like I was eating a massive piece of caramel candy. Despite my being stuffed after our entrees, that pie made me find a little more space to get it down. <br><br>Beatrix is definitely a cool spot that people can enjoy all day, starting at the coffee bar and pastry counter up front and ending, of course, with dessert.

The restaurant can get busy (always a good thing) but it never feels rushed or pushy like more popular brunch spots in Chicago. The food itself was great; I have 0 complaints on that front and the mimosa (or 2 or 3) that I had was standard fare. <br><br>Things I tried & liked:<br><br>Avocado Toast - Topped with fresh avocado, the light and airy bread pairs well with the grains and greens put on top. For those looking for a more citrusy avocado toast-- look elsewhere. Otherwise, definitely try this side!<br><br>House-Made Belgian Style Waffle - The name is a bit deceiving; you get 4 small waffles with a beautifully done, light sweet cream reminiscent of mascarpone. The waffles are topped with fresh strawberries and garnished with a small helping of mint leaves and syrup. The dish is great; everything pairs well and it's not too heavy. However, it is a relatively small portion so if you're in the mood for waffles/pancakes, then go for the lemon pancakes (which offer a larger portion size).<br><br>Light & Fluffy Lemon Pancakes - These are pretty straighforward. You get 2 light and fluffy lemon infused pancakes topped with powdered sugar, lemon zest, and blackberries. You get Beatrix's wonderful syrup on the side. They taste great (though a bit egg-y for my palette) and are filling without bloating you afterwards. <br><br>Mimosas - The mimosas are standard fare, though you can get them in orange, blue, or red. They're worth having, though I believe they'd be more fairly priced around $6 or $7 each.<br><br>Overall, Beatrix is a fantastic breakfast/brunch spot. While it may not be as popular as other restaurants, it's a welcome addition to the food scene in Chicago that doesn't have ridiculously long wait times.

I guess the staff immediately noticed our dissatisfaction and came over to explain that's how it is supposed to be...\"souffle like\". Maybe they should have said that on the menu, instead of describing the dish as \"fluffy\". Fluffy they were most definitely not.

One of the people with us went with the chicken tinga based on the waitress's recommendation, while myself and my friend both went for the steak and eggs. We both ordered our steaks medium rare and our eggs poached. The dish also came with toast and a hash brown. Our food came out pretty quickly. The girl who ordered the chicken tinga said it was \"just ok, not great\". Our steak and eggs on the other hand was a mess. Our toast was cold, which was confusing because it came out quickly so we didn't think it sat long. While we were waiting we did notice a table next to us touching each other's toast, so I assume other people had this issue. The hash browns were greasy and lacking any flavor. Both of our steaks were overcooked, more on the medium well side. Also, the eggs were a mess. They were served in a small bowl, like a teacup. They were clearly taken from the pot straight to the cup because they were sitting in a good amount of water, which, in itself was gross because when you went to put them on your plate it just made for a watery dish. Also, the poached eggs were overcooked to a medium/hard boil. We let our waitress know about our huge disappointment and she offered to have our eggs remade. That was nice, except they once again came out in a cup with a decent amount of water in the cup and our plates had been taken so our only option was to eat watery eggs. <br><br>Our waitress was great. She was attentive and checked on us regularly despite it being busy.

There was an angel food cake muffin, a type of coffee cake covered in icing and sliced almonds, and a blueberry muffin. All were truly fantastic - they tasted fresh, moist, and not overly sweet. I would definitely recommend checking out the pastry counter here.<br><br>Overall, I've come here and experienced a great meal with lacking service, and alternatively, great service and a severely lacking meal.

Two out of the three servers behind the bar really need a lesson in how to interact with customers. In particular, the young lady behind the bar acted as if I was bothering her to the worst degree when I asked for something as simple as ketchup. I try to avoid writing negative reviews, but a couple of the servers working the morning before Memorial Day behind the bar need lessons in not just customer service, but human interactions 101. I mean, if you dislike dealing with customers, why obtain a job in customer service?! Also, my breakfast was cold, and when I asked for ketchup, the server who brought me my food never came back with it after I asked him very politely if I could please have some ketchup. After waiting, I asked the young lady, who ignored me until after the eighth time asking. When I asked her nicely for some ketchup, she stated coldly \"Hold on,\" and after I proceeded to wait for several more minutes, she put out on the counter in a very rude manner a very, very small portion of ketchup (The couple  next to me even looked at me in semi-dismay on how I was being treated). I talked to the manager after my horrendous breakfast experience, and he was professional and apologetic, even giving me his business card, telling me to ask for him when I come back. However, I will not be back. I always tip 20% or more, and this was one of the first times I have not done so (I was a server, and do know how necessary tips are). I guess common sense manners, etc. do not apply towards obtaining a job at this establishment.

We each ordered a glass of wine, and I'd asked our friendly server not to rush the meal.  But after just a few sips of wine, the food arrived. My friend had just gotten back from a long trip, and I was looking forward to hearing about her adventures. Because she was doing most of the talking, I finished my meal before she did. Without asking, the busser took my plate away, even though my friend was only halfway through her kale. I saw this happening at other tables, too.<br><br>Note to Beatrix management: unless you're running a buffet, it's considered rude to clear the table until everyone has finished. When you do, those who eat fast feel awkward, and those who eat slowly feel pressured to eat faster and finish.  <br><br>What's more, our server didn't even wait until my friend was done before she offered us coffee and dessert.

The Spicy Chicken Tinga and side of Slider looking Chicken Sausages were fabulous. <br><br>Oh and if you're going to go down in flames and have dessert, the Sea Salt Carmel Pie is insane as is the Black Chocolate Truffle Pie. <br><br>One tip for the restaurant:  The menu doesn't tell you how many pieces of Deviled Eggs are in an order. It would be nice if we could order the Deviled Eggs by the piece, or state The number of eggs per plate (3) on the menu and perhaps offer an upcharge option for an addition egg.

I loved the mushroom burger because I didn't expect it to be so tasty and filling. I loved that the quinoa gave the burger its texture. If someone gave me the burger blindfolded, I would've thought I was eating an actual meat hamburger! My dad enjoyed his Prime Burger and fries as well.

The blue mimosa was interesting, it was freshly squeezed blueberry juice with champagne. I've only ever had citrusy flavored beverages for mimosas so it was definitely something different, in regardless good. The quinoa cakes were really delicious! The tomato-basil sauce tasted like it was marinara sauce, couldn't really taste the basil, none the less good a good pairing with the cakes and eggs. Ordered the kennebec fries as a side to share for the table. They were pretty crispy and a big helping, between the three of us we didn't finish it. It comes with what tasted like a mayo based sauce that had a lemon zing to it. There were also what appeared to look like deep fried lemon slices and bell peppers. It was interesting, but good. Lastly, ordered the caramel pie. It came highly recommended by my roommate, she was raving about it and I have to say she was right. SO GOOD! Perfectly sized and can be good for sharing or for one person. It came with a vanilla bean tasting whipped cream. The crust was perfect, had a crunch to it and stayed in tact when you were cutting pieces out of the pie slice.

So I tried and enjoyed that with my girls.<br><br>On the other hand with the dinner scene, reviews appear scarce. So I arrived Tuesday night with slight skepticism. The quick-and-easy? I left with a new love to add to my list. <br><br>First off, do something atypical and order a juice. Yes, it's dinner and you would like a douse of alcohol. Well, for just $6 more, you can turn that into a juice cocktail. I thought my blackberry and lychee lemonade was superb without the spike. Dinner mate across from me loved her virgin mango, orange, and pineapple nectar so much that she chugged two. <br><br>Onto the \"second\" course, we ordered the fries, hummus, tsukune, and straight A salad for sharing. Most of them were good for sharing except for the tsukune which are coarse-ground chicken meatballs that came in four pieces. We just wanted to give it a try so we sliced each piece into halves. Don't let the chili-cilantro sauce throw you off because it's just a baby spice. The straight A salad caught me off guard and swooned me. With arugula, avocado, Asian pear, asiago, and almond, this was easily a pleasant start for the evening. Coming from a person who usually shies away from ordering salad, I see myself re-ordering this upon my return. It was simplicity done at its best. <br><br>Main courses consisted of potato ravioli, pan-roasted sea bass, slow-braised short rib, skirt steak, and three caramelized pork shanks. It was a very lopsided party with lots of meat lovers. My short rib, ladled with balsamic steak sauce, was served in a rectangular block of lean meat with a thin layer of fat. Beneath the hot pile was a huge smear of mashed potatoes and on the side was a set of un-constructed salad with roasted romaine hearts and tomatoes. It was nothing complicated but everything that I wanted. The pork shank is huge with hints of fat scattered throughout, therefore it was especially tender and juicy. I liked it a little less than my short rib though. With the Michigan peaches, it was a tidbit sweet and I'm generally a savory person when it comes to entrees. <br><br>I must also note Beatrix takes pleasure in bringing out the dishes at the same time. Two of the pork shanks were cold at the first cut and bite. We brought it to our server's attention and she immediately apologized for the mishap. With no questions asked, she took the pork shanks away and returned 10 minutes later with a set of fresh-made, well-glazed, and sizzling pork shanks. Cheers to top-notch service! (And for this, I gave Beatrix an extra star, therefore capping it at five.)<br><br>Onto desserts, we skipped the pastry bar and focused on the menu offering. Among us, we shared the chia pudding, vanilla bean kulfi, and two slices of dark chocolate cake. Our server was kind enough to put a candle on the chocolate cake for our belated birthday boy. The cake was indeed as stated: tall, dark, and handsome. Dig your spoon deep into this flourless marvel of deliciousness and you will keep doing so until it's all gone. The kulfi, also known as Indian ice cream, is not to be neglected. The candied oranges and toasted pistachios were excellent complements. The ice cream itself is light by flavor but strong by physique. We almost resorted to using a steak knife to make it shareable. Nonetheless, I would order it and put my arms to work again. <br><br>All in all, Beatrix is casual and buzzy.

The chicken was anything except boring. Organic chicken parnesan crusted sometimes can be too dry or too oily.

Beatrix is now one of my favorite places to eat in this area. I came after a long week of work to enjoy Friday afternoon and was so happy with everything. We started off with a couple of juices. The cucumber and mint soda was super light and refreshing and the carrot, apple, and ginger snap was something I felt was innovative, healthy, and delicious at the same time. It leans heavier towards the carrot, about 50%, and then maybe 35% towards the ginger snap but then you also get hints of the apple too. Loved it! <br><br>We decided on sampling a few of their snacks since we had just recently finished lunch. The kennebec fries were great though I think I would have liked it with more potato inside the fries. My favorite part was actually the few slices of crispy lemons sprinkled on top and the delicious aioli with spices. The warm quinoa cakes were really delicious too - they were light, airy, and actually a great compliment to the heavier fries. My favorite snack was the tsukune (chicken meatball) with chili cilantro sauce. SO GOOD. YUMM! I wasn't able to taste the cilantro in the sauce so for those of you who have an aversion to cilantro, still give it a try! <br><br>I wasn't hungry enough to get a bigger entree except for a bite of the chili and chocolate glazed salmon but I totally have my eye out for the mushroom quinoa burger on the next visit! <br><br>Other non-food related points: The outside seating area is amazing on a nice low-wind day.

Caramel Pie is dreamy!!!  If heaven could be described in a forkful, you'd find it in this Caramel Pie.  Shortbread cookie crust... sweet buttery caramel... served with their homemade vanilla bean whip cream.  I would've skipped dinner to have the whole slice to myself.    We also had the Tall, Dark and Handsome Chocolate cake.  It's base is dark, flourless chocolate cake... topped with a chocolate mousse.  A bit more dense than a mousse I think.. sort of an in between and a ganache.  Superb!  The dark chocolate makes this rich dessert not so nauseatingly rich like milk chocolate could.  A perfect bite to cleanse the palate of your dinner.<br><br>Great food makes a good restaurant.  What makes a great restaurant is their service, and Beatrix really showcases how they take care of their guests.  You do feel like a guest, rather than any other bar patron.  Our server never rushed us along our meal, or forced the check upon us to get us out of our table.  The manager Steven also made a point to stop by our table and see how our meal was and made excellent recommendations on the dessert.  I thank him for my new vice; the Oh My!

The heavy usage of the word \"hella\" signifies that I am from Northern California, and it basically means \"extremely\" or a \"large amount/quantity\" of something. Now that the definition is out of the way, let's dive right in.<br><br>My coworker and I were staying at Aloft for a conference (I'll review Aloft equally high, but in a separate review), and part of our \"planning\" for our days included our nightly brainstorming sessions at the smaller bar. The idea is that one beer starts the creativity process, two beers is ideal to maximize the creativity, but you only get between 30-40 minutes after your second beer to make use of that creativity because after that time limit your creativity basically nosedives faster than a North Korean missile test.<br><br>The ultimate test of a good place is to answer the question, \"would you come back?\" The answer to which is a huge \"yes\". All the staff were hella awesome! You hear rumors of what to expect from Chicagoans like bluntness, or being so straight forward to the point of being perceived as rudeness, but those expectations couldn't have been more wrong! Everyone we met were amazing! Specific staff highlights include: <br><br>Joel at the bar who gave us some hella good recommendations on places to eat, including Beatrix for breakfast. We took his suggestion of the pot roast breakfast sandwich, which was freaking awesome (seriously, I'd consider coming back just for that sandwich if it weren't for the close to $2k plane flight). He also suggested the Italian beef sandwich at Portillo's (reviewed separately)... amazing! He also suggested Lou Malnati's as where the true Chicagoans go instead of the other place we were going to try... which was also spot on (in fact I'm on the plane back to Cali with half the pizza in my bag so we'll see how well it travels!). Those suggestions helped make our trip amazing! Plus the Bottom Up Wit by Revolution Brewing was awesome paired with the Kennebec Fries (super good! Who would have known that fried lemon slices would taste so good!)<br><br>Jen, as our waitress for breakfast, was quick, courteous, welcoming, an awesome conversationalist and pretty much made her way straight to our heart from the start but also got extra brownie points by grabbing us one of Beatrix's amazing pancakes to try (thanks again Jen!). Seriously, you've got to try the pancakes! They aren't the same consistency that I am used to on the west coast, but it was fantastic. Every time I ran into her after our breakfast she would greet me, ask how things were going, and generally be attentive.<br><br>In sum, what makes or breaks a good review is contingent on many factors but what you see repeated over and over again in a lot of negative reviews on Yelp is that service plays just as big (if not bigger) part in customer satisfaction. So if you are looking for the full service: an awesome meal, good selection of drinks, great atmosphere, fantastic service, and hella amazing people then look no further than Beatrix because they are the full package!<br><br>P.S.

I sincerely hope it wasn't placed there to make it look \"all natural.\" My boyfriend ordered a blackberry & lychee lemonade with vodka. Also banal.<br><br>The food: I really hope their first 30 days is a trial run deciding what works and doesn't work. We ordered kennebec fries with the soft poached egg mayo for a starter. The fries were... fries. It was barely enough for two people. The mayo was pretty good though; a slight lemon essence. All of us agreed there was no purpose for that poached egg in the middle of the fries. Did they put that there just to make it more exciting since a lot of people like eggs? It didn't contribute to the flavors anyway. We ordered the quinoa cakes. Boy those quinoa cakes were so small I'm pretty sure a child would still be starved after downing those. These weren't \"starters.\" These were hors d'oeuvres for a supermodels' party. The grape tomatoes were practically the same size as these cakes. <br><br>The chicken n pudding was probably my favorite of the three dishes. I liked the quiche-like leek bread pudding and the chicken was nicely fried, seasoned well, and boneless! I do wish the portion was larger. The poached farm egg & truffled pasta was cream sauce overkill. The brown butter asparagus was lovely, but that brown butter combined with the massive amount of thin parmesan shavings just made me feel gross after three bites. Flavors-wise it was good, but it was just too rich: egg yolk, cheese, cream sauce, brown butter, dense pasta... ooof! The chili & chocolate glazed salmon was alright. We agreed the salmon was a tad overcooked. The flavors were fine... the chocolate was very subtle. And while the presentation encouraged taco-making, the tortillas (again with their \"food accessories\") were out of place. <br><br>Desserts: there's a pastry and coffee bar. The pastries (though some looked good like the honey bran muffin and lemon sugar cookies) looked like something I could get at Panera. All desserts on the menu are gluten-free. We ordered the flour-less chocolate cake and chia seed pudding. I was ABSOLUTELY ready for this chia seed pudding after seeing a beautifully photographed presentation from the Yelp photos. When it came out, it looked nothing like the lovely photo. Instead, it looked like salsa verde with the texture of a poorly made tapioca pudding. It was just not very nice to look at... and the flavors didn't make up for its unappetizing presentation. I felt duped! The cake was fine and they used good quality chocolate. We also heard the table next to us complain about the cinnamon roll being dry which says something about their pastries lying out all day. <br><br>The bill: As you read earlier, they did not warn our friend of the $21 whiskey neat price. When he raised concerns to the server, she said \"Maybe because it's not on the rocks that's why it's more expensive?\" It's the same portion of whiskey whether or not it's on ice. Again, nice server, but that was absurd. They rightfully adjusted the cost knowing that was a bit obscene and mispriced. <br><br>Beatrix is wonderfully appointed (nice browns and tans on the furniture... green ferns... unique lighting...) and they opened the windows last night since its summer. But it was a little too chilly for them to do that. In sum, I hope others who try Beatrix find it more *positively* memorable than we did.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/L3HynqhKdB2GkwkD6Jdyqw/348s.jpg", "caption": "Side of hash browns"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ALbBd42TSyKIqKciK9xwRA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Short Rib Breakfast Sandwich on focaccia bread"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/w9ZcynTdUQ0D7vK-WJdbuA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Peach Waffles.

Hey cutie!<br><br>The brunch was to celebrate my impending relocation to California. I want to enjoy all of the places I've been meaning to visit before I have to leave. I ordered the pot roast and egg sandwich, which was genius. I can't believe I've never thought of making this at home, but I'm going to now. The ciabatta was warm and fluffy, the pot roast was flavorful and melted in your mouth. Damn it was good.<br><br>My girlfriend got the chilaquiles buffet bar and shared with the rest of the table. Tortilla chips, guac, chicken, egg, sour cream, cheese, all of the good fixins to cure any hangover. They were delicious and abundant. I need to implement a chilaquiles buffet in my own home every weekend, pretty much.<br><br>And our other friend ordered the Beatrix take on steak and eggs, which was also really good. All of the portion sizes were spot on. You didn't feel like a heifer after leaving the place. You just felt very satisfied. We also partook in some of the libations, including the red mimosa (with fresh pureed strawberry juice), the blue mimosa (with fresh pureed blueberry juice), the cherry mojito which tasted like an adult cherry limeade, and the tequila sunrise. <br><br>All in all, a very satisfying grown up brunch.

Complimentary pastries found their way to our table. Already, the service was excellent.<br><br>Eventually, about an hour after Beatrix opened, we were hungry and began to order. Most of us ordered mimosas, and their three mimosas they were offering were absolutely fantastic. Fresh squeezed valencia orange juice, strawberry juice, and blueberry juice combined with basil were the three juice options to be combined with their champagne. All three were absolutely fantastic and delicious (and they didn't skimp on the champagne).<br><br>Our server/waitress was very friendly and didn't seem bothered to talk to a somewhat buzzed to almost drunk party of eight. She was very knowledgeable about the menu, providing her personal recommendations and giving opinions on other dishes when asked. She also took a group photo for us. <br><br>I personally ordered their lemon pancakes. I don't recall the exact name of the dish but the result were these heavenly, light, mild pancakes that were filling yet not heavy in the stomach.

It can be a romantic setting for couples, a friendly setting for families, and a quiet respite for anyone who needs a cup of excellent coffee and their newspaper.

Hm, I think it's burrito-like. Noo, maybe like a stew? We debated this for quite a while and the mystery surrounding the answer made it so appealing that half of our party ordered it for brunch yesterday. I can officially tell you that a tinga is a Mexican dish with shredded chicken steeped in a red sauce, sometimes with vegetables (thanks Google!). And if you know me well enough, you know I love anything with a Mexican flare. Sadly, Beatrix's Spicy Chicken Tinga was a let down.<br><br>I was actually super excited to try Beatrix. One of my friends claims that it's her favorite brunch spot in the city and she's never tried anything she didn't like. Therefore, I knew I couldn't go wrong, or at least I thought not. We started with drinks - my friend and I each tried one of their fresh-squeezed juices. We ordered the Blue Boost and the Cherry Chia Cooler juices. Both of them were amazing. The Blue Boost was really unique and I would definitely try to recreate it at home. The Cherry Chia Cooler was also really good, but a little on the sweeter side. However, I will say that I think that they are awfully overpriced. Almost $7 for a small serving of juice? That's almost the price of an entree. Seriously tho - my entree was about $9 so the juice is pretty pricey in comparison.<br><br>The food itself is pretty average - nothing I would rave about, but nothing awful either. Just fine. The Spicy Chicken Tinga wasn't all that spicy at all and lacked flavor. Other people have also mentioned that the portions are pretty big, but I didn't feel that way at the end of the meal. I was sufficiently full, but not stuffed or overly full. We all seemed to feel fine about our selections - Quinoa Cakes & Poached Eggs and a gluten free sandwich on the brunch menu - but our sentences regarding the food would probably end with periods.

We let our server know there was glass in our water - she looked confused and then grabbed his glass and our bottle of water for the table and replaced it without saying much else.<br><br>I was really disappointed in her response - I believe that finding a shard of glass is a BIG deal.

That being said, a lot of the dishes sounded really good and we had a hard time choosing which is always a good sign. I went with the spicy chicken tikka at the recommendation of the waiter. It was kind of a spicy tomato broth with shredded chicken served with eggs and avocado on top with tortillas on the side to make tacos.

We are avid brunch-ers and do things a little differently in order to get the best/well rounded experience of each restaurant...we both got the iced Mexican Coffee to start and ordered the Light and Fluffy Lemon Pancakes to share.  Light and fluffy they were indeed. They had a great flavor, not too much lemon, and blended well with the fresh blackberries. The lemon syrup could of been a little thicker but other than that they were very good.  For our main dishes I ordered the Cauliflower Grits and Fried Egg and my husband ordered the Green Chili Enchiladas with a side of the hash browns...again, we shared.  Both dishes were great portions and had great flavors.  I am not one to usually order grits in any situation but I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor of the cauliflower and the texture. It also had Brussel sprouts which added to the dish and added some veggies to start the day (which is a win-win).  As for the Enchiladas, that was the dish of the day. It had a really unique spice to them with eggs, peppers, kale and two different types of cheeses topped with sour cream...delicious!  Our only feedback is the ends were a little over cooked causing it to be inedible for that part but we still devoured them. Overall the food would get four stars and we will definitely be back. <br><br>The final star for this review would go to our server and the overall customer experience.  To start, I was aware that we were next on the list and saw a table for two open right by the open windows. Having worked in the industry before as a server, I was reluctant to bother the already busy hostess but I requested to be seated in that spot and she kindly made a note for us to be seated there and we did, which greatly added to our first experience.  Next, our server Alyssa was the sweetest and again, made the experience very memorable. She recommended the lemon pancakes to us, which we do not regret, she was very accepting of our weird brunch style (ordering an appetizer for brunch...we know, it's weird but makes it epic) and the food came out quick and with a smile.  She checked up on us consistently and even chatted with us a bit as I am 7 months pregnant and my husband was wearing a \"Baby Daddy\" shirt...she gave us many compliments and even ended our stay with 2 free treats from the bakery.  Regardless of those treats, we will definitely be back and we look forward to sharing/indulging in the treats later with family.

Not a place for an intimate and romantic date, but a great place to socialize. <br>Definitely going back to try some other things.<br><br>PS. The avocado toast is totally overrated.

My favorite was the burrata, served with some multigrain chips, an olive tapenade and halved cherry tomatoes. It was very light and fluffy and the saltiness of the tapenade complemented it well. The tsukune was okay, but just a small portion--4 tiny meatballs for the 3 of us to share. Pretty tasty though I would not order it again. We ordered the crispy kale salad, which I thought would be entirely kale but turned out to be fried kale mixed with regular greens. It also had dates, pistachios and papayas. Great combo for a summer salad. My boyfriend got the burger and didn't share any of it. He even got a little mad when I stole a bite of his kale side to compare with mine...

I got the Ginger Snap with apple, carrot and ginger, while my friend got the Blueberry that had basil in it. My other friend got the espresso hot chocolate which looked like a dream!

The location is great in the River North neighborhood. One huge minus though is their pricing which is on the expensive side. I came here for breakfast twice. The first time I had two sunny side up eggs, hash browns, coffee, fruit, and a raspberry lemon muffin for about $23 pre-tip amount. I can understand the charge if I could later say the breakfast was absolutely great. But it was not great, it was good, but definitely not great. Another problem here is the working culture. The employees here overall are not friendly. Out of the several people I interacted with here on both visits only one young Hispanic waitress was friendly. It does not hurt employees to greet patrons with open arms and make them feel at home during their visit. Another pet peeve of mine is when the waitress places the bill on my table before I am done eating and tells me \"there is no rush\". If there truly was no rush, then, why place the bill on my table before I asked for it?  In addition, when I was there, the first time, the place was practically empty!  Would it have killed the waitress to wait till I was done eating? Was she too lazy to check on me later to see if I was truly done enjoying my breakfast? On my second visit is when I had the friendly waitress that was very nice. My complaint with this meal is the meal itself. I ordered chimichurri steak that did not taste like it had chimichurri on it. The steak was cooked perfectly but the sauce looked right but did not provide the zing that it should have. I have been eating chimichurri all of my life and know what it is supposed to taste like. The upside to this meal is the additional chocolate chip coffee cake which was actually very good. Great location, but only okay food.

They seemed to really like the Power Greens juice, which I thought was just okay. It was a little bland and tasted kind of like grass, which makes sense considering what was in it. I thought my juice was a bit sweet and the blueberry juice overpowered all the other flavors.

We then ordered the Poached Farm Egg & Truffled Pasta (if you read my last post and other reviews, you know my obsession with truffles!) It was good, but lacking the over vibrant truffle taste from last time and had more of an egg flavor. Still warm and satisfying on a cold night. My boyfriend ordered the new menu item, Crab Cakes. The plate has a nice size portion of crab cakes with lots of crab and veggies. He licked his plate clean.  <br><br>For having to endure the cold room, at the end of our meal our waitress brought two complementary pastries from their coffee bar!

Not too sweet and it didn't taste too carrot-heavy, which was my only fear when ordering! I loved the mix of apple and ginger - it was a good balance of all of the flavors.<br><br>The menu is arguably quite meat-heavy. Their brunch menu appears to have many more veg dishes, and I would be interested in coming back for that. Still, there was a pasta dish, a few vegetarian appetizers and a few veg salads. We split the burrata appetizer, which was served with an artichoke and edamame dip. The dip was fantastic, not oily and it had big chunks of artichoke in it. The crackers it came with tasted homemade and they gave us more at no extra charge. They almost had a pumpernickel/sesame feel to them. The special of the day was a quinoa cobb salad, featuring sweet potato, toasted sunflower seeds, kale and avocado, amongst other things. Basically no boring lettuce and all toppings is a perfect salad! Each vegetable was served in its own compartment of the dish for you to mix together. All together they were great and very filling. Not too heavy! We didn't have dessert but they did look delicious! <br><br>Service is the one thing that wasn't awesome. My brother said it's usually more spot-on. Our server was slow, didn't check on us, didn't give my dressing on the side as I asked for and seemed a bit off. She was friendly enough when she came over, but certainly made no effort to go out of her way.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Fantastic food, phenomenal service!<br><br>Cavatelli w/ slow-roasted veggies - Delicious, has a subtle kick to it, perfect vegas option<br><br>Brioche Crusted Branzino - 2nd best dish all night.

Some places drown salads in dressing but this salad was light and delicious. I also had the habanero pineapple margarita.

I was standing there with my wallet open and my purse open hoping to start putting things away so I could quickly clear space for the next customer like I usually do at Starbucks. I don't like to linger and hold up other customers. 45 seconds go by. Cashier finally hands back my card, bakery item and receipt with a pen for my signature all at once?  Within seconds and before I sign and hand back the merchant copy of the receipt, the cashier asks the woman next to me, \"What can I get for you Miss?\" The woman is covered by the bakery window so she has to lean over me to order. I ask the cashier if I can have 5 seconds at the register to finish signing the merchant copy of the receipt and put my credit card away that she held on to for so long. She appeared confused as if I should have ordered a coffee if I wanted the \"head start\" special.

Whether you're religious or just an optimistic American, it's always a good story. I had seen a demo once by a Beatrix chef at another location, and eaten the five star fruits of her labor. I had gone there for the first time for a weekday lunch and gave it three, because of a couple glaring holes in my experience. But a Saturday brunch with a good friend was a solid five stars.<br><br>It was a risky endeavor to return here, given that it was a special occasion and we were celebrating multiple occasions: my friend's new job, new apartment and upcoming birthday; and my belated birthday. A bottle of Champagne was in order as a liquid appetizer. My friend's egg white omelette, holding the  bacon so as not to sully her vegetarian principles, put a smile on her gorgeous face. My green chili enchiladas did the same, except to my average Joe--make that John--face. I love a good roasted poblano pepper, and though I'm not a fan at all of the food-hipster, trendy, really-a-nettlesome weed that is called kale, my bet that it would add nutrients with little of its toxic taste was a good one. While the poblanos, pepper-jack and Chihuahua were fighting the good fight with great taste, the star was the rich flavor of the green chili sauce that roped the flavors together like a suave Mexican cowboy at a tasteful rodeo. We also shared the avocado toast, which was served on hearty bread that complemented the creamy goodness of that smooth aphrodisiac. <br><br>My previous complaint about skimpy portions of beef on bun did not apply to this visit, and I had no problem with competition between hearing my companion and too-loud music. Part of this might have been because it was a perfectly gorgeous day, and the restaurants openness to the outdoors may have made the room less lively. Traffic noise was not a problem, despite the busy street outside. A good place to enjoy the outdoors without being on the street side tables.<br><br>We finished the meal with a couple of their unique coffees. My Greek-born, Aphrodite companion had the icy Freddo, to bring a flavor of home to her taste buds, and it was delicious. I tried the Nitro, which was a new taste sensation for me.<br><br>Our server was fantastic. He gave us good recommendations for our taste buds, and gave us a fascinating explanation of the coffee choices, moving from the beans to the preparation to the taste components. It was also the end of the rush, and he stopped to chat and despite in spite of his youth, he was erudite on a number of subjects, especially music, as he is has begun an interesting program in that art at Columbia College.

Things are meant to be ordered for one person and the portions are huge. The meatballs were good, the mushroom dish was amazing (I love mushrooms), caesar salad, predictable.The tuna tar tar was delicious but I feel as if every place offers that appetizer. I had the sea bass which wasn't prepared the best, it was not nearly as delicate as I thought it was going to be, much more on the tough side.

Hummus arrives and it is pita not naan, and the 3 specks of cucumbers are mixed into a tomato and onion salad (I do not eat raw tomato's or onions, it would have been nice to know).

Served with avocado, sunny side up eggs and tortillas for the best freaking brunch ever. Portion size is also huge.<br>- Lemon pancakes - second favorite. The pancakes are refreshingly lemony without being too sour or overpowering. Ridiculously fluffy and moist.<br>- Pot roast sandwich - I asked for my eggs to be over easy instead of the omelet style it comes in. The meat is fantastic, only thing that wasn't the best was the bread (a little stale).<br>- Enchiladas - filled with scrambled eggs and kale, these were quite good but a bit bland compared to the spicy chicken tinga (obviously). We ended up mixing the two dishes together for the perfect mexican breakfast.<br>- Poached eggs with quinoa cakes - I was most excited for this dish and it definitely lived up to expectations, except the marinara sauce it's served with is super unnecessary and changes the entire flavor of the dish.

This place should inspire other neighborhoods to have a similar place for its quick order to go coffee and breakfast to the fast one hour lunches to the lively causal dinners. Did I mention that Beatrix is Aloft Chicago's hotel restaurant? Maybe other hotels across this country should take some inspiration as well. Their coffee bar is made from one of the two best Chicago coffee roasters: Intelligentsia and Metropolis. Their daily freshly baked pastries should keep the likes of Panera Bread and (former Lettuce Entertain You brand) Corner Bakery on their toes. Lunch has been great every time plus they seem to know I am always there bringing clients and co-workers by making sure I keep my lunches within an hour. I never feel pressured or rushed at any moment. If you go there as much as I have, you should see slight changes of their menu due to new menu items to what is fresh at the time. I have had their Three Grain & Arugula Salad with Miller Farm's Chicken, Pot Roast Sandwich, and Prime Burger. Their freshly made juices from fresh fruits and vegetables is a must. Even in the middle of a cold Chicago winter, you will feel like you just were transported to warm summer day in Chicago with their cool refreshing juices. For dinner, this place becomes a relaxing casual place and this is when the wine bar opens up with their sample selection that feels like it was stolen from the wine cellars of Wildfire. Their Caramelized Pork Shank and Chili & Chocolate Glazed Salmon are amazing. The service has been amazing through and through. So why the knock on service? I have tried many times to setup an event as small as 16 people and they seem to not want the business. I have reached out to Events Manager directly and thy failed to get back to me in a reasonable time. I have even dined and asked for that person. I would be told they were there but they never stop by my table to speak to me. This is where they forced me to take some of my small events to other places like The Pump Room. The serving staff and food will keep my coming by with small company. So for parties, steer clear. From clients to dates, this place is made for it. Get a working lunch done. Come back for after work drinks. Then come back once more to have your dinner date.

Goal! I went with other Yelpers/foodies and we all kind of had a similar consensus. We all loved the fact that the food was sourced and prepared healthy yet so deliciously! However we left on a down note, when they didn't offer to rectify a food sanitation issue any further than simply remaking the dish.<br><br>Right on par with the healthy theme is the decor which is fresh, young and hip, with earthy tones of brown and green complimented by wood furnishings, lots of curvy surfaces, with an upscale cafe type feel. The windows were open that evening and it was really nice! There are parts of the space where you can just pony up and get a beer and then there are parts like where we sat in the main dining room where it feels like a proper format for a real sit-down meal with friends.<br><br>Our server was fantastic. She knew the menu inside and out despite only having been open for 2 days, and made great recommendations. She was attentive, kind, and patient while we ordered dishes ala carte in succession but not all at once.<br><br>We split the following dishes amongst us:<br><br>1. Kennebec Fries with soft poached egg mayo<br>These were like normal fries with a poached egg, nothing special. It kind of lacked flavor. Honestly, I wouldn't waste your time or money with this dish, they're just fries.<br><br>2. Tsukune chicken meatballs with a chili-cilantro sauce<br>These are so delicious! Me and my fellow diners are Indian and agreed it tasted very Indo-Chinese inspired. It's a bit on the ginger-y side but it's not too overpowering. Definitely one of our favorites! And you get 4 for $7.50 so it's a pretty good deal and easy to share.<br><br>3. Poached Farm Egg & Truffled Pasta - rustic road farm egg, brown butter asparagus, parmesan<br>This was my personal favorite. It's kind of like one big 4in. x 4in. ravioli stuffed with gooey egg that spills out once you cut it, mixes with the butter and parmesan and it just so creamy, smooth, and delicious! A must try! I'm craving this one again already!<br><br>4. Stuffed Vegetable Peppers - stuffed with quinoa, a bit of cheese, and maybe some other things<br>Once we finally got it, it was a nice dish to finish off on. There are 2 red peppers and 1 green pepper stuffed that come with this plate, so very filling.<br><br>Unfortunately the first time we got it there was a hair on the dish. They apologized, brought the manager who took it away, but then took a long time to bring out another. Despite causing us a delay (to say the least, I mean a LONG HAIR, yuck!), and major error on their part, they didn't do nor even offer anything to make up for their shortcoming.<br><br>We all agreed without question that that was not OK, and really to be frowned upon, especially having been open only 2 days. The only other real problem with the service was that if you ordered a beer, it took way too long to come out (~10 minutes), so they need to work that out.

My dining partner  decided to go sweet with her dish, getting the lemon-ricotta pancakes.  These were some of the best 'cakes I've had in the city - again, nothing fancy, just perfectly cooked, they had a nice fluffiness to them and the right amount of lemon made them flavorful without being overpowering.<br><br>Pretty stuffed at this point, the staff decided to send over some extra pastries to try out - you know, since we may be hosting an event here this summer.  The pastry bar at Beatrix is pretty impressive and if you're in the area in the morning and need a quick bite, I'd recommend stopping here over a Starbuck's or Caribou...<br><br>I posted this on my blog - <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Featinginchicago2014.wordpress.com%2F&s=aa4e11bc08e8c841343be83d225f4c98e04035473ce010564d3a82e9d3d89382\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">eatinginchicago2014.word…</a> - check it out!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Absolutely wonderful. <br><br>I was in Chicago for work and was looking for a place to dine for 1.

Their menu is small but their gluten free menu represents a good number of the dishes on the regular menu. For the entree we ended up splitting the Chicken Bebe and the Prime Burger. The chicken was amazing but very very rich and there were not many vegetables to cut that richness, it is served with 4-5 asparagus stalks so I was glad I was sharing.

I went with four of my friends for Saturday brunch. Our waiter came by and took our drink orders while we waited for the last two people in our party of five. I got the watermelon strawberry juice and an iced coffee. Both were delicious. The menu is small, but has basically everything you would want for brunch.

I don't really remember waiting for our food because I was enjoying my drinks, but I can't imagine it taking too long. When placed on the table, every dish was hot and looked mouth watering. Even the vanilla greek yogurt with granola and berries had a gourmet touch. I got the light and fluffy lemon pancakes with blackberries. They were indeed light and fluffy. Each of the three cakes in my order, not bigger than the length of a dollar bill, were not overly filling like typical pancakes are. I had plenty of room for my side of brown sugar bacon and a bite of each of my friend's meals. For my second visit, I would definitely get the poached eggs on quinoa cakes. My bite of the dish had great texture with the salty quinoa and the eggs were perfectly runny. And I don't usually like runny eggs. <br><br>The thing that allows my review to have 5 stars is the service. The waiter was knowledgable of the whole menu, let us taste one of the vegetable juices, checked on us often but not to the point of being obnoxious, and when my friend's dish showed up not even five minutes later than the rest of ours, it was comped from our bill. Then on our way out, we stopped at the pastry bar, obviously. My friend couldn't decide which muffin and cookie to get. We took the manager's recommendations, and then he told us one of them was on the house! Two pastries for the price of one! <br><br>I will definitely come back here.

He explained it as a layer of pasta with egg on top plus another layer of pasta on top. I'm thinking like a bowl of creamy pasta or a mostaccioli dish.<br><br> No. This was a sheet of lasagna type pasta topped by two eggs with another thin strip of the lasagna pasta on top. Not mixed together at all. The sauce is oily, not creamy, so it slides right off the pasta.  Cheese is congealed on the ends of asparagus (no tips) and not part of the pasta dish. This was the worst meal I've eaten in a very long time, especially at what I thought was a nice restaurant. I cannot believe they would serve something that is so poorly conceptualized. Even the nice poaching of the eggs could not save a dish that simply makes no sense, particularly when it was described as something else. And The waiter did nothing about it. I would not recommend it.  I will not be coming back.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This place is incredible!  Visited Chicago over a long weekend and my husband and I kept going back.  Good service, nice ambiance, delicious food.  Had their waffles and enchiladas - both amazing!!  Needed to have an entree tweaked due to dietary restriction and they were so kind and took great care of us.  Would highly recommend!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Loved this place!  My husband and I met a friend here for breakfast while visiting Chicago.  It was amazing!  He had the lemon pancakes and I had the egg white omelette.  Definitely my favorite breakfast we had in the city.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Loved this place!

SERVICE 5 stars!<br><br>2)  the food...every guest i've ever brought to Beatrix has walked away with nothing but the greatest things to say about the dishes, but i'll always give my honest \"opinion\". i believe their staple dishes are excellent, but when it comes to \"specials\", i've had a few misses...one dish i'll mention is a \"pho\" dish (a vietnamese noodle soup dish) the chef created when it was a bit chilly outside. the thought and idea behind the dish was great, but the dish itself unfortunately fell short. but, that being said, i still enjoy myself there at least once a week. FOOD 4.5 stars!<br><br>3)  the ambiance is a big WoW. regardless if you're there for a drink, a quick bite, a meeting, operation stuff your face...there's a spot to accommodate all. i'm a big nut for space design...and all the details have been thought of. i imaging meeting the designer one day, he/she will be wearing a simple t-shirt with the words \"bus driver\" written across the front. i'll wonder what that's all about...and BAM--he/she will say, \"i just took ya to school!\". you'll have to experience the space for yourself. i don't want to ruin anyone's experience. AMBIANCE 5 stars!<br><br>4)  the pricing...i don't have any magical formula for this. it's more of a feeling. when you take in everything you've experienced and enjoyed or haven't enjoyed and the check arrives...that moment, the moment the total appears before you...is there any sort of a shock factor, or are you at peace? Beatrix nails it. it's definitely not inexpensive, but after one great thing after another...pricing is definitely inline. PRICING 5 stars!<br><br>so, taking all of this into consideration and using my elementary math, Beatrix should receive 4.875 stars, but since that's not an option...i've rounded up.<br><br>Beatrix...you have a great establishment.

We were sat at a communal table which I do not mind but kind of weird when we had a reservation and there were plenty of open tables...thought they would put walk in's here. <br>Our apps were awesome....tsukune...which are an asian chicken meatball with a savory sauce...well done and tasty. The hamachi crudo was also perfect although the portion was small for I think 14 dollars. <br>We ordered a bottle, then another of a house red which was way overpriced for this type of place, sells wholesale for around 10 dollars and on the menu for $45....not a lot of thought spent to the variety and pricing of the wine list, surprising for a Lettuce place. Maybe they miss Alpana already. We ordered entrees and there was a long lag before we got them...maybe 40 minutes. One ordered the prime burger...and it was your typical upscale burger, cooked to temp. The fresh cut fries that came with looked and tasted like they had been sitting for a while, not hot of crisp and most little pieces. My birde ordered the skirt steak chimichurri....it sure did not look or taste like skirt, more like flank steak. It was not bad, but if this was skirt, I have never seen it this thick or texture. The chimichurri was not on the plate but I guess they call shishito pepppers the same thing? Weird. I had the Soy and Ginger Carmelized Pork Shoulder. It had great flavors, very tender, but the portion was incredibly small. There were about 5-6 small chunks of pork accompanied by no more than two tablespoons of mashed potatoes! The flavors were spot on but for $20...they could have at least double or even tripled the portion size and still kept their food cost in line. Maybe it was a kitchen mistake but pork shoulder is one of the most economical cuts of protein and mashed taters are very low cost. <br><br>One of my pet peeves is to see a handful of managers and the young GM walking all around the place, and not once did I see them approach a table of diners. Are they afraid of hearing something negative? I would have gladly given them some insight but they were too busy looking busy to really seem like they cared. There are other great operators in the city who take a much different approach and think they are missing the boat here. <br>Would I go back? Maybe to sit at the bar for a drink and apps but I think they have designed this to cater to the three new hotels on the block and will probably succeed given the traffic. <br>I really wanted to like it more and maybe they can turn it around but they need to look closely at the details and price points to get my business.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This place is great!

Excellent atmosphere, good music and a bakery that is worth the trip alone.  Special shout out to Anthony - go bears!!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Good, the three grain chicken salad was wonderful.  The burger was a good burger!  Service was good, but the noise a bit much!!!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I just went to Beatrix for a work team lunch and it was excellent. We went to celebrate the completion of a big project and I was at first worried that Beatrix was too healthy and not hearty enough for such an event (I contemplated switching the reservations just the day before to a steak place). Healthier it was but it was also extremely hearty as you pretty much had to roll us out of there due to devouring all of our food. All 8 of us really enjoyed it and we all took advantage of the restaurant week menus. A couple of the people at our table got the neatloaf and all I can say is that I saw some members of the clean plate club. I could not finish my dish, the pot roast sandwich, but only because I was getting so full and wanted to save some room for dessert (caramel pie which was so rich and so yummy). Definitely interested in coming back their dinner and having some of their cocktails.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "We found a great, new hangout in Beatrix! We had friends visiting and chose this location because it was attached to their hotel, Aloft, AND a NEW LEYE restaurant. As a hotel restaurant, we knew this would be different. <br>We started with house coffee, Bloody Marys and mimosas. (The Bloody Mary was delicious and well made.) We then sat for a good 30 minutes before ordering, catching up, and never felt rushed by our server, who was attentive and understanding . When we were ready she was very knowledgeable about the menu. We tried several plates of the turkey bacon and potato salad deviled eggs. The deviled eggs were amazing, seasoned with their window garden herbs. For the main course, I asked for some suggestions and was guided to the steak chimichurri with eggs. It was delicious and the eggs and steak were both cooked perfectly to order. Two of my friends had the house-made Belgian waffles, one had the prime burger, and the other had the egg white omelet which, for a healthy choice that I don't usually go for, looked amazing. Everyone was very pleased! <br>For dessert, we ordered several items to share; the tall, dark & handsome chocolate cake (what a great name), the caramel pie, and some house-made cookies from the pastry bar. Needless to say, nothing was left on any of the shared plates!<br>So far we've only eaten from the Sunday Brunch menu but we are really looking forward to enjoying other meals there as well.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I came to check out this newish place recently for date night and it did not disappoint. The atmosphere had quite the buzz and the service was excellent. Our waiter was really helpful in helping me pick out a drink from their list of unique mixed drinks and my date was happy to have a few local craft brews to choose from.... I had the Bluberry Tom Collins...it was excellent!  For the dinner I had the neatloaf  and my date had the truffle pasta... Both really good ... I appreciated that the neatloaf was made with Turkey rather then beef, a good switch for the health conscious eater. We will be coming back!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I ate here last week with a friend who was in from out of town and staying at the Aloft hotel.  I checked yelp for nearby places and this sounded good; we didn't realize it was the hotel restaurant until we got there -  you'd never guess that from the food.  Everything was spectacular from the hip vibe to our uber knowledgeable server Neil, to the food itself. After ordering a lemon drop martini and a Chicago brewed stout to drink, we started off with beet carpaccio and the famous deviled eggs, both dishes excellent in their own genres.  For the main course my friend got the caramelized pork shank and I got the chocolate chile salmon.  Each so delicious, the salmon came with mini corn (thank you!) tortillas, slaw and salsa to make exquisite fish tacos.  Not a desert person, I gave in to the suggestion of caramel pie and let me just say that for the first time I think I understand what people mean when they say sex is overrated.  It was THAT good...  My friend got the chia coconut pudding which was probably a less guilty choice but still flavorfully decadent.  We'll definitely return, would like to try the fresh juices with a choice of added alcohol next time.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Several months ago I had  lunch with friends from kindergarten at Beatrix.  We have been friends for 50 years.  It was a special day and we had an awesome time at Beatrix.  I wanted to get together with my friend who is sick and gave her 3 choices and she wanted to experience Beatrix.  I made an open table reservation and needed to extend the reservation by 15 min.  I called and the hostess was so nice.  When we arrived our server was John  was amazing.  I didn't want to rush the evening because I wanted to spend as much time with my friend.  We had a situation with the Valet.  I spoke to CANNON and she spoke to the valet.  They could not do anything,so she spoke to the hotel and CANNON informed us everything was alright.  My friend was very upset and started to tell CANNON this was unacceptable but CANNON remained very calm and professional.  I am not sure if CANNON Is the manager, but WOW she sure needs to be thanked from the management.  I will definitely be dining at this restaurant again in the future.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "i really liked this place and can't wait to come back. i had lunch with work mates on a weekday afternoon. it was crowded for a late 130pm lunch. our waiter was super cool who made great recommendations so much that it made it difficult for me to decide. so i went for the sangria rather than juice and i had not doubt that i wanted the poached farm egg with truffle pasta and brussel sprouts and butternut squash. i am proud to say i was a member of the clean plate club! i hope i go back soon to try their pastries or brunch or another lunch!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Summer comfort food is the best way to describe their menu. The potato salad devilled eggs were a good way to begin our meal, but, they could have used a bit of a kick of flavor and color on the plate. My halibut was perfectly cooked although I think the creamy corn remoulade was too heavy of a sauce to dress the light summer fish. My dinner companion received her plate and bit into cold meat, unfortunately. They did re-fire her chimichurri skirt steak, and, she reported the wait being worth it. The server took it upon herself to bring complimentary dessert which was generous and very sweet. The strange part was she showed up with two bland, neutral colored breakfast pastries. We didn't need the \"apology\" dessert, but, if a restaurant is going to do it, they should present an actual sweet treat especially when they have a bakery on site. I may go back at some point to try their brunch, but, I might wait till they get it together.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I went to Beatrix today for Brunch with my wife. The service was very good and food was well presented but when my wife cut into her poached eggs she noticed that they were slightly overcooked, being British we were hesitant to complain but decided we would point it out when the waitress asked how our food was. When the waitress came and asked we said everything was nice but pointed out the eggs. She then  apologized and went to get the order redone. The replacement dish came out about 5 minutes later and the eggs were cooked perfectly. The manager also came over to apologize and once we had finished our brunch the waitress asked us if all was ok and informed us that our entire check had been settled. I had expected maybe a discount for my wife's meal. The manager also came over about 5 minutes later and brought us complimentary cookie and banana bread to make up for the earlier mistake, both of which were delicious. The way they handled this very minor complaint was outstanding and although ideally you would not haven anything to complain about I think the attitude is exactly what is needed for a new restaurant. My food was very good no complaints. We will definitely be going back", "pics": null}}]}}
