Unlike other popular styles of BBQ, the meat here do not come off the bone completely, which I learned that the chefs have done intentionally to give the meat more texture. <br><br>Their briskets: Texas-style and by far my personal favorite thing to order here.

Most BBQ places we've been to (most of them highly-rated in Yelp), do not serve you any meat with the smoke ring. The smoke ring is a sign that the meat has been smoked properly. Also, most BBQ places do not inject their pulled pork. So, if the BBQ restaurant is not smoking the pulled pork for 6-14 hours, do not add additional rub to the pulled pork, and/or do not inject their pulled pork with marinade, you will end up with bland pork. My husband & I have just smoked pork during July 4th...we will eventually become BBQ Smoking ninjas. :)<br><br>Cornbread: Basic. *sigh*<br><br>Brisket: Boring. It was a bit dry. According to their website, \"The deep, rich smoke flavor is complemented by a 2-layer spice rub.\" Sorry, but, there was absolutely no spice rub or smoke flavor in the 1/2 lb to 1 lb of brisket that I had.

Included with the order were 3 types of sauce (Memphis style, Spicy Memphis style, Carolina style). The Spicy Memphis was my favorite -- I dipped everything in it! While the four of us were able to finish everything, we were absolutely STUFFED. We probably should have gotten one less side and stuck with 1 lb of brisket.<br><br>I thought the brisket was the star of the show. It was super tender and juicy and tasted amazing with any of the sauces. Ribs were good, nice and smokey. Out of all the sides we got, I enjoyed the beans and fries the most. I'm not usually a beans type of person, but the Smoque version was bursting with flavor. The fries were hot and fresh and tasted great dipped in BBQ sauce. Cornbread was decent although I couldn't tell you what constitutes good cornbread (I might have been too full to appreciate it). The biggest disappointment was the mac & cheese. The \"large\" we got was simply two of their pre-portioned containers, which are pretty small. Honestly it tasted pretty bland and the texture was not creamy or cheesy whatsoever.

However, I can absolutely say that Smoque was better barbecue than any I've had in Chicago. <br><br>Ultimately, barbecue is a combination of artistry and effort. Many barbecue shops end up lacking in one or the other. Smoque on the other hand is absolutely willing to put their artisan's love into their food.

The brisket itself was absolutely fantastic though. <br><br>The way Smoque distinguishes itself can be felt through their brisket. While most brisket is either 1.) bland or 2.) drowned in sauce to replace flavor, Smoque manages to cultivate flavor organically through their cooking process.

The only thing that comes off on your fingers is a little bit of dry rub and the occasional sauce you wound up getting your fingers into by accident. The brisket was so tender and moist I was actually quite happy eating it without any sauce at all. However, I can recommend all of their sauces.

It was 8pm, we found parking right in front (the street across is residential only though), the place was busy but boo and I were next in line, so very little wait...great start. They were closing in an hour at 9, so the fact that the place was still so lively was very impressive. Other reviews make it out to seem that the place is tiny with virtually no seating, but they actually do have a decent amount, especially with the outdoor tables. However, since this place is always at capacity, I can see the criticism.<br><br>Service was exceptional. Especially as newbies, we felt very comfortable. Even during our short wait in line, we were assured that a table would be waiting for us after placing our order. During our meal, we were asked if we needed anything. Staff ended up getting a to-go box for us, even though we were right next to them. They even suggested and gave us a separate bag for the sauces and sides in case of spillage. Also, we did not have to wait long at all for our food to be ready.<br><br>Between us, we got the full slab of baby back ribs platter (slaw with brisket chili, fries), sliced brisket platter (slaw with cornbread, baked beans), tasting of sausage, and the bread pudding. Some of the reviews say the sides are not good here. I disagree. The baked beans were I think the best I've had. They were very smoky which I enjoyed. Fries were perfect. The brisket chili was tasty. Their slaw was also top notch! Instead of the usual creamy slaws, this was bright and refreshing and made for perfect breaks between all the other heavier fare. The only thing that was a bit subpar was the cornbread. The sausage was perfect. The ribs were yummy, somewhat falling off the bone, but not too much. The brisket was also very solid and paired perfectly with the Carolina vinegar sauce. My boo loved their Memphis - all around sauce. I'm not a sweet tooth, but that bread pudding was amazing. <br><br>You know a BBQ place is good when there aren't additional sauces at the table and that the food is enjoyed simply with what they give you. There are many BBQ places in the city that are certainly tasty but not authentic bbq, in that their lack of smoky meats is compensated with other components - sauce and other flavorings. Here at Smoque, the meat speaks for itself and their simple perfected sauce and seasonings only elevate it. It's also a good sign that their menu is on the limited side.<br><br>Smoque definitely has the charm of what BBQ should be and is definitely the best in the city, while I'm sure TX and other popular places have it beat. I'm dying to come back and try their peach cobbler and consume more delicious BBQ. Prices were also much cheaper than other BBQ places I've been to while the portions were appropriate. For all that we got for under $50 after tax and their amazing service, Smoque deserves all the hype. *Definitely choose wisely on when to come though.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IAsc6ltC2qj4nCr9cHD3PA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Full slab baby back, fries, brisket chili, sausage tasting"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VOOg9EcGxiBj1uQE2cZoUg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Sliced brisket, cornbread, baked beans, toffee pecan bread pudding"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Meat falls right off the bone.

When we arrived most of the tables were taken and there were about 15 people in line in front of us. We gave our name to the host and hoped a table would be available when our food was ready but we knew this place had to be good given how packed it was. The menu had plenty of options from brisket, pork, ribs, many sides, etc. Pretty typical for a BBQ joint. Just staring at the menu made my mouth water...<br><br>After about a 10 minute wait we made it to the counter. We decided to order a few things and split them as the menu didn't feature a multiple meat platter. I ordered a half rack of baby back ribs with fries and my friend ordered the brisket sandwich with mac & cheese and coleslaw. Within minutes of ordering I got tapped on the shoulder and the host had our table ready. Perfect! Like a well oiled machine. <br><br>Within 10 minutes or so our meal was ready and it didn't disappoint. The half rack of ribs had 6 ribs that fell clean off the bone, the mark of a perfect rib. The sauce that came with the ribs was a good compliment for meal and I couldn't stop dipping my fries in. And the fries themselves were some of the best fries I've ever had. Delicious potatoey goodness! The brisket sandwich was great too! The meat was smoky and tender and had a perfect char to it on the outside. If I had no self restraint I could have eaten ribs and a brisket sandwich. And finally, the mac & cheese was the perfect way to top this meal. I'm a sucker for cheese and carbs so...<br><br>Overall, Smoque is a bit out of the way but definitely worth the trip.

The individuals that seat you and clear tables are on point, even when the place is FULL UP, they always manage to move tables around and keep it flowing to the point that as soon as you get your food, you've been sitting for at least a few minutes. Can't beat the fact that it is also a BYOB. Also, in the summer, the outdoor seating is a great option to have. Typically when we go here we order the gumbo.. which is a gorgeous little piece of heaven. They have the white rice on the bottom and it's not overly fatty and just very well done with a little bit of spice that hits just right. Also, we tend to get the St. Louis Ribs... so meaty, so well done, the rub is so delicious I sometimes don't even need some sauce (Carolina is my preferred). We also grab some brisket (if you order it chopped, you won't be sorry). Additionally, their mac and cheese is just simply divine.

Overall, Green Street has better sides and a better non-food experience; Smoque has better meat and better price points. But both are *amazing* and you cannot go wrong with either.<br><br>ATMOSPHERE/SERVICE: Whereas Green Street presents itself as the trendier location-- barn/warehouse decor, West Loop locale, etc., Smoque is more of a neighborhood joint. It's in a more residential area, with plenty of parking on side streets (there's even a small parking lot, suburban style!). The interior is pretty bare-bones, like countless BBQ joints in the South. It's more authentic, but, at the same time, I'm a bit of a sucker for the warehouse vibe, and it's a little more unique. Both places can have long lines for food, but Smoque has more limited seating and kind of botched our order at first. Edge: Green Street.<br><br>SIDES: Green Street's beans are the best. Smoque's are smokier, but less complex and tangy, and maybe a little watery. Still good. Smoque's cornbread is tasty but small. Their coleslaw is vinegary (a plus) and full of raw onion (which I found to be not great). Their mac n cheese is tasty, but I'm not a mac n cheese guy with BBQ. Green Street's sides are more varied and bigger. But neither place has collards! WHERE ARE THE COLLARD GREENS, GUYS?! Edge: Green Street.<br><br>MEAT: I have really only had sliced brisket at both places. Green Street's, while very tasty, is not as good as Smoque's. Why? The fat. Smoque's brisket (at least the slices I got) was laced with amazing, melt-in-your-mouth smoked fat. If I could, I'd order their fat trimmings and spread it on a cracker or eat it with a spoon. Don't go to Smoque if you think that saturated fat is really bad for you.<br><br>$$: Smoque is cheaper. Also, it's BYOB (but only indoors).<br><br>I'd say: go to Green Street if you're not so much into BBQ as you are into the sides and/or your main purpose is for the social aspect of eating out. Go to Smoque if you are serious about your smoked meat product.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Extremely excellent food. The smoked sausage, and the beef brisket was absolutely amazing.

I wish Smoque offered more food combination meals, while also offering additional flavors of sauce. On the other hand, I was able to put my own variety together and still walk away paying a reasonable price.<br><br>For my late lunch and early dinner, I got the sliced brisket sandwich with mac n cheese and coleslaw. I also had a craving for ribs, so I got the St. Louis half rack. Thinking these portions wouldn't fill me up, I was only able to finish the sandwich and mac. With your sandwich, you get to sample both of their sauces, a Carolina sauce, and the Memphis. For both the sandwich and ribs, I used the Memphis. I found that the vinegar-based Carolina concoction was a little too overpowering for both meats.  <br><br>I have yet to visit a restaurant that serves a decent mac n cheese. The noodles are always too soft and too girthy for my taste. Smoque rates the same, and like other restaurants, nails the crusty top and an actual perfect pairing of cheeses, boosting that cheesy punch we all look for in this classic American pasta dish. I ended up scooping most of it on top of the brisket, so my sandwich had cheese. It must be a faux pas to ask for cheese on top of your barbecued meat. I certainly did not see it as an option to add cheese to your sandwich on the menu. It really made the sandwich. <br><br>I had the St. Louis half rack for breakfast. It reheated nicely (under a low heat) in my toaster oven. I was surprised that the ends of the ribs were dry, and the center of the rib meat was where you got the best moist and fatty bites of meat. I don't think that my toaster oven is responsible for that. On my next visit, I am going for the leaner baby-back ribs.

The baby back ribs were a little on the dry side because it had more meat on the bone but you can just dip the pork in the Memphis style sauce that they provide. For sides, I got an order of the mac n cheese and cornbread. Both came in small portions but I thought it was just the right amount of food. The mac n cheese was average in my opinion.

I tend to find brisket too dry but this place was tender, juicy, with just enough fat to balance the meat. <br>- Corn bread was good when warm, but was a little dry once it cooled down.<br>- Fries were piping hot, fresh, and perfectly crisp on the outside. So good, we ended up buying seconds! Large, that is!<br>- Coleslaw has just enough vinegar to balance all the meat. <br>- Mac n cheese was worth getting another, creamy and oh, so cheesy.<br>- Brisket chili, I could've done without...

I opted for the chopped brisket plate with a choice of 2 sides and slaw for ~$14. The portion of meat was substantial and I had plenty to take home. The meat is definitely the center piece at Smoque, with all meats served with two sauces on the side.  Meats are paired with specific sauces that complement the cuts and flavorings of the dish and I enjoyed the contrast of the two sauces that came with my meal - one was a thick and creamy mesquite sauce and the other was a brisket-specific, vinegar based sauce. Both were tasty! I hoped the brisket would compete with the likes of some of the Austin BBQ I've tried, but it didn't quite get there. A pretty solid Chicago alternative, but I've still gotta make the trek to ATX the best of brisket country.<br><br>Lots of sides to choose from but I went with the mac & cheese and the fries. The mac & cheese was decadent, with just the right amount of cheese flavor.  The small portion left me wanting more, and I later saw other customers choose mac & cheese for both of their sides to make up for it (what a great idea!).  The fries were served hot and fresh in a small brown paper bag and were plenty to share with a friend.  Portion-wise, the fries were the better deal. <br><br>The place is BYOB (except for the patio, which is a bummer) & totally surprised me!

I'd get brisket again. The only off point was the ribs...they had a wonderful bark on them and the same smokey flavor but the meat was a bit dry and tough. They were baby-back though so maybe that was to be expected...but my vote goes for the brisket anyway. The platters come with slaw and two sides...we tried cornbread (straight up with no herbs and 4 stars), fries (with the skin on and 4 stars), coleslaw (vinegary and 4 stars), mac and cheese (creamy and just like Kraft does it and 5 stars), and BBQ beans (with small pieces of BBQ meat in it and 5 stars), and one of us tried the pecan bread pudding (perfect foil for the BBQ flavors and 5 stars). The meals come with two 5 star BBQ sauces...Memphis (has a tang to it) and Carolina (thinner and vinegary).<br><br>Service...they know how to run a place. This place rests on its food and not its ambiance, it is simply a store front operation with a bunch of wooden tables and chairs...the walls are painted and there aren't any drapes or mood lighting (just good BBQ). Get in line when you arrive and work your way up to the counter (no taking a seat until you have some food). The check in check out is easy. Pay for your order at the cashier (the kitchen streams off behind her) and one of the staff directs you to a seat...this way people not eating don't hog the seats to early...this is well thought out. Service was always in the background...they don't hurry you at all, but when your done the table is cleaned in a second. They have enough staff to take care of the room size...probably more staff than they need. Friendly and efficient. They also have a big carryout clientele...you have a stream of people just picking up...so don't be afraid of the line...it is worth it also. <br><br>So the only thing that kept this to 4 stars is that I can't give 4 1/2...they missed 5 stars with the little bit dry baby backs...although the taste was there. Give this place a try. It had the best brisket I have ever had. The four of us ate for $60...nice reasonable deal. Parking outside is problematic since you are in a city neighborhood (South Old Irving Park) but work with it and you'll be glad you did.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "We went to Smoque on a Saturday night for dinner with KT and BS.  The place was very busy is not really set up to handle their fame.  Their system works well in that a host gets your order number and when a table comes available he seats you and puts your order in.  This works, but in the meantime you really have no place to wait.  You end up standing in awkward places between tables and in what aisles there are.  We did have a fairly long wait, although it may have just seemed that way.  I think I would try another night of the week, but who knows, it may be the same.<br><br>To sample, I ordered a chopped brisket sandwich and for Ms T I ordered pulled pork.  I also got a half slab of back ribs and some slaw.  KT and BS had a rack of ribs with mac and cheese and slaw.<br><br>The ribs were probably 3-1/2 stars.  Pretty good flavor and a nice rub.  They were not intensely smoky although they are very dark.  This is how dark my ribs at home looked when I did not realize how hot my smoker was running.  I have since fixed that problem.  I suspect they are smoking all of their meat too hot because it is all really black but not exceptionally smoky.  The ribs on this occasion also were a little overdone.  You can see a lot of white bone in the photos that you should not see.  I'm sure there is day to day and rack to rack variability but this kept my appraisal short of four stars or better.  Certainly they are worth trying again.<br><br>I ordered chopped brisket in self-defense.  Lately when ordering brisket outside of Texas, it has been underdone and you can't eat it on a sandwich without pulling it all off with the first bite.  So chopped was my choice to pre-empt this experience.  I appreciate that they offer this choice.  I suspect they provide the chopped option as a way to use the ends and pieces that don't make nice slices.  That is not a bad thing, you get a lot of outside meat and consequently a lot of smoke and bark flavor.  This was a good sandwich, much larger than I wanted.  Because the bun is too large and bready, I just ate unsauced meat off the bun. <br><br>Ms T had pulled pork on her sandwich.  She prefers to eat her barbecue with sauce.  Simply put, you do not want to eat Smoque's sauce.  Neither the spicy nor the mild were worth bothering with.  So she did not enjoy eating the pork.  She felt it was not very smoky and without sauce, well..... live by the sauce, die by the sauce.  <br><br>KT and BS were given a free sample of both sliced and chopped brisket because the nice guy preparing their order thought they should have some with their rack.  He unfortunately put sauce on the sliced portion, so it was hard for me to really evaluate the sliced brisket for flavor.  It was moist, good bark, not as smoky as it looks.  I would say above average for the Midwest.  Just don't let them sauce anything for you, but that is my policy anyway, regardless of the place and the sauce.<br><br>The sausage was OK.  It was almost more like a Polish sausage than what I associate with barbecue.  It had more garlic, was denser in texture and was not smoked a lot.  I can't help but compare it to what I have had in Texas.<br><br>Sides were indifferent.  We did not touch the slaw due to the significant dose of red onion.  We would not have ordered it if we had known.  I am the only one who liked the baked, thick style mac and cheese.  I prefer this to the Kraft Velveeta kind.  This was made with actual cheese, so consequently it was a little grainy.  That happens.  I also liked the corn bread.  It was pretty sweet with some sweet corn kernals.<br><br>All in all I am having a difficult time rating Smoque.  It is definitely a \"thing\" and overrated by barbecue starved Chicagoans, but that does not make it bad.  Ms T would not return while I would, but hopefully on a night with no significant wait.  I would try ribs again and see if over cooking is systematic.  I would order chopped brisket as a platter.  I don't know what sides I would get.  It breaks my heart to not be able to get onion free slaw.  OK, I made up my mind, the slaw tipped the balance to three stars.  I really would go 3-1/2 if I could.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GUJ5GuZmk6-dIeyY9OqiOw/348s.jpg", "caption": "Full Rack of ribs, quite overdone.

It's impossible not to like Smoque unless you lack tastebuds. However, I do not LOVE Smoque like so many others do. Yes, it's better than most BBQ places around here.

However, Chicago isn't necessarily a BBQ Mecca (see KC, Memphis, Carolina, Alabama, Austin) and a lot of other places in the city are nearly as good as Smoque. <br><br>That being said, there is tons to like about Smoque. Every single side dish is amazing - possibly the greatest BBQ sides in Chicago outside of Lillie's Q. Succulent mac 'n cheese, brisket chili is original and delicious, great beans, and a hell of a cornbread. The meat is the star of the show; especially the ribs. Great brisket (both chopped and sliced), amazing links, and an even better rib selection (baby back & St. Louis). Haven't tried pulled pork. Both sauces (Carolina & Memphis) are delightful. Price is decent - what you would expect. BYOB makes it amazing. Location is central for all of Chicago and easy to get to and find parking.<br><br>The only qualms I have with Smoque are associated with a fairly weak ambience. First off, it's a pain in the ass to find seating and get the order. Often times they are so crowded that I cannot hear my number and the food sits. The sauce serving size is meager and they should (like most other Chicago BBQ joints) absolutely put bottles of sauce on all tables! No reason this place should go cheapskate on the sauce given the juggernaut they are in Chicago. Serving size could be larger on the non-rib end, as well. <br><br>Obviously I'll be back to Smoque.

At that point they start preparing your order. <br><br>About 15 minutes after we got our table, our food was ready. Everything was SO GOOD and you get SO MUCH food. Between the 3 of us we had:<br><br>1/2 and 1/2 sandwich order-- 1/2 pulled pork, 1/2 chopped brisket. I wanted to try both and this was the best way to do it. If you think ordering half portions means you'll get less food, you'd be wrong. <br>Sliced brisket--such good flavor: smoky and tender. Probably liked this version better than the chopped brisket in my sandwich. <br>Half chicken--This might as well feed 2 people because it was so large<br>1/4 slab of St Louis Ribs--you can get this as an add on so of course we did. Again, amazing flavor, so tender. <br><br>All of our sides came as part of the meals. <br>Mac and cheese--It looks like a small portion, but it's so rich you'll be glad to not have more because it's tasty so then you'd eat more and be even more full. <br>Fries--you get a brown paper bag full of them. Is this the \"small\" version when it comes with the meal? I don't know, but you get way more fries than I expected. <br>Cornbread--Pretty standard, but good<br>Coleslaw--More on the vinegary side than mayo, which I appreciated because it's my preference.<br><br>Oh and the sauces. I was a big fan of the thicker Memphis Style sauce, but the Carolina style was good if that's your thing. <br><br>We pretty much finished everything because we're gluttons and because it was so good it would have been a waste not to. And then they had to roll us out of there. But seriously, I was full until lunch the next day. Next time, I would probably not eat the rolls that come with the sandwiches. They are good enough, but they take up valuable space in your stomach. <br><br>Overall, pricing was quite fair, especially when you consider the portions. All of our food plus 2 fountain drinks (and free cup of water) came out to just under $60. We used an a la card so our total bill was even cheaper at $49. We easily found free street parking.

It is REALLY hard for me to decide which one I prefer: St Louis or Baby back ribs. The baby back ribs are smaller and more curved. They are a bit sweeter. But the St Louis are more straight on the bone and have a little bit more meat. Not as sweet. I would recommend you get some with a friend and split the two. <br><br>// Added Sliced Brisket - $5 - This brisket was pretty good but it was a little bit dry.

On a late Friday night around 9, we walked in to a busy, homey joint eager for barbecue. We scanned the menu and walked straight to the counter to order. I got 1/4 rack of St. Louis ribs with cole slaw and Mac n cheese (felt like the perfect portion to me) and she got a 1/3 rack of Baby Back ribs with fries and Mac n cheese (hers came with cole slaw). <br><br>As we settled down to the picnic like tables, we realized the cramped venue was BYOB. People brought in their own beer and even hard liquor and everyone looked very cheery and comfortable! Our food came shortly after and we of course had to take a first bite of the Mac n cheese - holy cheese gods! The flavors and creaminess of this BBQ side staple were absolutely heavenly and though the silver tin it came in was tiny, I was so excited to gobble down the whole thing. But, I have this thing where I like to save the best for last so I moved on to try the cole slaw. The cole slaw was a downer, not a lot of wetness and too peppery for me. Alas! But the crunchiness of the cabbage was a good complement to everything else. My friend's fries came in a huge portion. They were seasoned well, but felt too heavy for a bbq side in my opinion.<br><br>Next, the ribs! Man oh man, it's been so long since I've had ribs and they were phenomenal. I cleaned each rib to the bone. Each rib was so meaty and flavorful and the 1/4 rack was perfect! My friends 1/2 baby rack ribs were much smaller (not sure the appeal of baby back over St. Louis?). The ribs came with a small cup of the St. Louis sauce and I wasn't a fan of this sauce actually. It was more tangy than I would prefer. If I were to compare Q BBQ with Smoque, Q would definitely win the sauce category with their variety and unlimited quantities. Since I had brisket at Q, I can't compare the meats, but both had me blown away! <br><br>After some time, I was ready to finish up my macaroni. I was devastated to find that it got cold and the creaminess kind of curdled.

First off....texture of the pulled pork was actually pretty amazing. Maybe I was lucky, but I got a bite with great crust, moist meat, and the perfect amount of savory fat to balance it all together. They drizzle a bit of their Memphis sauce on top of it but the pork stood on its own. The brisket also had a great smokey flavor, but I think from what I tried anyways their greater ratio of fat/lean meat in the pulled pork put it over texturally. Had a bit of trouble choosing which sides to grab, as with the coleslaw you get your choice of two between Baked beans, fries, mac n'cheese, and brisket chili. The Mac n' cheese was probably my favorite side; the fries were fries(still hot out of the fryer so you can't go wrong with them), and the brisket chili was alright but overall less flavorful than I thought it would be. <br><br>The Cole slaw too was actually really good, and if I didn't get it with the platter I would have ordered it on the side; It wasn't mayo-based but vinegar based so it tasted a little lighter than some other slaws, and added some freshness that provided a good balance with the smokey meats. As far as their sauces go, they provide two, a vinegar based Carolina sauce and a thicker Memphis Sauce. The sauces are good...but in all honestly didn't seem to distinguish themselves all too much from other bbq sauces I've had. <br><br>Verdict: Good but not mindblowing bbq, and given that it takes an hour for me to get there, not sure how often I would make the trip.

The fatty bit at the top is incredible and melts in your mouth like butter. The pulled pork was nice and also very juicy with a great smoky flavor. It was more chopped than pulled, but was still great. I disliked the St Louis ribs because they were too dry (I know they're dry by nature but they were not great and too spicy without there being enough good meaty flavor to interact with the spice). <br><br>The cornbread was unimpressive and also very dry; the Mac n cheese was watery and not super cheesy; the bbq beans were also very watery and sour/ vinegary.

We ordered a full slab of ribs (22.95) and since we were indecisive about which type we wanted, baby back or St. Louis. Both were delicious, but I prefer the baby back ribs since the St. Louis is fattier. None fall off the bone since they are smoked. For our two sides, we chose the Mac and cheese, which I would recommend, and the chili, which I would not. It was a little too watery. We also ordered a platter of pulled pork a la carte (8.45).

Beware, a \"large\" mac-n-cheese is 2 very small little containers. The sweet tea is pre-made syrup; they can't even brew sweet tea.

Smoque's mac n'cheese is a vast improvement over most BBQ places that give you noodles mixed with a yellow substance and it really just tastes like you're eating glue.<br><br>The baked beans: They were a little too watery for my liking, but the flavor was a perfect mix of sweet and smoky with  a little tang. Well done.<br><br>The cole slaw: Not a fan at all. It seems much more like an after thought than anything. It was quite bland with the exception of a vinegar taste. It honestly looked as if they cut up some cabbage, put pepper and vinegar on it, and put it in a container. Definitely could be improved.<br><br>The BBQ sauce: I really enjoyed the Memphis style sauce, though it may have been just a tad spicier than I like my BBQ sauce to be (I much prefer a sweet sauce, and Memphis is typically on the sweeter side, so I was surprised that it wasn't as sweet). However, I wasn't a fan of the Carolina BBQ sauce at all. I like that they were clearly labeled, and even gave some direction for which sauce to put on which meats.

Either way, I'm so happy I know where I am getting ribs from now on. The sides were just ok for us, tho I did really like those BBQ beans, and my 2 bites of the cobbler.

This is the best BBQ I've ever had. The brisket was tender, nicely placed on a fresh bun - and a fairly good amount of meat too. The sauce wasn't too hot or too sweet - it was right there - the perfect accommodation for beef that was so thoughtfully cooked. Fries were good and the cole slaw was delicious as well - sometimes vinegar cole slaws are a little harsh - this was just fine.<br><br>This place really needs a little more room and a better place for people to wait in  line. Seating was fine - the staff has it together that way, but it was a little aggravating to have all these people stand around me, along with an occasional touch of cold air coming from the exit door about 10 feet away.

They don't look that pretty but their rub has really good flavor. I don't know that I detected a really good smoke flavor but they tasted great and were tender and the meat easily released from the bone. Delicious, I think the best ribs I've had in Chicago of the 4 or so BBQ joints I've tried. My bf also got a side of their Texas sausage. I had a bite, garlic-y and delicious. I would happily eat their sausage as a meal. I don't know how authentic it was compared to Texas sausage, I suspect not much, but still very good.<br><br>Their staff is also extremely friendly. My bf and I were standing in front of the pick up counter and the cook asked us if we were the order # he was working on, we were indeed. He was surprised we did not order any brisket, he said he would give us some for free to try, which ended up being an entire tray of both their chopped and sliced brisket with sauce, completely free. That's what I call service. The brisket was really good, tender and flavorful. <br><br>Regulars obviously know how the ordering process works here. For the newbies, here's the deal: You line up to order for dine in, staff ask you how many are in your party and say they will seat you once they are ready with a table. After you order this same staff member will ask you for your order # so he knows what food goes with who. They do not fire your food until their is a table ready for you. It's a small, cramped place but despite it being packed with not a ton of space, the staff is on top of everything and extremely nice. When there are tables clearing out and being cleaned up, they tell the cooks what order #s to fire so you have a table when your food is ready. That does mean that many people who have already ordered and are waiting in a cramped place will have their food on hold until there is a table ready for them. This could make for very long wait times. We got there \"just in time\" on a Saturday night and still had to wait. I wouldn't be surprised if the others waiting while we were eating waited for an hour or more. The place was hoppin. <br><br>Where they fall short? Their sides and sauces. I didn't like either their regular or spicy sauce very much, and in fact really actually disliked their regular sauce. Their spicy was better on the ribs and the Texas sausage, but not on its own. I would have liked it a bit more sweet. Because of their sauce I would never order their brisket. It was good and tender like I said, but its just sauced meat either on a tray or on a bun. If their sauce was better, I'd be more into it. Their cornbread and mac n cheese, the 2 sides I got with our full slab, are after thoughts. The cornbread is a bit dry and could be more flavorful. The mac n cheese is typical mealy, powdery type mac n cheese that you get at basically every restaurant in America because no one knows how to make creamy mac n cheese apparently. It was better with some salt but nothing to talk about. Their fries are the same kinda soggy fries you can get at any hot dog or italian beef joint in Chicago. DESPITE their sides and sauces not being stellar, their ribs were so good that I can overlook the sides and sauces. I understand why people line up for this place and would definitely come back.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aBJtLV6ztIxEyzHKKxoaYw/348s.jpg", "caption": "FREE tray of sliced and chopped brisket.

I've had BBQ in all kinds of places, and nothing comes close. This is the real friggin' deal.

I only needed my fork to cut it, but honestly, it was so tender a stiff breeze probably would have done the job. It's served with a thinner, somewhat tart sauce that balances the rich smokiness of the beef (no need to drown it in sauce, a little dab will do the job).<br><br>- Pulled pork: as my wife put it, this was the most \"pulled\" pulled pork she ever had, as it fell into beautiful shreds when met by a fork. The pork also had a lovely bark and was perfectly moist.<br><br>- Ribs: Seriously. These ribs. I'm a rib fiend and these were the best I've ever had.

The ribs are covered in a crackling bark and come with a thicker, sweeter sauce (again, no need to go overboard on the dipping, the meat speaks for itself).<br><br>- Sausage: Excellent smoked beef sausage. Not much more to say here -- if you dig Texas-style smoked sausage, you won't be disappointed.<br><br>THE SIDES:<br><br>- Slaw: I typically avoid slaw at BBQ joints because the gloppy, mayo-blasted stuff you usually get is foul. At Smoque, the slaw is fresh and acidic with nary a drop of mayo in sight. It's made with a simple mix of cabbage and red onions and was a nice counterpoint to the BBQ.<br><br>- Beans: Not your typical baked beans. There's no sugary-sweet thick glaze on these guys, which is a good thing in my opinion. They had a thinner, more vinegary sauce that was studded with little bits of brisket.<br><br>- Mac and cheese: Cheesy, crusty -- nice and straightforward. They didn't try to get cute with anything here, just cheese sauce and noodles, nothing else needed.<br><br>- Fries: Crispy, hot and salty. What else could you want?<br><br>- Cornbread: Excellent cornbread. It's not some crap made from a box mix. It was warm, fluffy and buttery, and had whole kernels of corn in it (which I love). <br><br>THE SERVICE:<br>The staff at Smoque was great. They have a team of hosts/runners/waiters that get you a table, bring you your food and clear trays away. They were all friendly and helpful. You pay at the counter then take your seat, but make sure to throw a few bucks in the tip jar for the team -- they earn it. <br><br>We actually got a bonus rib portion because when I went to pick up our sample tray, the gal behind the counter said the piece was too small (it wasn't, but who am I to argue with free ribs?).<br><br>All in all, this is one of the top 5 meals I've had in Chicago. Like I said at the top, best BBQ I've ever eaten. I will definitely be back.

We ordered the baby back ribs and the meat was so tender. It had a good meat to fat ratio. Plus, the meat had a wonderful crust that was not charred up with burnt meat.  It was smoked really well and you can taste it in the food. We were so impressed!!!<br><br>If you order the food as a combo, it comes with two sides.  The order comes with a side of coleslaw already so make sure you pick two different sides.  We had the baked beans, french fries, mac and cheese, peach cobbler and the corn bread.  My favorite was the coleslaw.  It was made with a vinaigrette dressing and was super delicious!  My other two favorite sides were the french fries and the peach cobbler.  The mac and cheese was good too but too creamy for me.  I was surprised that this BBQ place did not have mashed potatoes. Maybe a suggestion for the future? I love me some mashed potatoes!<br><br>There are rules outside of the restaurant, such as you cannot pick where you want to sit.  I guess seating is tight at the restaurant so they need to pack everyone in. We had a table sitting right next to us, even though there were other open seats available.  It did start getting busy later in the evening so I can see why they want everyone seated in an orderly fashion.<br><br>Service here was really top notch.  Everyone was really nice and friendly.  Its a pay first, eat later type of restaurant so I wasn't even expecting to be served. What a pleasant surprise!<br><br>Street parking is available in the area.  However, there are signs across the street from the restaurant that say you aren't allowed to park. I think its because the residents that live across the street from the restaurant don't want anyone taking up their parking spots.

We were craving some meat especially some really good brisket. Smoque was on the show Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives about 7 years ago and has built a reputation for good BBQ around the Chicago area. And it so happened to be that when we were there, the Food Network was filming at Smoque again! They wouldn't tell us what show it was for though, but it was cool to see the Food Network there.<br><br>When we got to Smoque, it smelled really good. You could smell the meat and the smoke and it made us hungrier. We decided to go family style and share everything. We got the sliced beef brisket platter with Mac & Cheese and BBQ Beans, the Rib Combo (Half Baby Back/Half St. Louis) with Brisket Chili and Cornbread, we added a Texas Sausage, and for dessert we got both the Peach Cobbler and Bread Pudding. Coleslaw was included in every platter.<br><br>The food took about 10 min to be served, but it felt like 30 cause we so hungry. I had to stop myself from digging right in to take a quick picture of the food.<br><br>After we all took our pictures, we went straight in for that brisket and one word came to all of our minds...mushy. The brisket was terrible. It was not brisket and it was definitely not BBQ. It was boiled meat that has been boiled for too long and served with a less than average BBQ sauce. There was no smoke ring, no smoke flavor, or any flavor at all. Yeah I know it's supposed to be fork tender or melt in your mouth tender, but there is a BIG line between melt in your mouth tender to having the whole piece disintegrate into nothing before it even touches your mouth. The sauce tasted like generic BBQ sauce that they poured in vinegar and mustard. It was nothing interesting or spectacular. The brisket chili was horrible. It was watery, no flavor, not enough salt, the beans were too mushy, and the brisket was non-existent in it. The cornbread was not good. It was not sweet, it was not savory, and it had no corn flavor. And the coleslaw tasted like pure apple cider vinegar and that's it. The vinegar was so harsh that any flavor or spice they put into that coleslaw was just obliterated by the vinegar.<br><br>Then we moved to the Rib Combo. This combo was good except for the coleslaw and the baby back ribs. The baby back ribs were okay. They weren't the best ribs I have ever made nor were they the worst. There could have been more seasoning on it, more smoke, and it was overcooked. People think that ribs are the best when it falls off the bone, but to me that's wrong. The meat should be tender but when you take a bite out of the rib, the rest of the meat should still stick on the bone. That's exactly what the St. Louis ribs did. This was the highlight of the entire meal. These ribs were really good. It was nicely seasoned, you could taste the smoke, and it was perfectly cooked. This platter also had the 2 best sides as well. The BBQ beans were good, but it was just a little too sweet. It could have used more vinegar and mustard to cut down that sweetness. The Mac & Cheese was good as well. It was creamy, cheesy, and rich, just like how every Mac & Cheese should be. The panko topping on top added the crunch the Mac & Cheese needed<br><br>The Texas sausage was also really good. It was nicely seasoned and had that great snap to it. This is a must get as well.<br><br>However, the dessert was a huge failure. They were stone cold and did not have that wow factor that desserts have. The peach cobbler was just completely one note. The crunch on top was soggy, the peaches in syrup should have been bubbling so create that warmness in peach cobbler, and there was no pastry base to it. It was more of a crumble then a cobbler. The bread pudding was so dense, heavy, and dry. It needed more of that pecan caramel topping on it. The topping was actually pretty good. It added that necessary crunch to the bread pudding.<br><br>For almost $20 per person, Smoque was not worth it. It was way over hyped for what it was worth. Maybe they were having an off day or maybe Guy just got it completely wrong, but this was definitely not a place where I had to check out in Chicago. Overall this whole meal could be summed up in one word.

With a humble sense of objectivity, Smoque just might be the best bbq in America. This past year I've had \"the best\" in KC, Graceland & Texas - all notorious for excellent bbq. The quality and consistency of Smoque is surprising. Last week after being directed to the best bbq in San Antonio -and confirming its 4.5 star rating on Yelp- I was ashamed to say Smoque does Texas bbq better than Texas, way better. The meats and sauces are amazing, but the selling point for me is the sides. Best beans I've ever had. Great fries. Hearty slaw, etc. And to top it off, Smoque is by far the best in presentation. Bbq places tend to have a hole-in-a-wall appeal and presentation (which I love).

You have GOT to go!!<br><br>Let me give you a few logistics before I talk about the crazy good food. First, you need to BYOB, so go by Trader Joe's or Binny's or Whole Foods and buy beer. Get a good micro-brew because this place deserves it. <br><br>Second, go EARLY! They sell out. Having been there many, many times, I can tell you that they sell out often of the good stuff. <br><br>Third, don't let the line scare you. They move that line pretty quick. Yes, the darn line goes out the door and down the block sometimes, and, while I hate waiting, I always beg my hubby to let us stand in this line. Even in the winter, and if you knew how much I hate, hate, hate the Chi-town winters, you would understand what a sacrifice that is for me. <br><br>The place will usually be PACKED when you finally get in the door. But, don't worry. They will find a table for you by the time your order is ready. Just go ahead and place your order, stand where they tell you to and the owner will tell you when and where to sit. Just do it. It's a privilege to be in there.<br><br>Now, the food. I'll start with a disclaimer, as a native South Floridian, I didn't really know good BBQ from bad. I mean, we're known for not knowing how to vote, and not for our BBQ. But I married a Texan. (Yeah, girls, be jealous, they know how to grow them in Texas.) And, my Texan knows BBQ. So, an endorsement from him is a big deal. He LOVES this place.<br><br>They make this beef brisket by smoking long and low. It gets this lovely smoke ring all around, and the flavor is to die for. Then they get their sausages from Mikeska's. Texans will know what that means because Mikeska's is a Texas institution. They know their sausage. And, Smoque gets it from them. (The sausage is a big sellout early in the evening, so try before 7 pm for that).<br><br>And, the cornbread! Oh, man! Sweet but not like cake. Moist. With little pieces of real corn. Love it.<br><br>Then, they make their baked beans in house. With their own recipe. And they put chopped beef brisket in the baked beans! Oh, my stomach growls and my mouth waters just writing about it. Chi-town, how I will miss those beans!<br><br>The hubby likes the mac and cheese. He's a big mac and cheese eater and he likes the one made here.<br><br>Lastly, one of the owners is usually in the kitchen, while the other one helps keep the line flowing smoothly and the seating arranged. <br><br>Just go!

One note on the macaroni--you can get a small (one aluminum tin) or large (two aluminum tins, aka the large is twice the size as the small). The small is what comes with the entrees. So, if you're getting one of the sandwiches, it's actually more advantageous to order the sandwich a la carte and then a large macaroni on the side.

One wall held a huge chalk board with the menu. I didn't have to look far before deciding on a 1/2 slab of baby back ribs with 2 sides for about $14. I originally chose mac and cheese and coleslaw as my sides, but happily found out that the meal already came with slaw and so I ecstatically selected cornbread. Tears almost came to my eyes as I realized they served Coke. After being at multiple places in the city, I was beginning to think the entire state of Illinois only served Pepsi. But there is was, a self-serve fountain soda machine with Coke clearly written on the side. <br><br>Some guy told us to order our food first and he would put together a table for our party of 5. The entire place probably only seated about 25 or 30 people. We were seated by the window, right next to the counter where the food came out. We probably waited about 10 minutes, maybe less before our orders were called. You help yourself to plastic utensils and there are plenty of napkin dispensers on the tables. Important detail: the napkins came out from the top so they were easy to pull with your bbq-laden hands. Very important to have easy access to napkins.<br><br>Anyway, the ribs were flavorful, juicy and fell off the bone. They give you extra sauce and it was probably the best BBQ sauce I've ever had. I wanted to stick a straw into it and drink it. The cornbread was so warm, the crust was perfect and the bread was moist. It and the mac and cheese, so cheesy, so yummy, both came in these little aluminum containers that were the perfect size. Anymore and it would've been overkill. The slaw was vinegar-based, not mayo-based, so it was interesting and different, but in a great way. For 5 people, it was only about $70.<br><br>Others at the table got brisket (thumbs up) and someone got the fries, which came in a mini brown bag that soon became grease-soaked. They were regular-sized fries, just simple tossed in like salt and pepper, but still had the skin on. And they were fried to perfection. As we finished one by one, some guy came by and took away some of our trays for us.<br><br>As we stood up to leave, my colleague who ordered the fries put it on his tray. I panicked. <br><br>Me: \"Are you going to throw those away??!\" <br>Him: \"Well, yeah.\" <br>Me: \"Are you crazy? I'll take them to go and eat them in the car.\"<br><br>So he handed me the bag, I took some napkins and wrapped the bottom, and took them with me. As we pulled away, I looked back and was so sad that this would be my only visit to Smoque during this trip to Chicago.<br><br>As I sat in the back row of the Sienna, with my Coke in the cupholder, I finished off the bag of fries in about 5 minutes and was completely content.

My combination platter of baby back ribs, and St Louis ribs with sides of macaroni and cheese and cole slaw was flavourful succulent and of excellent quality.

As a white, middle class suburban kid, this is an adventure! Fortunately, they're about 6 inches off of the Kennedy on Pulaski, so that's lowers the anxiety a bit. But then you pull in and the street seems full of signs that basically say, \"If you're a Smoque customer, don't even THINK of parking here!\" In fact, I think some of the signs said EXACTLY that. But after a bit of roaming around, we found a parking spot that didn't appear to have a \"TOW ZONE\" sign in effect -- at that moment.<br><br>With that friendly neighborhood greeting, we walked into Smoque. It's nothing special to look at on the outside, and not much better inside. There's a wall-covering blackboard with the menu, but it's starting to fade out, making it hard for noobs like us to decipher. Fortunately, my brother is a regular here, so I didn't need the menu.<br><br>Even at 1:30pm on a Wednesday afternoon, the place is jammed. The line is not out the door, and that's something. We order, a kid on the floor asks uhow many are in our party, and what our order numbers are. Every table is jammed and it looks like we're going to eat standing up.<br><br>15 minutes or less later, as the kitchen nears our number, the kid shows us to 4 seats, conveniently located in the corner and near the pop machine --perfect for me! 3 minutes later, our food comes out. I order the sweet jalapenos and head back to the table.<br><br>My first mouthful of chopped brisket is, well, awesome! Lots of smoke, crunchy crust, great beef taste, subtle complex BBQ sauce and perfect moisture. Cole slaw and fries are both really good, as are the beans.<br><br>I agree with my bro -- the brisket is the choice here, but my wife's pulled pork sandwich was great -- and the 1/2 sandwich was just the right size for her appetite.<br><br>We didn't feel rushed, even with 30+ people standing in the aisles waiting for a table. Overall, this place runs great -- they should give crowd management lessons to some other restaurants that will remain nameless. And to all my fellow melanin-challenged white kids out in suburbia, it's okay, nothing to worry about here -- c'mon down!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I have been going here for years, and I'm happy to say I think Smoque has managed to get even better recently. If you're reading Yelp and trying to evaluate whether it's worth the trip, pay attention to the outstanding 4.5 star average after nearly 3,000 reviews, which tells you far more than the handful of mediocre-to-negative reviews you can find here. No restaurant has 100% perfect consistency, and Smoque is no exception, but their range is from mind-blowing to, on their worst days, simply really good, and my last several trips were all in the former category. Have I just been getting lucky lately? I don't think so; I think their consistency is improving. For those that are giving sub-par reviews here, especially if they are saying the brisket wasn't juicy, I can only say you're depriving yourself if you don't give Smoque another chance.<br><br>Other reasons I say Smoque is getting even better: the Peach Cobbler, previously not sweet enough, changed for the better about a year ago. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a fan of overly sweet desserts, but the cobbler did not have enough sugar to feel like a dessert; they've obviously changed the recipe slightly and it is sweeter, but balanced well without sacrificing its complexity. But perhaps the most important recent improvement at Smoque (besides greater consistency on the meat) is the addition of a second, thicker and tangier sauce, so that now you get two generous tubs of additional sauce standard with each order. Their original thinner, more vinegary, and peppery sauce is still my favorite (I'm thankful they didn't mess with it!), but it's a near toss-up, and I love having both choices and just more sauce overall.<br><br>Full disclosure: I'm not an experienced ribs eater in general and therefore have little to compare theirs to. The star of the menu for me is their superbly tender, nicely seared, and mouthwatering brisket, which comes in either sliced or chopped form (don't ask me why, but I prefer sliced). Other protein choices: sausage is terrific, and high marks for the pulled pork and chicken, though I have less experience with those. The sides are mostly very good (mac & cheese, brisket chili, beans are my favorites, and the slaw has a nice light vinegar, not cream, base, perfect in the context of an otherwise heavy meal). Fries are excellent and plentiful, though personally I tend to avoid ordering them to avoid additional damage to the arteries (though I always secretly hope someone else in my party orders them so I can steal a few). Not many dessert choices, but besides cobbler, there's a great bread pudding with pecans and caramel sauce that has a great texture and depth of flavor.<br><br>Some of the less stellar reviews for Smoque are doubtless due to some people expecting something different, especially regarding atmosphere, so here are a few things to know when planning a trip:<br>1. It's BYOB.<br>2. The menu is not huge: beef, pork, chicken, sausage, ribs, and a few sides. They focus on doing a few things very well and efficiently.<br>3. This place does NOT have \"fun\" kitchy country-themed decor, nor a modern hipster vibe. The seating area and general atmosphere is clean, simple, and no-nonsense with simple wooden tables and chairs. It's about the meat here, not distracting decor.<br>4. The seating area is small, especially given the place's popularity at peak times. Come and sit, but don't expect this will be a place you should (or will want to) hang for an hour or more. Great for lunch or a stop for dinner on the way to something else, but you won't want to \"make an evening of it\" here.<br>5. I saw at least one complaint about this in the reviews here and yes it's true... you are not automatically given glasses of water when you sit down... because they do not have full table service (you aren't obligated to leave a tip, therefore). You can get water yourself from the soda machine, though. Is this really a problem?<br>6. Lines at peak times easily go out the door, though I'm generally impressed with how efficiently they move people through given how busy they are. Both the kitchen and front-of-house staff have got a streamlined system in place, but without it feeling rude or like you're being hurried out the door.<br>7. Some people have complained about parking, and it's true that at peak times you may have to search on one of the residential blocks to park, but honestly, all of Lincoln Park, Lakeview and many other neighborhoods in Chicago have FAR worse parking situations. I can only assume those complaining about parking here are coming from the suburbs (Smoque is right off the I-90/94 Irving Park exit and a lot of suburbanites stop by on the way to Cubs games).

C<br><br>Brisket: The only brisket I've had that was better than this was in Houston.  Amazing. Tender, moist and full of flavor.  Get this, even if you usually don't eat brisket.  A+<br><br>Texas Sausage: very good with a little bit of spice.  Way better than I was expecting, but not the star of the show. B<br><br>Mac & Cheese : While the serving size is small, the mac & cheese is creamy and tasty, baked so that there is some nice crust on the top to add texture.  As a mac & cheese lover, I can't give it an A, but it provides a nice balance for the sauces and well seasoned meat. B<br><br>Baked Beans: There is a unique taste to them. They are a little sweeter than I am used to and seem as if wine or Worcestershire was used. Another small serving, but good.  My girl was not a fan, but I was. This is my Yelp not hers, so there.  B+<br><br>Fries:  Hot and crispy, but nothing to slap your mother over.  Make sure you eat them fresh, they won't handle travel well.

This place has consistently rocked for years and that's not easy to do!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I've been going to this place for about 4+ years now. Since then there have been a handful of very good BBQ spots that have been opening up in neighboring parts of the city, but this is still my go-to spot when I want great BBQ. <br><br>My standard orders are usually brisket or St Louis ribs (sooo good!). The brisket is so tender that when you try to pick up a slice with your fork, it will fall apart if you don't get it into your mouth quickly enough. And friends that I have gone with also speak fondly of their pulled pork (personally I have never tried it), and when I feel like something else besides red meat, I go for their chicken. I know most people might think, \"Chicken? Really? If I'm going to get BBQ, I'm getting red meat.\" Well I've been here enough to want to change it up from time to time, and their chicken is EXCELLENT. Easily some of the juiciest, most flavorful chicken I have even tasted.<br><br>They also have pretty tasty sides. I'll start with their 'slaw. If you order a plate or sandwich, the 'slaw comes with it. Personally I think creamy 'slaws are disgusting, and until I went to Smoque I thought \"creamy\" was the only type of 'slaw out there. Smoque's 'slaw is vinegar based and is pretty damn amazing. Whenever I go, I get a large container to go, to have as a side with my lunches. Their beans, mac n'cheese and fries are all must tries as well. I'm not a fan off their cornbread, but I know some that are; and from what I hear their peach cobbler is pretty damn tasty as well. I've never had it, because by the time \"dessert\" enters my mind, I am stuffed! <br><br>I will say that if you're thinking of carrying out, you may want to have realistic expectations. I've carried out 3-4 times and EVERY single time, the meat is too rare on the brisket. I feel like they may just save the rarer stuff for the to-go orders since most people don't check their food until they get home. I'm not say that's 100% the case, but it's hard for me to believe that my luck is THAT bad. That being said, I've never been any less than absolutely satisfied, when I dine in... hence the 5 star rating. I'd recommend this place to anyone living in Chicago who hasn't tried it, and anyone passing through (and I actually did. I had family in town from FL a few weeks ago and I told them to go.

Everything from the baby back ribs to the smoked chicken raises the bar on what great barbecue should taste like. Indeed, the food here was so outstanding that my face hurt from smiling so much while I was eating. <br><br> However, the absolute star of the show was the smoked brisket - a juicy, fork-tender affair that tasted so delicious, it felt sinful to eat. Coming from a self-avowed \"pulled pork\" guy, this conclusion came bitterly at first but Smoque BBQ earned it.

The wait was roughly ~30 min to 1hr to order. Upon ordering, we were escorted to a table that was held for us by the hostess (or something similar to). Their food arrived on a metal tray.<br><br>This place is probably as good as BBQ gets in Chicago (and I'm a bit disappointed given Chicago has such wonderful food/restaurants/eateries). It's definitely not a top-tier BBQ place. The ribs, brisket, and pulled pork were OK, but could be quite dry and overcooked. The cole slaw was rather enjoyable with a vinegar-based dressing (I'm accustomed to mayonnaise being from the south). The brisket chili was nothing special, with the brisket not adding much to the party. The menu is also more pricey than I'm accustomed to paying for BBQ, but this isn't a large point given it's in/near Chicago. <br><br>I also found it odd how the owner (or who I presumed to be the owner) is sort of on watch over his customers. His interactions seemed a bit odd/strange, acting almost like a statue in the corner. If an owner is out on the dining floor, I'm usually accustomed to seeing him ask how things are going/how the food is. Instead he was just sort of...there... Also not a fan of the seating method, but I guess they need to sort people when there's a line snaking out the door. <br><br>With the price I paid, I would've preferred eating elsewhere as Chicago has a huge HUGE selection of places to eat. Smoque will satisfy the BBQ itch, but you'll need to go elsewhere for really REALLY good BBQ. Rewards on their wall also seem to reflect this, as I don't recall seeing anything that was non-Chicago awarded.<br><br>This is probably not the most valid point, but if you've got a car and a day, go to Pappy's in St. Louis.

The food stayed very warm until it was ready to serve about 2 hours later.  Don't throw away the containers though.  They charge an arm and a leg for them.  Eating this food made me go out and get my husband a smoker for his birthday last month.  I'm hoping he can replicate  some of the flavors of this place.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Always a \"must eat\" when we head to the city.

We ordered from a bored young girl who couldn't have looked more unhappy to be there. Within mere minutes, your number is yelled out for you to walk back up to pick up your tray. Okay, so in a deli, your food can be made-to-order within minutes, but BBQ? No. So the food is not made-to-order.

Far, far, far from the best we've had, but certainly not the worst...just meh. The main dishes were just...fine. Nothing to write home about, at all. Maybe they'd have tasted better if they hadn't been (barely) luke-warm. The sides were excellent, and I wish they were available as their own entrees. My boyfriend completely devoured their coleslaw (I'm not a fan of coleslaw in general), so that's also a plus in terms of sides (and comes included).<br><br>So, yeah. Cafeteria seating. Deli service (in the short time we were there, they went from yelling out 60 to the mid-80s - that's not impressive, that's a factory line of food...again, like a BBQ McDonald's). Food that isn't made-to-order. The entrees are overpriced, the sides are excellent. Disgustingly-sweet sauce. $40 for this? The equivalent of fast food? No, thank you, not with all of the legitimately incredible options out there. Guess it'd be alright for a quick lunch if you don't mind blowing $40-50 on lunch for 2. Their prices are ridiculously inflated for the quality of the food and the dining experience.<br><br>Maybe this is \"great BBQ\" for people who never venture out their own neighborhood.

It really is \"Meh\" and I really have experienced better. It's not A-OK, and I'm pretty certain that I'll never have a craving for it.

My boyfriend's sides included cole slaw - I absolutely despise cole slaw but here they make it almost sour - just cabbage, onion and vinegar, it was great in between bites, really crisp and cleansed the pallet.<br><br>When we finished eating, someone offered to take our plates and the next couple was seated.

The cornbread was good but they serve up the sides in little aluminum cupcake sized containers which are fine for most of the sides they have here but could be a little more generous when it comes to the cornbread.

The brisket and pulled pork were amazing too, both being flavorful and smoky, but didn't quite shine like the ribs. Out of the sides, the brisket chili was disappointing. The flavors were muddled and needed more seasoning. The fries were crispy and hot -- there's something about eating them out of a grease-soaked brown paper bag that makes that much more appetizing.

Toss the chicken and sausage off the menu. It has no place at a barbecue joint. I remember ordering my first hot dog with ketchup in Chicago. No one told me different. Down South, they would be even less polite. \"Did you say chicken, sir?\" \"If so, you have about 3O seconds to leave before my angry uncle put a brick bat upside your head and makes your eyes crossed.\" As for the sausage, sell 'em out of a hot water, hot dog stand. Common trash. Do the O'Mally's  live with the Vanderbilt's?<br><br>RIBS: wash yo hands because they so good, you'll smack yo mama. Excellent dry rub that isn't too salty like 98 percent of ribs. Seriously slow cooked as they must be. How can one tell? Put your plastic silverware down and pick it up like you're supposed to. Hold it by one end. Does it seem top heavy because it leans and perhaps even cracks and breaks in two. Of great importance, of all meats ribs are the easiest to cheat on. From this point forward, look at the fat on the exterior and between bones. Should be about 2O percent max. Score 9<br><br>BRISKET: For the most part, brisket is a fairly lean piece of meat. It is the toughest to tenderize because it's the thickest. If the middle is warm and moist with a black/brown, but not burned crust on top that is seasoned in a highly pleasing manner, someones doing something right. Here's a test for great seasoning. Scrape a little off with your knife and hold it on your tongue. Sure, salt is an ingredient, if it seems to be the largest ingredient, your eating at a poser's restaurant. I'm not a big brisket eater and often rely on what others say. I'd like to take my buddy Steve here once a week and order him brisket. It's the only time he don't constantly run that damn mouth of his. Score 8<br><br>The sport of kings: Horse racing. The meat of his heirs: PULLED PORK. So Smoque, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways. You and your pulled pork  can go toe-to-toe with anyone, anywhere, anytime. I admit, I was surprised and humbled by the people who would attempt such a dish above Interstate 4O. That stuff will make you want to fist fight a rude man just because everything else is right with the planet while enjoying meat that is of varying color which is normal. Yes, there can be a bit of grease. Guess what, take that away and you got beef jerky. It's like comparing a fillet with sirloin. Marbled means magnifique. Smoque's had less grease than any PP I've tasted. That means when the pork is pulled, they actually may discriminate against a few pieces. To come in Smoque's and not order PP is like going into Mike Ditka's and not eating the veal chop. The knowing chaps and chapettes  give each other a wink. All seven judges concur, even the contrarian Bulgarian judge. This PP is a 1O.<br><br>* CORN BREAD preference is like having a bias for a Ford F-15 or a Chevy Silverado. Regardless, you should wear a bag on your head if you don't eat cornbread with your barbecue. That sounds mean, but it's true. I like CB slightly sweet and crumbly without pieces of corn which is just plain nasty. <br><br>** PEACH COBBLER has somehow become a custom at a barbecue joint. It's tough to pull off. Peach season is 1O weeks long and even then, why fool with fresh because your customers are used to, and want, what you have been serving. I'm addicted to sugar so I have to have desert. My peach cobbler provided the strongest memories of Smoque. The line was backed out the door. I sort of stuck my head over the stainless steel into the cutting area of the kitchen. I shouldn't have done it, but I asked the cook if there was a way to get desert  without going to the back of that line. In two seconds, he produced the peach cobbler and said to pay later. The peaches were a four. The warmth was an 8 and the crust was a shocking 1O. You'll never guess one of the ingredients of peach cobbler. <br><br>Butter.

When I'm on the North side it will definitely be Smoque again.<br><br>Let's start with the meats. I had the Rib Combo (both Baby Back and St. Louis). They were cooked to perfection. As a BBQ Judge I have become very spoiled with perfect ribs, and these are perfect ribs. The meat comes cleanly off the bone where you bite, but it does not \"fall off the bone\" when you take a bite. The bone dries immediately. That's a perfectly cooked rib. As for flavor, it was fabulous. I asked for the sauce on the side so that I could taste the meat, and it was heavenly. I added some sauce and it just made me happy. Both the Baby Back and the St. Louis ribs are awesome. My wife had the sliced Brisket. It, too was awesome. Just a little on the dry side, but nothing to complain about. She, too, had the sauce on the side, and if they would have put the sauce on the meat, it would have been perfect. <br><br>The sides are great. We had Mac n' Cheese, Brisket Chili and Cornbread. The Slaw comes with the meal, too. They were all awesome. Mac n' Cheese was very cheesy, creamy, and not overcooked like many establishments. The Brisket Chili is almost as good as mine (seriously that is awesome Chili). Heavy on the Brisket, light on the beans. The Cornbread was sweet and moist, and delicious. And now the Slaw. Normally I like creamy Slaw, but this Slaw was fabulous. Sweet vinegar with red onions and cabbage. Simple, and simply divine. <br><br>One thing I really like about both of my favorite 'Que places in town is the fact that the owners take an interest in the customers. Barry was out working the crowd, he apologized when our meal was taking a little longer than he liked. He followed up with everyone in the place, and when I asked for a little Pulled Pork to go, he got me some. All in all it was a very great visit.<br><br>Now to that Pulled Pork. We live about 45 minutes away, so I knew the pork would be cold, but oh, how heavenly. The perfect amount of smoke, still very juicy, and tender.

Real neighborhood joints don't advertise, you either know about them or you don't. Also lets face it, a lot of people will not go to the south side. Hyde Park is as far as some people go or have ever been.

Shortly thereafter our number was called and we dug in. We sampled a bit of everything with the exception of the peach cobbler, ribs and chicken. <br><br>I chose the brisket, brisket chili (lay off me, I spent my formative years in Texas and I love brisket) and fries as my sides. My dining companions went with the pulled pork, cornbread and macaroni and cheese and the brisket and Texas sausage, baked beans and cornbread. <br>The brisket was delicious. It was juicy and surrounded by the most flavorful bark. It was so good, I let it go sauce-less. <br>The Texas sausage is another matter. On its own, it's good. It's spicy. But, it needs the sauce. It's almost as if it was made to pair with Smoque's sauce because when you put the two together, it's barbeque bliss. <br>The pulled pork was melt-in-your-mouth good. <br>But, I'm glad I chose the brisket. <br><br>And the sides were amazing! <br>The brisket chili is Texas chili at its finest. It was so well-seasoned and chock full of brisket, beans and tomatoes. I wanted to take a quart of it home so that I could slip into something more comfortable and get in some alone time with it. <br>The cornbread was sweet and savory, with kernels of corn throughout, and perfect for sopping up every last bit of the sauce from my plate. <br>The baked beans were super tasty but paled in comparison to the chili. <br>Now, I do not go out of my way for macaroni and cheese but Smoque has me singing a different tune. It was rich and topped with bread crumbs. It was so good your granny would be tempted to ask for the recipe. <br><br>Let us not forget the coleslaw that comes with all the platters. It's just cabbage and vinegar (apple cider vinegar maybe?) and perhaps some seasoning but it is fantastic. It's clean and simple and it pairs perfectly with richness of the meats. I loved it, loved it, loved it. <br><br>And the sauce is divine. It's the love child of Memphis barbeque sauce and Texas barbeque sauce. It's vinegary and spicy and the stuff Smoque makes will stay there forever if you dare to get it under your nails...<br><br>So get that frown off your face, Smoque's gonna replace it <br>with a smile and a dream come true.

Their website says otherwise of course, everything in this place is smoked and everything is smoked using varied woods depending on the dish (they expertly chose the right flavor combinations).
