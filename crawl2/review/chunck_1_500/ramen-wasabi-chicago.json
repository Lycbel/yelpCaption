I mean, holy cow (holy pig?)... I could stare into the depths of the fatty broth bubbles forever. This was an instant classic and I'm already craving it again. <br><br>My wife and I came in around 11:15am on Sunday and had no trouble getting a seat right away. When we left around 12:15, there was a small wait of one or two parties. <br><br>To pre-game for our ramen, we had some fried chicken buns. They were delectable but a little small for the $8 price tag. <br><br>For the main event, I had the Spicy Roasted Garlic Miso. As previously mentioned the pork broth insane. It's very traditional, very fatty, and very flavorful. The thick egg noodles were substantial; they had an awesome texture and bite, and were very al dente (I should probably learn the Japanese phrase for that).  The bowl is not all that spicy, so don't be afraid of it if you don't like spice. As you start eating it, it's barely spicy at all but it builds just a little as you work your way down. You will not experience any sweating or (enjoyable) pain from the spice here. The pork belly is also top notch... It is extremely tender, juicy, and flavorful. I'm normally apathetic about bamboo shoots and sometimes pick around them, but the version here actually had a good amount of spice that was different from the broth and I enjoyed eating them. <br><br>My wife ordered the Original Tonkotsu and added the umami spice bomb. This bowl was just as good as mine, maybe even better. Many bites were traded. The original bowl comes with thin noodles and mushrooms, whereas the Spicy garlic miso has thick noodles and bean sprouts.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/H0l09RatPa3Blse9PM-s-g/348s.jpg", "caption": "Original Tonkotsu"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2c6O6VG5YrhtlNnlqk8vaA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Fried chicken buns"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/L3DzcmjTtPR3t4XnXheNSQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "45 hour pork broth"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "This place is pretty damn good. <br><br>My friend and I are on the hunt for the best ramen in Chicago and we were both very impressed. I got the Hakata classic and it was perfectly balanced. Not very salty but without sacrificing flavor. One of the things I really liked was the meat was NOT fatty - some people may like fat but I prefer less since the broth itself is already creamy. While I enjoy some of the newer places that try to be creative with their ramen, I appreciate the simplicity of an authentic bowl of ramen which Wasabi provides. My bowl didn't try to dazzle me with overflowing toppings but instead had all the traditional aspects. <br><br>The one and only small complaint I have is I wish the broth was hotter or could stay warmer. It was fine at first but I felt like it cooled very quickly. My favorite place in Southern California (shin sen gumi) also seems to have this problem so idk if that's normal. <br><br>We have to try High Five ramen in the west loop before we make our final decision but Wasabi will be tough to beat!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8Mjg7PPwtV6n17Vo9zRRqw/348s.jpg", "caption": "Hakata Classic"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "This place is hip??<br>Food was good but not great <br>Service was poor, first he's nice but after took the order he just disappeared.. maybe we were a group of 6 and he can charge 20% for tip so he didn't return to our table to check up on us or anything. :(", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Ramen Wasabi has officially taken the number one spot on my list of best ramen places in Chicago.

The wait was about an hour long, but once seated the flavorous journey began. <br><br>We started off with edamame, two different types of buns, and drinks. My husband said his old fashioned was really good. I had a Moscow mule myself which was crisp and refreshing. It's probably really hard to mess up a mule, though. The buns were delicious! The chicken one has crispy chicken and the pork one had savory pork- both meats inside a light, fluffy bun. Yummy! <br><br>THE RAMEN: I ordered the Tokyo Classic Shoyu which proved to be my favorite bowl of ramen I've had to date. The chicken based broth had perfect flavor alone and adding spice to it took it to a whole new level. I also got some buttered corn on the side which I added in.

Egg looks like it is cooked just right (it was, confirmed when bit into). I judge tonkotsu ramen sometimes base on whether you cause a wrinkle on the broth's surface, and there was definitely wrinkling when I broke the layer of fat (like the congealed later from fish broth). So their ramen does have this congealed layer, which is great! Flavor is just right, not too salty or oily and very smooth. (My husband said the broth is not as dark as some we have tried, which sometimes is s good thing!) Noodles were clumped together, may have been sitting in the back for a bit so it clumped together, but texture is just right (actual ramen noodle, instead of instant ramen). Pork is the same as the pork belly buns, very tender, and the sweet and savory balance is on point. Other toppings are great complements - mushroom and bamboo shoots and of course scallion. The overall experience does get a bit overwhelming with the grease, so I asked for spicy sauce, and discovered spicy umami paste. <br><br>Spicy umami paste-- might have a sting at first, but actually sweet and flavorful, not overwhelming. It was served to me cold so it was a great complement to the warm pork belly. Highly recommend this combination! (Compared to furious spoon's spicy sauce, this is thicker and less spicy.)<br><br>Classic Tokyo Shoyu ramen-- my husband wanted a lighter flavor. It is not overly sweet, which is great because some shoyu ones I've had were too sweet. He said he'd prefer if they gave more meat in his. (Mine tonkatsu one had three decent pieces, so I was happy).

Spicy Tokyo Wings definitely have a kick. They were well cooked, and the flavor had a darker flavor that reminded me a little of gochujang (Korean red chili paste). The pork belly in the Pork Belly Buns was cooked well. The buns were a fusion twist of the traditional gua bao (Taiwanese pork belly buns), and had the usual cilantro and pickled flavors replaced with blander flavors like lettuce and mayo. The garnish could have been better distributed with the meat, to help add more variety and flavors with each bite. Both sides were prepared well, but left something to be desired.

I had a sip of the Tokyo Classic Shoyu broth which was surprisingly light and packed with flavor, a great alternative for those looking for a less oily and heavy dish.<br><br>There are some things I do miss about the previous location. It's nice that we are no longer elbow to elbow and talking loudly over the room, and it has a brighter, more modern atmosphere compared to the previous feel of the restaurant, which felt more hole in the wall and grudgy with its dimmed lighting.

I take my ramen pretty seriously as it's one of the dishes I enjoy eating the most. <br><br>I believe ramen needs to be assessed in a variety of categories (e.g., soup/broth flavor, consistency, accompanying ingredients, golden egg, temperature) but overall, I think the noodle quality in the chew and texture is should be the most heavily weighted criteria in a ramen assessment. Others may disagree and I can see how the soup/broth needs to be of extreme importance as it's one of the things that many places pride themselves on... but wasabi gets 5 stars for their noodles. Their tonkatsu broth is quite good and all of the accompanying items added great flavor - definitely add the kakuni (I know $4 upcharge is steep - but it's worth it). <br><br>Still, it's the wavy noodles and the way it picks up the flavor of the broth and has outstanding mouth feel that makes this a consistent and regular destination for me in Chicago.

And by amazing, I'm talking about the food. I went with my standard ramen order, the Tonkotsu ramen, and it was everything I wanted it to be. Rich, savory, creamy, and filled with great toppings. I would change nothing about this bowl. It's also worth noting that they serve what I think is the perfect noodles to broth ratio.<br><br>Next up, the raves about Pork belly buns. After reading reviews, I knew I had to get this. As someone who loves good pork belly, but finds nothing more upsetting than poorly prepared pork belly, I was very happy. The pork was flavorful, tender, and the fat was the perfect consistency- not chewy at all. I judge pork belly on a few things, but the consistency of the fat is right at the top because it can ruin a good cut of meat.<br><br>The wait was long, but that was expected and not a problem because it's a really good spot! Just note that the waiting area is \"compact\" so you may be standing out in the snow on a winter night. So dress appropriately! Again, not knocking them on this-- it's busy because it's badass.<br><br>The only thing I'd provide some constructive feedback on is making sure that staff issues and mistakes are dealt with behind closed doors (and not in front of patrons). The hostess was doing a great job of dealing with a super long wait, constant stream of people coming in, phone calls, and 15 people invading her space while waiting to be sat (rather than waiting out in the snow). Apparently one person was sat who said their whole party was there but they weren't and a server (or manager maybe) got annoyed and chewed her out in front of all of us waiting for tables. She wasn't loud, but we were packed so tight that it was awkward and obvious. And once she'd expressed her annoyance, she kept making the hostess feel bad about it. I imagine it was a stressful situation internally, but it was a bit awkward for us all. Not a huge deal, but something that might be better to mention and then move on, or talk about later.<br><br>Other than that, the service was good and it was a wonderful dinner of fabulous food!

Lack of standing room is a common theme at peak hours so get used to it.<br><br>With regards to the food, maybe I was visiting on an off day but the quality was a marked step below the standards I normally expect. We were told by our waiter that the Pork Char Siu was sold out, which was strange considering we had arrived half an hour after the doors opened on a Saturday.<br><br>I went ahead and ordered the standard Tonkotsu, but upon its arrival I was slightly dismayed. Yes that might be an over-reaction, but when I discovered that: the broth offered less viscosity than usual, the pork belly did not offer tenderness throughout, the bamboo was too al-dente, and the boiled egg was not as warm and gooey as I had come to know and love - it was figuratively hard for me to digest. Is it still a good meal? Yes, but it's a shadow of its formidable past self.<br><br>No longer does Wasabi hold the same place in my heart, and i'm unlikely to be a regular anymore.

Honestly I really wish I had come here sooner because they recently split the menus and you can only get sushi at the original location which is located next door. <br><br>With that being said I visited the newer location which only serves ramen and small apps. My boyfriend and I were in the neighborhood and we decided to wait until they opened for once. We waited about an hour right before they opened. You would be surprised that people were already lining up and waiting in their cars for this place to open. Anyhow, within 25 minutes of being open the place was packed. The service was a little slow as far as being acknowledged by the servers go. We waited about 10 minutes before anyone approached us. Finally our server came by asked if we had any questions about the menu and we proceeded to order.  they have a drink menu but don't have many non alcoholic beverages which was ok but disappointing, if you're dining with people who don't drink. Also I believe it's byob next door. <br><br>I had seen some chicken lollipops on another yelp review which we really wanted to try but they weren't on the menu. We ordered the spring rolls. I want to say they were chicken. This was my favorite thing I ate. The wrappers were golden brown and crispy, the filling was spicy but not overpowering, and the white sauce and fresh radish and micro greens gave it a refreshing and palate cleansing finish. Yummiest spring rolls I have ever tasted! <br><br>I got the tonkotsu ramen and my bf got the spicy roasted garlic miso ramen. Both are traditionally dressed with Pork and egg. I've had traditional Japanese ramen a few times before and I can say I loved the consistency of wasabi's broth the best. The broth is slightly thicker than most and extremely flavorful. I asked for hot chili oil on the side to add to my ramen as to control the heat. It was perfect. I like spicy but not over powering to the point that I can no longer eat it. My bf loves spicy food so the spicy garlic was great for him.  <br><br>For desert we asked for mango and chocolate chip mochi. The server who wasn't our original server messed up and brought us green tea and mango instead. Our original server came back apologized and we got to keep the messed up order on top of the correct order. I think that was very considerate of him, seeing as though I wasn't mad either way. Lol mochi was good. I really enjoyed he chocolate chip and mango. The green tea was ok. <br><br>Overall the food was great! The service kind of sucked at the beginning because we didn't have anyone serve us right away and everyone that had gotten there after us was already eating before we got our app. Probably lack of communication from front of house to servers. They need to be a little more organized. To be fair our server was nice and did provide good service. I'll be back but will probably go to the sushi side to try some of their menu items. <br><br>Oh almost forgot they play funky upbeat lounge music.

Was happy to say it did not disappoint, and in regards to traditional ramen broth, it is probably my favorite in Chicago as far as flavor balance. I tried out the Hakata red and the tokyu classic shoyu. While all their ramens aside from the vegan tan tan men have a pork bone based broth, the hakata is a less creamy variation compared to the original tonkotsu, while the classic shoyu substitutes much of the pork bone with chicken broth, offering a cleaner, less oily flavor. Both were delicious. The detail to the add-ons was likewise expertly done, with perfectly soft-boiled eggs and pork(both the belly and char siu) that was tender in both the lean and fatty portions, which melted on tongue and percolated throughout it for minutes afterwards.  The portions seemed on the smaller side when they first arrive, but that's more from the shape of the bowl; both me and my gf were full and satisfied by the end of the meal.

It was rainy. We were both coming off of colds.

No problem, we thought. <br><br>So we called an Uber. Waited in the rain. After 15-20 minutes of trying to tell the Uber driver how to find us, we gave up and jumped in the first cab we could find. <br><br>And then we hit traffic. And again: smelly. <br><br>We made it to Wasabi with about 15 minutes before closing time. Happily, we immediately got a table.<br><br>The very polite host/waiter told us that we needed to put in our order ASAP since they were about to close.

The. Best. Ever. <br><br>The pork broth was so luscious and creamy -- two words I never thought I would use to describe ramen broth. The waiter told us that they cook the broth for 45 hours. It was complex yet all of the different flavors -- umami, a bit salty, maybe even a touch of a weird sweetness -- worked together so well. <br><br>This broth was the equivalent of a warm blanket on a cold day. I wanted to curl up in it and never come out. <br><br>And in soup, the pork belly was so tender that it almost fell apart, and the noodles were the right firmness. <br><br>Wow, I'm really wanting more of this ramen now. Chicago is too far away! <br><br>The ginger salad was delightful, and the pork buns were expertly done. They may have also been the best that I've ever had, but the ramen was just too much of a star for me to notice.<br><br>I also had a piece of my friend's sushi. It was so fresh. <br><br>At one point the host/waiter came out to say that the kitchen staff would be eating while we were finishing up. He said he hoped that didn't bother us. We actually thought it was pretty cool to see the kitchen staff in the restaurant. He also took the time to chat us up about Wasabi's newer sister restaurant, Ramen Takeya, which specializes in chicken broth. He showed us several pics on Yelp of this new place. We loved him! <br><br>Knowing that they were closing for a couple of hours before dinner, we hurried up and finished our glorious meal.

A true food memory that I was lucky enough to share with the Yelp Lou community manager. We were both sick and looking for a late Chicago lunch option. We pulled up Yelp and searched Ramen.

Wasabi stuck out to us as it has almost triple the amount of reviews as some of their competitors - and now I know its for GOOD REASON. <br><br>We ventured stinky 20 minute cab ride up to Wasabi and made it with just minutes to order before they closed for lunch. We both ordered the traditional ramen, I added an umami flavor enhancement and a Philadelphia roll. The food all came out within 5 minutes.<br><br>First off, I was thinking to myself there is no way someone can execute this lengthy of a menu, plus a plethora of sushi options. Well folks, I took one bit of my sushi roll and the el coyote explosion cartoon when off in my head. I have NEVER tasted sushi this fresh (even on the coasts/Caribbean). Huge chunks of fresh salmon. They give you the option to order smoked or fresh. I was in complete shock over how clean these flavors were. Highly recommend. <br><br>Moving onto the ramen. I had the best ramen in NYC in a tiny grandmas kitchen underground and ever since that ramen has been on a pedestal in my mind. This ramen was verrrrrrry close. I'm not sure the umami enhancer really did much. I tasted Emily's without and it was similar in taste. Their broth is cooked for 45 hours and is already really flavorful, however their chili oil is what really boosted and brought out the brightness in the broth. The veggies, and pork belly were well executed and the noodles were the perfect texture. <br><br>We also had the steamed pork buns and that was just not even real. The pork belly was juicy and succulent and I loved how crisp the veggies were. <br><br>Everything in our meal felt intentional. The flavors were bright yet everything felt very controlled and clean. And that is a very hard balance to achieve. <br><br>We left feeling so grateful that they let us in with only five minutes to spare. To think we almost missed out on this meal makes me sick to my stomach! This was one of the best meals from start to finish that I have had in a long time.

I WANTED THE STEAK WITH ASPARAGUS, MY GIRLFRIEND HAD HER HEART SET ON RAMEN. My friend won this round, because it was her suggestion we eat there, and it was because she was craving ramen. While my ramen was delicious, I had literally been looking forward to their teriyaki steak and asparagus for days, only to discover at the door that it was one or the other. My friend even almost just went next door with me to give me what I wanted, but I wasn't ok with letting that happen. Until they can figure out how to make it an all-in-one type of place where I can order a hot dish AND my friends can have their ramen, lest I too, am craving ramen, there are plenty of places where the whole menu can fit in one room.

BYOB (Walgreens and CVS right down the street). Long waits so get there early to put your name down! There are a couple of bars that you can hang out in near by, the front area is small and unless it's warm out you might not want to stand outside. <br><br>Ambiance: Set up like many other ramen restaurants with the wooded booths, tables and chairs. Open kitchen so you might smell like food if you sit up at the bar, otherwise we didn't smell like food coming out of the restaurant. <br><br>Food: <br><br>HIGHLIGHTS: <br>small plates- takoyaki, pork buns, brussel sprouts, hamachi kama, pork skewers<br>ramen- spicy roasted garlic miso, tonkotsu <br>sushi- crabby wasabi, logan and artmex <br>dessert-mochi and chocolate dipped raspberry cheesecake <br><br>DETAIL: For everything listed above, I felt perfectly full. I thought it would be way too much, but it wasn't. However we had 5 people with voracious appetites, but you can always take home leftovers!...We had none. <br><br>SMALL PLATES: Porkbuns are a MUST! The bao buns were super soft and fluffy and the pork was delicious and tender. The out of towner we had with us refers to them as the \"fluffy taco.\" The brussel sprouts were incredibly flavorful and cripsy, gone in minutes, that's how good they were. The takoyaki was good, usually anything fried is, but my roommate who doesn't like octopus even liked it. It had a ponzu like sauce on top of a cream based sauce (almost like a sriracha mayo). The out of towner who's a bit of a picky eater and doesn't like octopus, did not like it however. The hamachi kama was good, it didn't seem like there was any seasoning to it, but had flavor to it. I've never had yellow tail, but it did seem to be more of a fattier white fish. Pork skewers were like big pieces of bacon on a stick, super fatty and delicious. It peeled right of the skewers making it easy to share. <br><br>RAMEN: The spicy roasted garlic really had a kick to it, that if i had a whole bowl to myself I probably would be sniffling the whole way through. I don't have a high tolerance for spicy foods, so I wouldn't be a good determiner of spiciness. Despite that, it had a bursting flavors. The tonkotsu was really tasty, probably one of the best I've had of all the ramen places I've been to in Chicago. The broth was incredibly flavorful and creamy and the noodles weren't too soft or hard, just perfect. <br><br>SUSHI: Of the three we ordered the crabby wasabi was my favorite. Soft shell crab is one of my favorite things in sushi, so I'm also a little biased in that regard. From the texture of the soft shell crab to the combination of flavors, it was delicious. The logan was my second favorite. I'm not a big fan of cream cheese in sushi, I feel like it's misplaced, or something about it with rice doesn't taste right to me. However, for this roll, the cream cheese was subtle and the combo of eel and shrimp tempura was bomb! I only wish that the roll was a little bigger. Lastly the artmex, not my favorite. I think it was the combination of jalapeno and fish that I didn't like. I like both food items, maybe just not together. I probably wouldn't order that roll again if I came back for sushi. <br><br>DESSERT: The mochi was pretty standard like most asian places, in terms of the flavor. The doughy part of the mochi was soft and not chewy. The mini chocolate dipped raspberry cheescake was really good, but when they mini they mean bitesized. Everyone who wants one can get their own, unless you only want a taste. <br><br>For 3 small plates, 5 pork buns, 3 oyster shooters, 3 sushi rolls, 2 desserts, 2 pork skewers and 2 orders of ramn we paid about $40 each for 5 people (gratuity auto applied for parties of 5 or more). <br><br>Service: Other than our water wasn't filled very often, no complaints.

My friend Brian put it down for a party of 5. We sat outside on the curb waiting for a good hour when a host came out and said \"Kathy, party of 5.\" She kept repeating it but no one from that group claimed it. We looked at each other confused, and I thought maybe Brian put my name down. I said \"I'm Kathy, party of 5!\" After we sat down, Brian swore he gave them his name, and we felt a bit guilty we were possibly taking someone else's table, so we told the host what happened. She reassured us it was okay, since they weren't present. We probably skipped two or three parties, but again, the host said it was okay since she'd sit them in a smaller table anyways. Pheww! It's a fairly small restaurant and I think table turnover is slow (blame BYOB), so we would've been very hangry if we had to wait any longer. <br><br>We brought a huge bottle of sake and some Sapporo. They supplied us with shot glasses and bottle chiller, and we kept taking shots of half sake/half beer throughout the dinner. It was just a good environment and so much fun!

Both were amazing!! The broth was perfect - not too salty like I find many ramen places. Each individual topping in the ramen had such a distinct flavor on its own, but then worked so well together in the ramen. I LOVED ITTT. The charred chashu is extra, but it's worth it! It was melt-in-your-mouth-good with a little smokiness that I've never had until now. I liked the tonkotsu a little better, just because I felt cleaner eating it. By that I mean the spicy roasted garlic made my earwax melt, nose run, and body sweat like I just did hot yoga. It really is spicy!! <br><br>We split the bill evenly among five, and it was $30 per person including tip.

I started feeling ill an hour after eating at Wasabi and was nauseous all night, waking up at 2 AM with the \"I feel like I'm going to vomit sweats\" and eventually having that come to fruition at 5 AM via projectile, aggressive, awful vomiting -- not to be too descriptive, but my stomach rejected that big bowl of ramen which it did not bother trying to digest a drop of overnight given the contamination of the food.  I continued to vomit all  morning and my temperature rose to 101.  For the next 5 days, I was unable to eat, drink, or stay awake - I felt like hell.  I had to miss two days of work, I had to cancel my spot at a charity event with my boyfriend (tickets cost $150 per person, so it cost $300 total), and I had to cancel on a work event with the head of my office (which was NOT good). Since I was so nauseous, I was unable to drink water without vomiting for 5 days, and I HAD TO GO TO EMERGENCY CARE. The doctor confirmed I had food poisoning, and even ruled out the flu (with that awful flu swab test). I was dehydrated and instructed to go to the emergency room for an IV the next day if the anti-nausea medication prescribed didn't work (I couldn't drink water without vomiting).  <br><br>I later called the restaurant to inform them of the situation and the response I got was \"we'd like to welcome you back in and we'll comp your next meal.\"  For real?  After those 5 awful days, I cannot even think about stepping foot into Wasabi again without feeling ill.  I incurred medical expenses because of this and I was nice enough not to file a lawsuit.  And to top if off, the owner didn't feel it necessary to speak with me, they decided to make a manager deal with it instead...so we had to play phone tag, as the manager had to check in with the owner on things. They later offered to refund my boyfriend the cost of our meal, but he informed me they did not return the money to his credit card.  I don't think they took this seriously, at all.  Eat here at your own risk, they don't care if their customers get hellaciously sick from their food.<br><br>*PS- I saw another review of Wasabi where someone else mentioned they had food poisoning for a week after eating at Wasabi.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Another win for Logan Square. If Wasabi isn't atop your \"best ramen in Chicago\" list, you're doing it wrong. Somewhat incredibly, I hadn't heard of Wasabi before a month ago. My best friend's sister's boyfriend's brother's girlfriend heard from this guy who knows this kid who's going with the girl who said that Wasabi's ramen was the only ramen she would eat in Chicago. Sold.<br><br>The Tonkotsu ramen: Legit. Authentic. Delicious. Rich, creamy broth. Springy, slurpy noodles. Perfectly soft-boiled egg.<br><br>I recently had the pleasure of eating at Orenchi over the summer, and Wasabi's ramen is as close as it gets in Chicago. The broth is a little too salty, and the pork not quite tender enough, but other than that, Wasabi's ramen is a dang fine replica. It's not cheap, and there's even an \"upgrade your meat\" option that gets your bowl into Andrew Jackson range. Pay for quality, I guess.<br><br>The rest of Wasabi is pretty neat, too. It's got an awesome \"trendy casual Asian\" vibe with plenty of hall and counter seating for ramen slurpers and sushi downers alike. It's also BYOB, so feel free to splurge on the fish without ringing up the alcohol expense.<br><br>We ordered a boatload of sushi and such in addition to my ramen sample, and everything was good. I particularly liked the ArtMex roll, a spicy tuna, salmon, and hamachi roll with a kick. All the nigiri was tasty and fresh, as were the crudos we ordered as appetizers.

Or at least open for lunch on a couple weekdays?  Your line is sometimes daunting but I'll just add you to my list of places where the wait is totally worth it. <br><br>Dined here with my monthly diners group.  It's first come-first served and it's not group friendly--meaning they only have one table that accomodates bigger groups, so your wait is going to be a longer one if you have a larger grouop.  Most of the seating is smaller tables and some counter seating. We came with 6 people and that is probably the biggest number you would want to dine with, unless of course you're renting out the whole restaurant and in that case, please invite me. We were offered a booth and since we were already waiting we took it. It was a booth and the hostess added a chair at the end--Thank you Osi V for volunteering to take that chair!<br><br>Anyway, they don't seat incomplete parties, understandable. The wait for our group was about 30-45 minutes on a Tuesday evening.  Yes, Tuesday. And there's not much room to wait in their vestibule. But Ramen and Pork Belly Buns are so worth the wait. <br><br>Our group likes to share so we got to try the Pork Belly Buns, several sushi rolls and bowls of Ramen.  <br><br>The dough of the pork belly buns was amazingly soft and mildly sweet--so reminiscent of my mom's Siopao dough--and it was a great vehicle for the savory pork belly.  I could have eaten 2 orders and maybe one day I will and I would feel no shame because they are so delicious. <br><br>The sushi rolls were also very good.  My favorites were the Super White, Pike Place and Shrimp Tempura. Well made, very fresh and the presentation was appealing.  <br><br>Now on to the real reason for the Ramen Season...Tonkotsu Ramen. Per their menu: egg noodle, rich pork broth, berkshire pork belly, soft boiled egg, marinated bamboo shoot, scallion, sesame, black wood ear mushroom, garlic oil They do not mess around with their Ramen. Ericka A and I split our order which we also upgrade with the extra grilled pork. The broth is rich and flavorful and the add-ins are perfect. I could have used more of the pork--because I love Japanese grilled/braised pork--but the split serving was perfect. So many textures and layers of flavor.  As of today, this is my favorite Ramen in Chicago. <br><br>The only reason I can't give 5 stars is the service.  Although friendly and laid back, it got more laid back and less friendly as our meal wore on. We are not a demanding group so maybe it was just later night ennui that got the best of them. <br><br>Anyway, Wasabi is BYOB so it makes for a very affordable evening out.   We each paid $30 (including tax and auto tip) for an amazing and satisfying meal.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I love this place!

You can successfully achieve this at Wasabi. If you order nothing else, get the Pork Belly Buns. They come 2 to an order, as one would expect when talking about buns. Get at least an order, but I won't judge if you get more. Close your eyes and go for the gold!<br><br>Our dinner group of 6 agreed that this was one of the best meals we've had in all our years of eating out together, and we go out every month!<br><br>My only real experience with ramen before coming to Wasabi was eating the 10/$1 Maruchan bricks throughout school and getting more elevated options at Mitsuwa Marketplace. But I'd never had magical 45-hour ramen before and I cannot wait to have it again!<br><br>If you're not about that soup life, their sushi is solid. We got a number of rolls to share. My favorites were Super White, Logan, and Shrimp Tempura. I personally did not like Crabby Wasabi because it tasted the way seafood smells in a grocery store. That's really the only way I can describe it. With that being said, a few at the table liked it. So maybe it's an acquired taste.<br><br>Our group split a couple orders of ramen, too. That was truly a treat. Aimee M and I went with the Tonkotsu Ramen and added some extra special pork to it for $4.50. Both of us agreed that even with the added pork, we'd have liked a little more meat. There were only 2 small pieces of the add-on and about 2 pieces of the pork it comes with regularly. Still, we were both able to get a couple small bowl's worth each. That's not too bad for under $20. It was so delicious!<br><br>Wasabi is BYOB, which makes it very affordable. After passing around Pork Belly Buns, sushi and soup, it came out to about $31 each after tax and automatic gratuity (groups of 5+) were added. We left very satisfied!<br><br>The two areas in which we all agreed we'd like to see improvement were:<br>1) Regulation of temperature<br>- We were seated almost all the way to the right after you enter. We were in back, closer to the bathrooms, and most of the time we were very cold and unsure if it was drafty from the door up front being opened so often or if they were blasting the AC. However, about 3 times during our dinner, the heat was turned up and we went from shivering to sweating profusely. It was very odd.<br>2) Timing of service<br>- The start of the meal was timed out very well. We were given time to browse the menu and they opened up our bottles of wine. We ordered the appetizers and they came out very quickly. We were barely finished with the first round of rolls before more showed up. Unfortunately, we then sat there for the majority of our 2 hour time there waiting for the ramen and the servers didn't pay us much attention after it was brought to us. We had to flag someone down to pay the bill.<br><br>In the big scheme of things, our complaints aren't major. Prepare to possibly wait a while to be seated since they don't take reservations, be prepared and wear layers whether you're indoors or outdoors, and you should probably order your ramen immediately and then space out the heavier appetizers and the rolls in case there's a lag.

Our wait was only about 5 minutes, so I would recommend going with smaller parties as it seems to be the ticket to faster seating.<br><br>Our server was attentive and knowledgeable. He made sure to ask if we'd been there before, and about our experience with ramen. I'm ramen obsessed but it was my friend's first time, so he found the waiter's description and recommendations helpful. We started with the pork belly buns - SO good! The buns were fluffy, and the belly melted in my mouth. I wish it had been a little bit more seared on the outside (same with the pork belly that was in the ramen), so that it would've been crunchy on the outside, and soft, melty, on the inside, but it was still really good regardless. Definitely a must have item during your meal. Also had the tuna tartare, and really enjoyed it because I love all things tartare. However, this isn't a must have for the meal as it wasn't overly unique from other tartares that I've had previously.<br><br>My friend and I both got the spicy garlic miso base for our ramen, and it was everything that I generally love in my ramen - layers of flavors between the miso, garlic, and spice. I do wish they had provided two halves of the egg because it's one of my favorite components of ramen. The noodles were thin, and springy, and went well with the base. Definitely a bowl I would both recommend and order again.<br><br>Rounded out our meal with mochi - got the green tea and the mango. Would recommend the fruitier flavors because it's just more traditional that way.

Waiter didnt give any recomendations and didnt discribe menu items jus was a very poor waitress proper training should be implemented waiter only came to drop things off n pick up money. I feel there is way to many items on the menu. It should be cut in half to focus on certain dishes perfecting them not jus havin a bunch of okay dishes. The appetizers should be enhanced  werent really any standouts. There should be different flavors of ramen like a seafood one or other unique flavors would be unique. Make better desserts cause a cheese cake is to plain. Also portion sizes are really small for the price best tasting ramen but if u fixed the issues it could really be one of the best tasting restaurants in Chicago i like the aditon of udon noodles u should make it more visible so people could know cause thats the new trend  <br><br>Pork belly bun: only two come in an order. I like my pork belly more cripsy this was a lil to flabby but still delicous. It needed more of the sauce though because its sweet and it counter acts the saltyness of the pork belly. Really was good but i like the pork belly bun at oiistar better i would recommend that u order extra sauce on the side<br><br>Fried takoyaki [be warned temperature wise hot](octopus puff which means fried octopus) picture a fried mushroom u get at a pizza joint but a billion times better it is so good!!! Omg i was shocked at how good this was. the octopus was cooked perfectly not rubbery at all the japenese sauce was nice n sweet n the mayo and all the other sauces really made this so rich. The bonito flakes were a nice touch to but they were a lil to dry so they were old<br><br>fried chicken lollipop: the sauce was really good it tastes like ranch dressing. I wish the actual chicken was seasoned more but it was still good. It was really greasy so it wasnt cripsy like the plate was covered in grease n it wasnt that tender good though jus they need to make this dish better<br><br>Spring roll: omg so cripsy!!! The filling was so delicous this was really good i was really surprised. Must order picture like a eggroll but 100 times better n more crispy <br><br>Spicy roasted garlic miso: omg omg omg best ramen ever! The broth is so rich. The pork flavor was orgasmic like really u know they spent a long time making the broth. Tje condiments were really good i hate when they put unnecessary stuff in soup. The spicy level is perfect but i was hoping it was spicer. The egg however was overcooked if its overcooked dont serve it to the customer. The pork y was really delicous get it with aburi kakuni! Its torched pork belly!! Omg so fucking orgasmic! The noodles were good. This was by far the best ramen i ever had only thing though i wish there was more in it though for the price they should really fill up the bowl<br><br>Uni shooter: this was actually really good im surprised when u get it u cant really see whats inside it looks like muddy water but omg there is so much flavor goin on there are so many wonderful ingredients in it that make it wonderful if u never had uni or dont like it this will<br>Make u like it. I wish there was a quail egg in it though but other then that great<br><br>Niku soup/ tempura soup with udon noodles: its the same broth just different meats in it. The broth was so rich and delicious. I was really surprised since it wasnt made our of pork like the other ramen dishes if u dont want to eat pork this is a good <br><br>Chocolate cheesecake: omg so good it was a lil to frozen for me i hate when restaurants serve u desserts straight from the freeszer. the flavor was good chocolate good quality texture was good the sauce was so deliocus perfect sweet/ tart balance<br><br>expresso cheese cake omg this was so good better then the chocolate. What i liked there wasnt to much of a coffee flavor which i domt like theres a rite balance of flavor the only thing i dont like about the desserts is there small <br><br>redbean icecream: i always try unique icecream this was really good idk how to describe the flavor jus order it lol it was really good not to sweet", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aYtYotQ3rTPpyGYirBkgyQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "Pork Belly and Kimchee Spring roll berkshire pork bellykimchee, glassnoodle micro greens house tartar sauce really good crispy$8"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PIlS5H6PlRW0Wp362jLmqw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Takoyaki(fried octopus puff) omg so good picture a better fried mushroom so delicous!!!!

There are only two things on the menu that we have ever gotten - the pork belly buns and the spicy garlic ramen. Tonight we ate here for the first time since they expanded. His ramen came first and I had to wait 10 mins for mine.. this has never happened before but hey, they're working out their kinks. It's no big deal. Once my ramen comes out I notice that the soup base looks like it's just miso.. not a hint of red. A taste test confirmed that the broth tasted really off. Bland and lacking the spice. The boyfriend tried it and agreed. We flagged down our server and I explained that the soup didn't taste the way it normally does. Definitely garlicky but absolutely no spice. The broth is usually an orange-red color and this time it was white. Our server said \"people order this all the time and it looks right to me\" (Uhh a little defensive maybe?) But.. it doesn't look right. Nor does it taste right. After going back and forth she finally offered some kind of solution and brought me some chili oil. After I added it to the soup, I got the familiar orange color and it tasted a lot like it usually does. She came back to check if it was better which I really did appreciate.<br><br>When the check came out we noticed they charged us for the chili oil. You're kidding, right? I understand that if I wanted extra there is an extra charge, but never have I been to wasabi and asked for extra spice to my spicy garlic ramen because it used to be on point every. single. time. My boyfriend asked them to take the charge off and they literally argued with him about how extra chili oil is an extra charge. I don't care about an extra charge that makes no difference in my bank account but the way they handled this situation was so embarrassing and disappointing on their part. <br><br>They are clearly messing up this ramen recipe and went downhill on their servers.

It doesn't come with an egg, but you can add one! The broth is really amazing - I even converted my brother who adds an egg and a pork belly to it (which really confuses the waiters haha).

She recently told me that ramen isn't really Japanese. It is originally Chinese and it was improved upon in Japan where it was a fad - similar to the fondue craze in the United States. M continued that ramen is no longer popular in Japan. Now ramen has made its way across the Pacific Ocean to the U.S. of A.<br><br>We purposefully went to Wasabi for their infamous ramen. It was delicious. We shared the Tonkotsu Ramen for $13. There was definitely enough for both of us and we slurped it right up. At first M was skeptical that there wasn't butter in it like her exemplary experience in Japan; however, she quickly got over that expectation. The Tonkotsu Ramen was a model of savory and the broth was rich, a little thick, and a tad creamy.<br><br>We also shared $7 House Made Dumplings (they were alright) and $4 Edamame. I think it's fair to say that the ramen is Wasabi's shining star. It might be noteworthy that the ramen section of the menu was pretty small compared to their large amount of sushi and maki rolls. In fact, the sushi and maki rolls took up an entire side of the laminated menu! We've tried about six rolls (including our server's favorites) and none of them were good. They were pretty bland and the fish was mediocre quality.<br><br>Our server was cute as all get out. We really enjoyed her personality and appreciated her descriptions of menu items. It was plain to see that she was serving a large portion of the restaurant and was possibly frazzled. She had to be reminded of a couple of things and even forgot our check. Our entire bill was $30 for the two of us!<br><br>One interesting observation was that there was a lot of ethnic diversity in Wasabi. The front of the house staff were Americans (white and black) and the chefs were Mexican and Japanese. The guests were just as diverse and we enjoyed hearing at least four languages while we ate our food at the bar.<br><br>Wasabi is most assuredly casual and good for groups and individuals. The decor was artistically industrial - more functional than eye-catching. At first we were seated at a small table closely neighboring another one with children.

The Shoyu ramen broth was flavorful and [pork] buttery in a balanced way that wasn't too fatty. There was a good proportion of noodles and toppings to broth, but for those who enjoy more meat in their ramen, the two pork slices in mine were slightly smaller than the size of a business card. I do commend them for being generous with the green onions (which I personally like to round out the deeper flavors of ramen).<br><br>The service was decent, and I received my food quite fast.

Kinda hipster.<br> <br>Here's my take:<br> <br>Hotate adburi: A lightly toasted scallop. This was.. wow. Creamy. a dash of soy, a dash of salt. Perfectly balanced. Good deal of meat.. ugh. I could do this again, and again.<br> <br>Oyster shooter: a layer of complexity. a hint of ponzu. quail egg. and even masago or some other roe.. along with a delicate, delicious oyster.  Yes, it's a shooter, but it's anything but a shot of simplicity.<br> <br>Short rib beef skewer:<br> <br>Honestly, most filet mignon's or other steaks I've encountered in restaurants (unless they're established, prime cut, gourmet steakhouses) have been cooked much more poorly than these simpler cubed bites of goodness.  These cuts are the way any steak should be made.  All juices retained with a rustic note, appreciating the cut of meat.

The bamboo shoots... hmm.... I get scared because I don't like how they taste out of the can, and when i kept biting piece by piece, I subconsciously kept looking for that \"tinny\" flavor. I don't think this was canned, necessarily... but I probably could have done with less than there was in the bowl.  The bowl was dressed with scallions, which added color, but was otherwise dismissible... I also love mushrooms, and this had a wood ear type. Scattered throughout, but very mild of an addition to be of note.

Guess what, we had a fantastic time on the sushi side of the restaurant. Great service, great food, just like it had always been. <br><br>Then we go next door to get our ramen on, the 5 of us are squeeze into a booth made for 4 people (we would have had to wait another 30 minutes for a proper table). Our server comes and takes our order and then he disappears for almost the remainder of our time there. We had to hound him down to find out where one of our drinks were and he didn't even deliver our ramen. One bite in and the noodles are undercooked. Reminiscent of al dente pasta, the pork belly was decent but nowhere near as good as it used to be. Just overall depressing. <br><br>I miss the tiny little ramen spot that was too cool for school.

I highly recommend", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "WE WENT FOR THE YAKITORI BUT STAYED FOR EVERYTHING ELSE<br><br>What is the answer to the question, \"Where can I get good Yakitori in Chicago, IL?\" The answer is, \"San Diego, CA\", so, really, \"Nowhere\".<br><br>We were downtown for the weekend to indulge in a food week binge. Having eaten just about every other tasting menu cuisine (hopefully I'll get to those reviews too in short order), I asked myself what was missing from our lives on Sunday morning. The answer, yep, you guessed it, Yakitori.<br><br>Perhaps I am too much of an optimist. Perhaps my memory is failing me in my old age. Perhaps I want it THAT badly that I keep hoping it'll turn out better. But we have been disappointed time and again in our search for Yakitori in Chicago. <br><br>Now, I know that a lot of you think that it is available. I have read your reviews. However, the only people who I will trust are our Korean friends. But they have to date been a bit hazy about the specific locations and names of the spots with which they taunt us. So, no, I am NOT talking about chicken breast and filet and asparagus on sticks. I mean guts; chicken guts; pig pieces. In Yakitori, if it isn't offal it's awful!<br><br>While the Wasabi selection of Yakitori shown on-line didn't look awesome, they at least had chicken skin and a few other semi-interesting things. It didn't turn out well. They ran out of chicken skin Yakitori just before our order was placed. However, according to our knowledgable wait staffer, they do offer interesting things but it is in limited quantity and as hit-or-miss daily specials about which I am not sure how to learn in a timely fashion. I'm now following them on Twitter (@wasabichicago), so hopefully that will help get us connected to the good stuff.<br><br>The two or three Yakitori items that we tried were very tasty and well prepared. So it bodes well for the chicken skin and potential specials. However, they just were not exactly what we wanted.<br><br>This disappointment aside, the rest of the HUGE menu, not to mention the specials, vaulted Wasabi to the top of our new favorites list! The disappointment in Yakitori was forgotten in the riches of specials, sushi, and sashimi that we tried.<br><br>To start, as for any positive \"sushi\" review that I provide, I will state that whoever picks out the fish at Wasabi is an expert, a true Itamae. Well, OK, I don't know if that statement is literally true since the Japanese have a lot of rules about things like that. I am sure that there is a very specific, very process, experience, and/or certification centric, very Japanese definition of what constitutes \"true Itamae\". My point is, the fish quality is AWESOME at Wasabi and whoever picks it out knows fish.<br><br>The fish diversity is even better. They had fatty cuts of THREE kinds of fish: tuna, salmon, and yellowtail! Whichever one we ate last (and we ate several rounds of each) was the best, no matter in what order we ate them! And, OMG, they had MONKFISH LIVER! You don't see that all that often even in SF's Japantown! I think that I had only ever had it at one, very upscale, location in Chicago. I took down three orders of that on my own. I wasn't sharing! It's OK. She doesn't really like it all that much outside of our special little spot in SF. Ooh...almost forgot the Hamachi Kama...mmm!<br><br>So, go for the Yakitori and maybe you will get lucky but I am guessing the fish is going to rock EVERY time. Everything that we tried was awesome. Just don't forget your sake. We did. Wasabi is BYOB.  OK, more to the point, the night before we ran out of the three bottles that we had brought downtown so we probably didn't need any anyway.<br><br>I would be remiss if I did not mention a few other highpoints before closing. First, our wait staffer was knowledgeable, efficient, and fun. She added to our enjoyment of the experience. Second, they have the kinds of Japanese ice creams that we like for dessert: black sesame and red bean. The latter was really good, the former were a sort of average mochi...but still black sesame and you just can't get that...well...anywhere, after our tiff with Ramen-san on the topic.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Very good food, but kind of confusing service.

My eyes couldn't stop admiring the perfectly composed ingredients of braised pork, fresh green scallions, and sunshine-yellow egg, that was resting atop of a sea of hot, steamy noodles. As I glaze over the steam-billowing noodles, my nose couldn't help to enjoy the great aroma coming from the broth. As I take my first slurp, my tongue couldn't stop dancing to the great mixture of flavor, as it alternates from bites of pork, egg, and noodles.

We arrived around 6 on a Sunday night, and there was already a line out the door. We put our name down and was quoted about a 30-40 minute wait, which wasn't that bad relative to what I was expecting. The only problem is they don't allow you to wait inside, and they didn't take down your phone number so you couldn't really go far. Everyone pretty much had to wait outside in the cold. We decided to hang out in the car for a bit, and after checking in again after 20 minutes, I found out they already called my name and skipped over us. I panicked for a second and thought they'd drop us back to the bottom of the list. Luckily they were super cool about it and said we would get the next available seats. After waiting a few more minutes, the hostess felt bad we waited so long and just straight up gave us a whole booth just for the two of us. Score! <br><br>I knew exactly what I wanted to order once I saw the word garlic on the menu. I ordered the spicy roasted garlic miso ramen and I took our waitress's suggestion and added the aburi kakuni, which was described as charred pork belly. Best. Decision. Ever. Hands down, this was the best pork I've had in any ramen I've tried so far. I couldn't tell which was the aburi kakuni and which was the berkshire pork belly bowl, but all I know is that every piece was damn delicious. The pork belly was torched on the outside to crisp the edges of the fat, and it had a fatty center that just melted when it hit your tongue.  <br><br>Whenever I eat ramen, my judgement of whether I like it or not probably comes mostly from my opinion of the broth. After trying High Five a few weeks ago, I didn't think any other broth in Chicago could compare...but Wasabi comes pretty damn close. It seriously matched the extreme richness and deep flavored, meaty essence that I was looking for. On top of that, it had both a mild spice element AND a dominant garlic flavor too. Pinch me. I can't really ask for much more than that. They seriously took everything I love and combined them into a single bowl of glorious ramen.  <br><br>Between the euphoria caused by the pork belly and the rich broth, I almost don't even remember what the noodles were like. I'm sure they were also pretty solid. The ramen was finally topped with roasted garlic chips and a perfectly cooked egg that had the most liquidy yolk. My only knock would be that they only gave half an egg. Really? You can at least afford to give us the whole egg. <br><br>Overall, I can't say enough good things about Wasabi.

I went with the pork belly buns to start off and thought they were cooked to perfection. The bao came out steaming hot and had the perfect airiness/fluff to it.

I almost wanted to give 4 stars because they didn't give me enough broth. Almost.... :) The broth was so flavorful and was definitely one of the best tonkotsu broths I've ever had.

I definitely could've gone for the thicker piece that gets torched to perfection.

The pork is extremely tender and the flavors are all great. However, the noodles are a little harder than I would like them to be and I didn't think anything about the broth was out-of-this-world.

Wasabi provides you with a water jug so you can refill yourself without them having to do it for you constantly. Which would be nice except that it was approximately 90 degrees in there yesterday when we went (no A/C! just one big fan!) and the four people in my group went through the bottle pretty quickly. It took twenty minutes to get a new one the first time, and we only got it when my SO basically shoved the empty one in our waiter's face (actually I don't think it was even our waiter, because our waiter went MIA for 20 minutes at a time). The second time our bottle was empty, we didn't even try to get more because we had mostly finished eating at that point. I was still very thirsty though and it would have been nice to get more water.<br><br>The service was probably the slowest I have ever experienced. We were at Wasabi for TWO hours. That would have been fine if we wanted to stay and drink and talk, but we honestly just wanted ramen quickly. My friends and SO all had things to do early the next morning and we did not want to spend that long eating ramen. And like I said, we never even got water refills or anything like that.

And to top it all off, we paid with FOUR credit cards, just splitting the total between us (we didn't make them do specific amounts on specific cards or anything) and we were only brought back TWO of them. It took us another few minutes to track our waiter down to ask for the other two credit cards, and he insinuated that we were lying to him and that he brought back all four.

Anyway, the miso was porky and spicy, no complaints there. The noodle however, was suspiciously curly and I initially thought they were using packaged instant ramen, but it also had the al-dente chewiness of ramen that the processed ramen didnt have. I was pretty impressed and this was as good away from tokyo as it would get, right under Strings though. I wouldn't put anything past Strings.<br><br>The takoyaki is a must try, they really don't skimp on the octopus chunks inside these savoury skillet-cooked dough balls.

When I have people visiting, I know I can count on this place as a crowd pleaser, so long as that crowd isn't too big because it's a pretty tight space. In the past year I switched to a plant based diet. Before then the Tonkotsu ramen with an added side of Chili oil would be my choice, before that my favorite was the Spicy Roasted Garlic Miso. Other favorites included: Artmex Maki, Pork Buns, Pork Spring Rolls, and Brussels. The lunch special on weekends is a good deal! My guy and I used to get the sushi lunch which came with two rolls, a salad (or soup) and a small scoop of green tea (or red bean) ice cream. We'd get a bowl of ramen and spit everything. It was the perfect amount of food. As a meat eater this place is absolutely 5 stars on every level!<br><br>I'm grateful that they have a vegan ramen. It's pretty good, but I don't care for the seitan ragu. I like Upton's seitan, but in ramen it gets super chewy and is a weird texture contrast with the rest of the ingredients. Judging by how good they do everything else, I think they could do a better vegan ramen. I'd be nice if it included more veggies. I get it with mushrooms, bamboo, and sprouts. I end up paying a lot more than I did as a meat eater by the time I add on those items. They don't do substitutions, so I have to pay for tofu or mushrooms in place of seitan, which is worth it because it's better imo. Considering it's more expensive ($14) than all other ramen on the menu aside from the Spicy Garlic Miso (which has a ton of ingrediients), I really think it should have some other veggies besides bok choy. By the time I'm done I have a $18 bowl of ramen. Maybe those buckwheat noodles are pricey, it's just hard to imagine they cost more than Berkshire pork belly. But again, I REALLY am grateful they have a vegan option. I still get the brussels, which are super (they are cooked in the same fryer as fish just an FYI)! As a plant eater, the ramen is a 3.5, but once I add the extras in, it's a 4. I love their house salad, the dressing is the best!! The vegan ceviche maki is also a favorite, it's usually on the special menu and only $7! That kinda makes up for my loaded ramen price, haha! One of these days I'll get around to trying the Hot Yogi Vegan Maki.<br><br>Service is usually very quick and polite. Love the BYOB, no fee. I don't drink much, but it's nice if I'm taking people out. I came one time with my little sister who the doctor had recently just put on a restrictive diet while trying to figure out some GI issues. Brian was our server and he was AWESOME! So I've been meaning to give a shoutout to him. Truly helpful at answering allergy questions and ultra accommodating and patient.

So here it goes: <br><br>First, the positive: <br>1. Their ramens are alright - try the one with spicy miso broth. Ramens come relatively quick (at least for the times I've been there).<br><br>2. They have lunch specials at a decent price. <br><br>The negative: <br>1. Everything else except for the ramen could take 15-40 mins to come out (and the place was not very busy at the time trust me, we went at an off hour). By the time my sushi platter came out, my friend had finished his 2nd bowl of ramen, and I had lost my appetite. <br><br>2. Honestly their sushi rolls and Chirashi Donburi (priced at $29 by the way) weren't stellar at all, average at most. <br><br>2. For 2 visits now, we've had an EPICLY confused lady for a waitress that slowed everything down an extra 5-10 minutes. Horrible. <br><br>3. Our throats dried out waiting for a water refill. (OK they did not dry out but you get the idea.) It looks like there's a separate group of people from the waiters that serve you water too! <br><br>4. The green tea ice cream that comes as part of the lunch special took God knows how long to come at the end of everything. After waiting a good 10 minutes after we've signed our checks and are itching to leave and get on with our lives, we left. Seriously, I don't know how scooping an ice cream could take so long. It should've come before our checks! <br><br>5. You cannot order a ramen to go. But you CAN order a bowl, let it sit on your table for 5 mins, then ask for a container to go. They don't have a good way of packaging the ramens so they don't change the taste maybe?

The wood ear mushroom in the Tonkatsu is a great addition that should be replicated in other restaurants versions. The Tonkatsu broth was only Meh and was too light in flavor, but the $2 flavor booster you can get really rounded out the broth. The miso broth had a great flavor off the bat and was our preferred choice. The noodles were pretty good, but cooked al-dente, seemed to be more of a poor man's version of Strings noodles.

Not a good start, but we didn't complain, we were still going to enjoy ourselves. The roll and ramen was delicious! I added the upgraded pork belly and umami to the ramen, and just a heads up, the umami is not THAT hot, comparable to siracha. <br><br>At one point, while our glasses were empty, the waitress lifted the wine bottle to see if we had finished it, which we hadn't, and put it back in the chiller without filling up our glasses. At another point, when we had finished eating I asked her to wipe off my side of the table because it was wet and there was food all over (I'm not necessarily the cleanliest when it comes to eating) and she noticeably gave me this \"really?\" look, which both of us clearly noticed. So we finished our meals and then ordered dessert. After dessert the waitress came by more frequently and gave that unspoken \"nudge\" about finishing up. I was a server for 6 years, so I notice these things and completely respect them. <br><br>With our wine not even finished, the host came over and asked us to move along because \"people were waiting\". We had been seated for about 2 hours and there was NO ONE waiting. Literally. NO ONE. I understand servers need to flip tables to make money, but really? Did you just ask us to leave?? I have never seen anyone asked to leave a restaurant because they sat for 2 hours. As a matter of fact, the only time I've ever seen people asked to leave was when the restaurant was closing, like shutting off the lights.<br><br>Anyways, I'm still giving 3 stars because the food was great.

But hopefully this review will help slowly rewire the way you (and we, collectively) think about ramen noodles. <br><br>While never having the benefit of eating ramen in Japan, I have never turned down a good ramen shop, be it NYC, Chicago, or Hawaii. and WASABI in Logal Square ranks at the very top.<br><br>I had a Tonkatsu Bowl ($13) with the braised and torched pork belly (an extra meat for $4.50)<br>Let's break it down by component:<br>1. Tonkatsu Broth - very smooth, a little creamy. I say a little because I don't want you to think it's heavy. The texture is extremely elegant (if you could describe a liquid this way). Full of flavor - something you won't know unless you try it yourself. When you compare this broth to other ramen shops, it comes out ahead because it is not as salty, not watered down, but also not too heavy. It is frankly, spot on.<br><br>2. Noodles - ok, here is where the confusion begins. Ramen noodles here look like the instant ramen noodles you unwrap and throw in the microwave or on the stop top, but the similarities end there. My buddy loves to eat, so he actually ordered a second bowl of noodles with his bowl because he ate them all so quickly. I tell you this because we had the benefit of tasting the noodles MINUS the broth. And what a world of difference. Swimming in the elegant pool of deliciousness, the noodles assume the character of their liquid companion. You don't miss a beat when you bring the noodles to your mouth either by chopstick or floating in your giant wooden spoon (a fun little eating utensil). The naked bowl of noodles demonstrated to me that the noodles to have their own distinct taste. The noodles have a good bite to them and are nice a squiggly like you expect them to be.<br><br>3. Pork Belly - the pork might be the real star of this show. So succulent, and fall apart at the bite delicious. I really like pork belly and this was one of the best pork belly experiences I have had. Again, cast against a strong broth that is not too salty or overpowering, you can still taste the uniqueness to the pork. <br><br>4. Braised and torched pork belly (the kukuni pork) - two additional piece of pork, while might seem expensive, were well worth the added cost. A very different taste and texture than the regular pork belly. The kukuni is equally as soft and gentle to the bite, but must be bitten with the grain to get that fall-off-the-bone experience. There is a little sweetness to the kukuni and it really shines against the other elements to the dish.<br><br>5. Half of a hard boiled egg + bamboo shoots:<br>Wife: \"oh my gosh, these bamboo shoots are delicious\"<br>Friend: \"OH MYGOD. These bamboo shoots really are good!\"<br>Me: \"wow, this egg is soooo good\"<br>Here's why: the bamboo shoots are very tender. As someone who has had the unfortunate pleasure of eating a lot of Chinese food accompanied by the panda's favorite snack, I can safely say these are the best bamboo shoots I have ever eaten. and let me tell you something:; no one likes bamboo shoots..but you will when you eat these.<br>The egg: I don't know how this was prepared, but the yolk is not hard, it's runny. I popped the whole thing in my mouth. Full of flavor and silky smooth. My wife didn't think it was as good, but she took it in bites, and I think eating it all at once is the better option because you experience every part of the egg all at once.<br><br>if this hasn't convinced you to go and try this place, I don't know what will.

The broths were as rich and creamy as advertised, and the soft-boiled egg and pork belly were cooked perfectly. My spicy ramen was REALLY spicy, which hit the spot for me but I'd advise against it for the average Joe. <br><br>The cons: everyone raves about the broth and pork and yes, they both lived up to the hype. But the noodles? They were maybe two steps above instant ramen. They didn't have the chewy, hand-rolled density you'd expect from a premium ramen shop. <br><br>But the biggest con that's resulting in these 3 stars is the terrible service we received. We showed up at 1pm for lunch. The place was packed, but we were able to get a seat immediately at the bar. We chose to sit outside instead. BAD IDEA because: flies. Lots and lots of gross black flies hovering over your food, your head, your water. Also: hot, burning midday sun that blistered our skin as we waited FIFTY minutes for a bowl of noodles in broth. I finally went inside to ask about our order, which then magically appeared 2 minutes later. The waitress blamed the long wait on the fact that \"everyone showed up at once\" and \"we can only make so many bowls of ramen at once.\"<br><br>Oh really? Shouldn't those \"so many bowls\" account for the fact that you might, I don't know, have a lunch crowd?? Do you expect customers to wait 50 minutes for their bowl of noodles because the restaurant actually has a lot of other customers? I mean, isn't that the goal of all good restaurants? To have lots and lots of customers (who actually expect to get their food in a reasonable amount of time)?

Sometimes they'll have a vegan tan-tan ramen in their specials, so ask about it. I'm going to stop being bitter about the change in location. I still come here more often than I did before. I love their ramen. The ramen is decently priced for the amount, quality and the stuff you get with it. I recommend any of the miso ramens-- but add aburi kakuni and an extra ajitama (shoyu egg.) The aburi kakuni is perfectly marinated, fatty, delicious, braised/torched pork belly! It's so yummmmmy. As for the ajitama... I'm a huge fan of soft boiled eggs. It's soft boiled egg marinated in soy sauce. The yolk is silky and custardy and not too salty. It is best part of the ramen and I always get extras.<br><br>Besides the ramen, get some of the special sushi slices. I always get the wagyu sushi special. It's perfectly torched and seared, with a bit of garlic and ponzu. Yum. I also love the unagi and brie sushi. It sounds disgusting... and as a sushi purist, I couldn't believe it either. However, the brie adds a new dimension of creaminess to the unagi. It highlights the sweet flavor of the unagi kabayaki sauce that is drizzled over the slice.

You get a big \"meh\" from me.<br><br>I've been getting all this hype. \"You went to Japan? You must be craving ramen. Check out Wasabi. Cocoro? Ramen-san? Check out Wasabi.\"<br><br>I've actually been to Wasabi before. It was back in their old location days. I ended up getting some soba noodles and sushi, all incredibly overpriced, especially for the area. The place was incredibly dark and cramped. We didn't care as my wife, whom I was dating at the time, and I were hungry and wanted to sit. But, I had to come back because of all the hype about the ramen. Well, finally getting a car to come out here helped.<br><br>Let me start out with the wait. If you live in the area, I would see no problem waiting to get a seat. For sure, they have some okay ramen...for the area. I would expect all locals to be swarming the area and waiting in lines. However, I was not a local. I'm from downtown. As I sit in my highrise, I ponder, \"shall I go to Chinatown, where there are a million restaurants that you can choose based off of wait time, or chance this place, where I know this will be one of the only options?\" Reservations? Would be nice for a \"top ramen\" joint. Good thing it was 70F on an April afternoon. I couldn't imagine coming here in February and chancing a seat with an indeterminate wait time. At least downtown, there are other places in which to duck, whereas here you're on the edge of a slowly gentrifying area. Even High Five Ramen, which I haven't been able to check out due to ridiculous wait times, has a waiting area...inside...downtown. My advice? If you want to bill yourself as a top restaurant in this city, throw your business on OpenTable or at least have a waiting area for people to escape from the elements, panhandlers, and riff raff. We sat at the bar to get served immediately.<br><br>Next, allow me to introduce my biased section of the review: I hate onions. The ramen I got was covered with green onions, as was my wife's. I mean, not just sprinkles of tasteless onions. They threw in an entire ladle. I can handle some onions (don't tell my mom), but even my wife, who enjoys them, was picking them out. I know, you're thinking, \"Jared, how could you base a review on a place's ramen just because they put onions in the dish?\" Well, Ramen-san doesn't pollute their ramen and neither does Cocoro. Here comes the retort, \"but, this is authentic ramen and you're just not used to having 10 lbs of onions in your soup because the other places aren't as authentic.\" Yeah, that's a big bunch of BS. Although I may skim the tops of other places, I never had to dig through the bowl to extract onions that were polluted throughout the bowl. Additionally, I have learned how to say in Spanish and Chinese, because of my travels in those speaking regions, that I don't want onions in my dish. In Japan, I never had to resort to Google Translate to figure out how to request no onions and inadvertently call the waitress's mother a whore (I love you, Google Translate, but keep working). Matter of fact, I walk in, look at the pictures, feed the machine yen, and wait for my ramen. Never had an onion problem.<br><br>So, down to brass tacks, how was the food? It was okay. How was the food in regards to paying $40 for 2 bowls of mediocre ramen and driving a 20 minutes to Logan Square? Nope. It wasn't salty to the point of me gasping for water. Well, the best ramen I ever had in Japan was, so there goes that theory. Sorry people.

Once again, the effort to devote to amazing ramen broth is very labor intensive.  A lot of ramen joints will have a big vat that literally just boils day and night.<br><br>Yakitori:  Personally I think chicken breast is a waste.  Thigh is better, but I think there are even better choices than thigh.  Pro-tip: Due to food safety they are required to cook the bird pretty well done.  But the slightest bit of char really overpowers the delicate nuances of the sauce and meat itself.  Ask for them not to overcook it.  I was amazed by the difference.  Went from \"bleh\" to \"the best.\"  Personally, and maybe it's just my peasant blood.  I think the best choice is the chicken skin and the gizzard.  Squirt a little lemon juice on it, it's magnificent; and they happen to be the cheapest cuts.  Win-win.<br><br>Karage (Fried Chicken):  I used to eat this stuff pretty often when I was studying in Japan.  It's the best I've had in Chicago.It kinda gave me one of those Ratatouille-esque memory jolts to my study abroad days.  Their rendition gives it a bit of a modern twist with a nice accompanying mayonnaise.  Definitely nothing like KFC, it's different, but in a very tasty way.<br><br>The quality of sushi has gotten much much better than when I was there last.  Though bear in mind, this is no Arami, Mirai, Katsu etc.  Generally if you want to do sushi right, you have to be a sushi place.  This is not a sushi place.  It's not to say their sushi isn't good, but they don't focus 99% on sushi like those places above do.  Now if you want some amazing life-changing sushi.  Do it properly and spend the appropriate money.  Order only sashimi and nigiri.  Order an omakase and plant yourself at a sushi bar.  Don't use any soy sauce or even wasabi.  Cleanse your palette with the ginger between pieces. Otherwise the sushi here is definitely good for the price point.<br><br>I complained of gummy rice last time, but apparently they swooped in and grabbed an ex-Japonais sushi chef.  I could taste the difference immediately.  They are sourcing some of their fish directly from Japan.  The monk fish foie gras was rich and decadent, like...well duck foie gras.  I hope they aren't force feeding these poor fish too.  Then again monk fish are hella ugly.  I'll definitely have to come back to try omakase sometime.<br><br>Order at least something off the special menu.  Everything is really interesting, and it's a special because it's indeed special.  Not  because they are trying to get rid of some fish that's gonna go bad or something like that.<br><br>The service continues to be polite and attentive.  My drunk idiot friend not only spilled her water, but also broke a glass.  No eye rolls, no stink eyes; they were very gracious and helpful. <br><br>Closest liquor stores: (1) is next to El Cid right across from the Logan Blue Line station.  There's another one right across from the California station (amazing beer selection).  The closest one is gonna be the convenience store connected to the auto shop. Beer selection isn't terrible considering its connected to an autoshop.  And if you don't get lit up enough during your meal (BYOB Policy:  1 bottle per 2 people or 1 6-pack per 2 people)  You can always swing by the Rocking Horse bar next store.  <br><br>This place is probably gonna get super busy just as soon as people realize just how good this restaurant is.  Try this place before the bum rush.  *sigh* i remember when I could get a seat easily at Longman & Eagle.  I miss those days...", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Great ramen and sushi.

Also, they won't take your number and call you when your table is ready - if you're not there when they call your name out, you lose your table.) was already packed. My advice to you, if you don't want to wait, is to arrive BEFORE they open (which is 5pm for dinner most days) - as in, be at the door by 4:45. This was our initial plan, but we were a little late and in my mind I was thinking \"oh, I'm sure 5:15 will still be okay\". Nope. I waited a solid 50 or so minutes despite arriving 15 minutes after they opened. If you don't get there before they open on a weekend, expect an hour wait. And on that note, it's not a good idea to bring a party of any more than 4 or so people, probably 2 if you want to play it safe - there was a party of 8 (?!?) ahead of my party, and they got skipped over at least 10 times because the chance of 8 seats opening up at the same time is basically nil (they have two larger tables, but as you can imagine, larger tables take longer to free up and etc etc...)<br><br>I will say that I think their sign in process is a bit outdated, just in the sense that you walk in and put your name on a list and join the people in the waiting area being shuffled around like cattle every time someone needs to get through the walkway and hope that *eventually* your name is called. No one is there to greet you or give you an estimate of the wait time; the employees in charge of monitoring the list/calling parties in are in and out and unlikely to be accessible. I know they're popular, but I find this system to be a little snobbish. That being said, I generally don't fault a restaurant for having a wait time - if they have a wait time, it probably means they're doing something right.<br><br>On to the important part: the food! My review is 5 stars, so I'm sure you know what's coming at this point. We started with the pork belly buns and the gyoza, along with two of the skewers - the short rib and the pork belly. Pork belly buns are totally the trendy thing for Asian restaurants to serve these days, and my disdain for the trendy is canceled out only by my love of all things pork belly. In other words, I'm completely okay with this since they're freaking delicious. Wasabi's interpretation was no exception - tender yet crispy pork belly, fluffy bao, and a delicious sauce that wasn't too sweet. We enjoyed the gyoza as well - cooked perfectly with a nice pan seared bottom. Finally, the skewers were delicious - nice char on them and great flavor, though they're pricey for the amount of food you get (2-4 dollars for 2-4 bites of meat).<br><br>As for the ramen itself, my boyfriend ordered the spicy roasted garlic miso ramen and I had the tonkotsu. I liken ordering tonkotsu the first time you visit a particular ramen shop to ordering a cosmo the first time you go to a particular bar - it's a classic, and a very good way to gauge how good that establishment is. I lived in Japan for six years, so my standards are pretty high, and I'm happy to report that Wasabi kicked all my standards in the ass, and then some. Our server recommended that we add kakuni to our noodles (which I, admittedly, have never heard of) - from what I gathered, it's marinated and blow-torched pieces of pork belly in addition to what's already included in your ramen. Read: amazing. The fact that it's blow-torched makes it super crisp on the outside, but the inside is still tender and flavorful. Highly recommend getting this. The tonkotsu itself is quite good - I think I've had better broth at other places, but the texture of the noodles really did me in here. Springy and perfect (I don't know how they make their noodles - by machine or by hand - but I'm pretty sure I'd be convinced if you told me it was the latter). I tasted the miso ramen as well, which was nice - I appreciated that the spiciness was actually a flavor, as opposed to just heat, which is an issue I have with a lot of spicy dishes.<br><br>Service while we were dining was great - server was friendly, helpful with suggestions, and just present enough that we didn't have to chase him down, but also not breathing down our necks.

The pork buns were delicious. There were two in an order and it was more like an open faced sandwich. The bread that they used was slightly sweet - the same as what the Chinese restaurants use for peking duck. It worked beautifully with the marinated pork belly meat and green onions that they packed inside! The chicken lollipops came in four pieces and had a side of garlic mayo. The chicken was fried well and the sauce was good but I didn't think it was very impressive - the batter wasn't very unique or especially flavorful.<br>For main courses, we ordered chicken terriyaki and spicy garlic ramen. The chicken terriyaki came with a side of asparagus and a huge serving of sweet potato and of course a bowl of rice. The chicken was grilled skewer style and was a little salty. The sweet potato was relatively bland but went well with the terriyaki sauce. Overall, this dish wasn't a highlight but it was a safe choice. The spicy garlic ramen was a good choice! Albeit a bit salty as well (I was chugging water later that night like a camel), it had really great flavor and the two pork slices were heavenly. For next time, if I didn't order appetizers, I might've ordered extra slices of the Berkshire pork cuz it's THAT good. The egg that also came with the ramen was surprisingly good - the inside of the yolk was milky and very light and delightful!

We started with takoyaki and fried chicken lollipops because they were out of the grilled chicken skin (ugh!). But the chicken we got was good, crispy and juicy and had a nice creamy dipping sauce. The takoyaki was very good, hot, crispy, and melt in your mouth, with delicious sauces and smothered in bonito flakes. Yum. I also LOVED the oyster shooter. Raw oyster, ponzu, quail egg yolk, a pinch of caviar, and a little fizz. It was absolutely delicious when I downed it in one gulp. One of the best little things I've had in quite some time. Now, on to the ramen. We all ordered tonkatsu ramen and added the charred pork belly. The ramen is beautifully presented, and I love the spoons you get with the bamboo handle. The broth is delicious, very rich and flavorful, yet still light enough to eat the whole bowl. (This was one of the flaws I found with Oiistar--the first bite was nirvana, but it was so heavy and rich that I could not finish the bowl. At Wasabi, I drank every last drop of soup.) The noodles were perfectly al dente, egg perfectly soft-boiled. The other fixings like bamboo shoots, green onions, and mushrooms complemented the dish. Both pork bellies were phenomenal and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The Berkshire pork belly that already comes with the ramen was excellent, although one of my two pieces did not have any fat and was a bit on the chewy side. Nonetheless, it tasted amazing. The charred pork belly (kakuni?) was fantastic as well. I got two good pieces. Perhaps it could have been a little more charred, but I still ate it all. Both meats were a little cold. They warmed right up after being in the broth for a while, but the first bite was indeed cold. Like most Asian restaurants, Wasabi suffers in the dessert department. We shared a couple ice cream mochis which could have been a little more thawed out, but I certainly won't dwell on that. Of the ramen restaurants I've been to so far, Wasabi is my favorite, and I can't wait to come back. It is most comparable to Oiistar, but I'd give Wasabi the edge because it's got the \"full package.\" Not only the best tonkatsu, but the best appetizers. Aside from the ramen, the menu is extensive and the few appetizers we tried were very, very good. I can't wait to come back for a bowl of ramen and an assortment of small plates!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uXenj7neEWq-B5g_SSCYoA/348s.jpg", "caption": "Oyster shooter (left) and uni shooter (right)"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FFJwPeEoQ5d_dIIaAh4T1Q/168s.jpg", "caption": "Takoyaki"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rcM2VEd1reQSNP7-8OHZrA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Takoyaki"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Tried to order carryout but there was no answer and the voice mail box was full.  Is this place still open?  I liked the food when I can get it.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Oh, I want this now!

About 10 minutes after ordering, one person in our party got his agedashi tofu & short rib skewer. He waited a while hoping others would get their food, but after 5 minutes the only other thing that made it to the table was my zucchini skewer (tasty, but only 2 coin-sized slices). We encouraged him to eat before everything was stone cold. He did say everything was tasty. He was long-finished with his food when my husband and I got our sushi maybe 15 minutes later. We again tried waiting for the rest of our party to get food, but after a few minutes caved and started on our maki. My husband really enjoyed the meat lover maki & spicy scallop rolls, & I thought the spicy vegan roll was very good.  About 5 minutes after we finished, the other 3 got their ramen. Since I'd had a fairly light meal, I decided to risk ordering another item & hoping it would arrive before the meal's end, but we didn't see our server till she came to clear the (giant) empty ramen bowls much later. After a while she checked back a final time to see if there was anything else we wanted and brought the check.<br><br>In fairness, they did seem to get a few bigger tables at the same time, but at least some effort should have been made to allow our party to eat together. It's awkward for one person to eat while 5 people are still waiting, and the length of time between the arrival of our entrees was crazy. It was literally over 35 minutes between the 1st person getting his food and the last 3 getting theirs. Additionally, I really dislike disappearing servers. We're still your customers after we get our food.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Wasabi is our new favorite ramen spot in Chicago, having gone twice in the last couple weeks since the weather turned. On a cold Chicago winter night, there isn't anything much better than a big bowl of ramen! In the colder months, there tends to be a line out the door on weekend nights, but I can't speak to weeknight or warmer months  as I haven't been during those times yet. This past Friday, we thought we would beat the dinner rush getting there around 6, and there was already a line of people out the door & a full restaurant inside. Not sure what time you need to get there to beat the rush. There is no space to wait inside the restaurant, but they do have a covered area that can fit about 10 people in it- just something to be aware of if it is really cold out. The line seems to move pretty quick, and I am not sure if they take reservations as I have not tried. This is a BYOB restaurant, beer and wine only I believe as I overheard a waitress letting another table know they can't drink the liquor they brought in with them. <br><br>Now onto the food. If I were rating this for the ramen and appetizers alone, I would rate it 5 stars, but the sushi was just average, so giving this 4 stars overall. <br><br>Standouts: <br><br>- Spicy garlic ramen-- AMAZING -- Awesome flavor with just the right amount of spice & garlic<br>- Tonkotsu ramen- This was great also, but I personally prefer the spicy one <br>- Pork belly buns-- also amazing-- meat is so tender & flavorful, and I love the mayo that comes on it <br>- Skewers-- Tried a number of these, but the short rib & meatball were the best <br><br>Just okay: <br>- Crabby Wasabi roll- this was just okay, didn't love the way the soft shell crab was cooked/ tasted<br>- Spicy tuna- I don't know if perhaps we got the wrong roll, but this was very plain & didn't have much spice or flavor to it <br><br>We will definitely continue to go back for the ramen to get us through the brutal Chicago winter.

Their ramen is hands down the best Chicago has to offer no matter what others tell you. The tonkotsu ramen with aburi kakuni is a taste of the heavens. The broth is rich yet balances the flavor with the right amount of oil base. Their pork is super tender and cooked to perfection. Words cannot express how much I love this place. However, ramen preference can be very subjective. Different regions in Japan prepare and cook their soups differently. I'm not a fan of the super oily types such as Ippudo nor the super salty types like Daikokuya or Santoku. Wasabi, in my opinion, does a great job of not making their soup so oily and flavorable that it becomes nauseating after the second sip. <br><br>There are downsides to Wasabi, however. For instance, the consistency of their ramen goes way downhill if you come on a busy night such as Friday night. Their sushi isn't so spectacular either (the nigiri rice falls apart before you even pick it up). I personally like coming to Wasabi during weekend brunch hours since it's not as busy.

The broth tasted really good although it was a little sweet and could have been a lot spicier. The pork belly was pretty fatty and tasted amazing. I wish there was more! I thought the noodles themselves to be one of the best I've had in Chicago. But perhaps my favorite item was the agedashi tofu. I would say 10/10. If you like tofu and you like fried things, please order this. Perhaps it wasn't traditional agedashi tofu that I'm used to but outer shell is deep fried perfectly and is super thick and crunchy. I would go back for the tofu alone. <br><br>They don't take reservations but when you get there you can party information there. They only seat full parties. When my name was called, I told the host that I was still waiting for my friend but my host was nice and gave me a table anyway since it wasn't that crowded on a Monday night. Unfortunately, my waiter was not as nice and he made me feel rushed and guilty. He questioned why I was seated without the other half of my party--as if I had just strolled into the restaurant and sat wherever I pleased. As soon as they took away our main dishes, he asked us if we wanted dessert. We said no because we were so full from our dinner and within seconds, not having moved from our table, he had the check ready for us. Efficient, but rude and presumptuous. I had barely digested my food! Not the way I want to be treated at dinner. I felt like he was just trying to get us out of there so he could make room for the next party. Fortunately for him, there was still a line of hungry diners as my friend and I were leaving. I just hope they get the agedashi tofu if they are waited on by Eric ever again. <br><br>Other useful information: difficult for groups as they only have a few large tables (+6 seats) and don't take reservations.

The pork could have been fattier and more generous.  I mean, I enjoyed it while I ate it, but at the end of the bowl my jonesing for authentic ramen had been mitigated rather than satisfied.<br><br>In the final analysis, I would come back to Wasabi.  The ramen is good enough for a second taste.  Don't get me wrong - eating the ramen was in and of itself a pleasant experience, but I guess my disappointment stems from my comparing it (perhaps unfairly) to that perfect bowl I had in Japantown.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The best ramen in Chicago.  Hands down. <br><br>Great service, great apps.  Tonkotsu and spicy miso ramen are better than anything I've had in San Fran (including Ramen dojo) and NY (ippudo).", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Hands down the best ramen in all of Chicagoland!  Absolutely love this place.

The serving size was perfect.. a nice big bowl.  The broth was the right color and the ingredients all there.  Finally, I tasted it... meh, it was ok.  I really wanted to like it, but the broth left so much to be desired.  The pork had awesome flavor, the noodles where fine.. but the broth, which is supposed to bring the smile to your face, lacked so much flavor.  It was, like I said, fine.  If the restaurant decides they want to make tastier and has a new version, call me up and I'll taste it happily and let you know :)  .  Yes, I admit,  I am a Ramen snob and it may be fine for those who haven't ever tasted true Tonkatsu Ramen.  True Ramen makes you feel all tingly and smiley.  There is something in the broth that brings out all those feelings. <br><br>The sushi, my my, it was not good at all.  The rice was very bland.  I've had better at the local grocery store.<br><br>The gyoza was very good!  I loved it and had a lot of flavor.  And the edamame, well, it's edamame.  <br><br>All in all, for my first experience there, I was not impressed at all.  Just another hipster type joint that is getting great success because everyone jumped on the bandwagon.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Really good ramen.

Wasabi is just not my idea of a good place.<br><br>I am going to keep my comments on the service separately. In terms of the sushi, it is really really overpriced for the portions. I do realize restaurants all have a \"style\" and perhaps this is a style that may work for some but not for me. All I can say is that if wanting to have good portions of raw fish is not considered \"ideal\", then this is not a good place for you. They have paltry amounts of fish and each of their \"fancy\" rolls are all 15.00 or more. And the lesser-priced rolls are just beyond paltry. You're better off buying pre-packaded sushi at Jewel.<br><br>The service, well I was never into the hipster scene and can understand that what some people consider tacky, others might think it's \"welcoming\". As long as you're friendly and attend to my needs I will be OK. However, the service was slow and I really don't think the waitress really was paying attention to what I was asking (of course I had questions). I got the vibe that she was reading a script and was simply \"selling\" me on the rolls she had to sell. There were also a few mixups with the bill as well but that can happen to anyone, I will not take that into consideration when reviewing Wasabi.<br><br>First impressions are everything but even then, Wasabi is not my kind of place. It's such a shame because I live so close to it. At least I still have Sakura!<br><br>I had also forgotten about their \"rules\" for BYOB until someone reminded me recently. The front of their menus have a ridiculous amount of rules. You can only have one six pack per two people and I forget the rest.

The only real complaint that I had was with the service, which was very slow on a less than busy weeknight. When it came to the food however, we were very happy with our choices and how everything tasted. For our appetizer we started with the evening's special pork belly steamed buns and ordered a few small plates to share, which included the grilled chicken gizzard skewer (my bf's choice as they were out of the chicken skin), the fried berkshire pork and brie skewer, and a spicy scallop roll. The steamed pork buns took a while to come out but were worth the wait as the perfectly steamed buns wonderfully absorbed the richness of the pork belly and spicy mayo. I was not a fan of the chicken gizzard skewer as I personally have a dislike towards certain textures, but my bf thought it was well cooked and tasty. The pork and brie fried skewer was a bit disappointing as it was poorly executed and most of the Brie ended up bursting onto our fingers after each bite so it was difficult to appreciate the skewer as a whole. The spicy scallop roll was fresh and had the right amount of scallop and spicy sauce, neither of which overtook the other and blended perfectly into a well prepared sushi roll. For our entrees, we both went with the ramen, my bf having the tonkotsu and me the spicy garlic. Both of our ramen had tender pieces of pork cheek and soft boiled eggs in it, with mine being topped with fried garlic chips, which I thought were an awesome addition and just the right amount of heat in the broth. Overall, our experience at Wasabi was a good one, and for the price it is definitely worth a try.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "great food. got their ramen and sushi.  hands down to the delicious broth of the ramen very savory. i got the spicy one.  but can't go wrong with any of their ramen selection.  plus walking distance from the blue line (logan square)!.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Okay...review a little late since I was at Wasabi with friends several weeks ago! I think about this place so much because I think about..guess what...EATING!! So right away what pops in my head is great food - great ambiance - AND I want to go back!!  This place is awesome; first time visit for my entire party and we all loved it.  The waitstaff was very busy, however attentive!  Every dish that we tried was delightfully good and fresh...Go here and get some...period.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The food here is delicious.  The service, however, is not very good.  Be prepared to wait a long time before being served your food.  Our waiter tried to calm our grumbling stomachs by ensuring us the food would be \"worth the wait,\" but it almost wasn't.  I can forgive delays in the kitchen when a restaurant first opens, and the staff is getting used to the customer ebbs and flows, but this is now the second time I've been at Wasabi and experienced excruciatingly slow food service.  I'm not sure what's going on behind the scenes, but it's time to re-organize.  If you need more wait staff, hire more wait staff.  If you need more help in the kitchen, hire more help!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "one of my favorite places in chicago and possibly my favorite japanese restaurant of all time. great variety on the menu. the yakitori are all fantastic. i couldn't stop smiling after trying the pork. the noodle bowls are comparable to takashi. loved the atmosphere and ambiance. the staff was extremely knowledgable and accommodating and were very diligent with our drinks (byo). the only sore spot was the calamari, but it serves us right for ordering that in a japanese place.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This place has great sushi, is BYOB, and you get a table here on the weekends....what more could you want?  p.s. you must get the artmex if you come here, it is fantastic.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "We really enjoyed the rolls we had at Wasabi.

The first time was really good, unfortunately the second visit left much to be desired. <br><br>The first visit my date and I had the Syou Tonkotsu ramen, Tonkotsu ramen, Edamame, and the Mag Mile maki (we were really hungry!). <br>     The ramen was delicious - broth clear and flavorful, noodles cooked perfectly, all the toppings just really complimented each other. The maki was excellent as well; great quality, good presentation. Edamame was good... but it's hard to make Edamame outstanding (I mean, it's Edamame - really good but still just Edamame).         <br>     The service this visit was pretty good. They brought the Edamame first, gave us a few minutes then brought out the sushi. Then brought out the ramen. We didn't feel rushed nor did they ignore us. The only complaint about the particular visit was that the forgot to bring my date's green tea but did not remove it from the check (we had it fixed when we were paying). If I had written a review after this visit I would have given Wasabi 4 stars. I mean, I really enjoyed my  meal there. I enjoyed it so much that we returned again within a week.<br><br>The second visit left much to be desired unfortunately. For this visit I had the Miso ramen, my date ordered the Teriyaki Entree (rib eye steak, miso soup), I had the Miso ramen, we ordered Edamame again, as well as the Dragon maki. This time around the service was terrible and the food was ok.  <br>     For the food... the Rib-eye Teriyaki left much to be desired all the way around. According to my date, the teriyaki glaze was way too sweet (especially when coupled with the sweet potatoes). Unfortunately, the glaze was a bit runny and way puddles around the entire plate, so everything tasted of teriyaki. The asparagus was chewy and over cooked, the sweet potatoes - meh. The miso soup was alright, but nothing to rave about. <br>     As for me, the Miso ramen left much to be desired. The broth was cloudy with this weird gritty texture, the noodles were overcooked, and in general the whole thing was way too salty (definitely would never order that again). Actually, now that I think of it I'm almost positive I was served the last bowl of a giant ramen batch - not good. The maki was pretty good, nothing to rave about though. And the Edamame was just that, Edamame.  <br>     The service this time around was not so hot. First of all, they brought my date his miso soup but didn't serve any other food. So, he was stuck with either letting his soup go cold or eating without me. Then, after a few minutes, they served the Edamame, maki, ramen, and entree all at once! It was insane. One of the busboys were literally standing by for us to finish eating something so he could remove dishes. Needless to say, I was not pleased. First you don't bring food for the both of us, then you plop everything down at once and expect us to inhale it? I don't think so. Oh, I almost forgot, don't expect a knife if you order the Teriyaki entree, we had to ask for one and got a butter knife (more like a cheese spreader than anything). I found it quite amusing to watch my date try to cut through steak and overcooked asparagus with that knife... probably the most enjoyable part of the meal. <br>     All in all I must say that I will not be going back to Wasabi for a long time, this location needs time to mature and learn how to run efficiently.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "We came on Black Friday and had a similar experience to Steve W. The service was really poor. We were seated and then nobody came back to our table. We got our own menus and then when we were ready to order we flagged down the host. They were apparently very understaffed. They did feel bad about the service and gave us a free dessert. The ramen is great and I think we would have had a good time if the service hadn't been so poor. The ramen is authentic and the pork cheek is a great touch. Probably a fine place to go if you live in the area and they are properly staffed.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I've been in the city for 11 years now and I've tried many sushi resturants.  Sushi Wabi was it for me for a very long time until I found Wasabi.  This new resturant is clean, great atmosphere, excellent food and the service is great.  I have no desire to try anywhere else and it's BYOB which is a huge plus.  I love it so much that I go pretty much every week.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "good portions, very delicious ramen. good selection of appetizers and desserts.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Very slow service, but food more than made up for it.  Really enjoyed all the yakitori options and the ramen was excellent.  Didn't try the sushi, but one of my guests enjoyed the roll she had.  I plan on going back.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "BYOB, good sushi, friendly service, standard prices.
