However, when we said something to the employee, she stated, \"oh yeah, those guys come in here and do this all the time- see, we have a sign up\"- and referred me to a sign with small print on a pillar in the middle of a bunch of tables- hardly the place you would put it if you actually want your customers to be aware. She then went on to say \"we know those two guys, they always do this, but you know we just can't interrupt working all the time to say something\". Seriously?? She then discouraged us from contacting the police (\"they won't do anything\") and when I requested they call them anyway (as the one cell phone we had with us was being used to cancel bank cards) the employees got uncomfortable and look to one another, and I was under the distinct impression an owner or someone had discouraged them from involving the police. They also gave us the run-around about obtaining their camera footage. As an aside, the food was good (but not great) and the atmosphere was nice but crowded.

Adds to the charm, I guess.<br><br>The Cubano gets a lot of love from the local publications, and rightfully so.

The roast pork is slightly too dry, but the ham is juicy and the rest of the sandwich measures up.<br><br>Personally though, my hands down favorite is the ropa vieja. The nicely marinated skirt steak is just the tip of the iceberg, as the addition of very nicely caramelized plantains and and delightful tomato sauce make this sandwich absurdly good. The guava-Q comes in a close second for me, based almost entirely on the strength of its sweet-slightly-spicy barbecue sauce. In fact, all the sauces on the board have been delicious. My wife rotates between the jerk chicken when up for spicy and the pollo arugula when feeling more mellow.<br><br>Finally, I love the addition of a cortadito or cafecito (sans milk), which is a nice afternoon shot in the arm. Like any proper espresso, it should be downed relatively fast, so it's not a with-your-meal drink.<br><br>The lines are never absurdly long here, which is strange because the food is so dang delicious.

The Chicago Swallow has crossed into enemy territory and reports back.<br><br>     First, allow me to allay your fears with a few facts. The Cuban sandwich as we know it today is not at all part of the Red agenda; rather, it was invented in the continental United States by Cuban expatriates bent on leaving that oppressive socialist state. Industrious immigrants married ham, pork, cheese, pickles, and mustard. The marriage is consummated on a bed of Cuban bread. Like the crushing vice of economic oppression, the sandwich is then pressed to give the crust a satisfying crunch.<br><br>     The options available at Cafecito go far beyond the traditional jamon (ha-MON) and queso (KEH-so). A full 20 sandwiches grace the menu as well as a handful of platters, served with rice, beans, and plantains (a delightfully curious, lightly fried banana). With the cheapest sandwich selling for a mere $4.99, the adventurous eater can come back again and again to try them all without so much as a pinch on the pocketbook. <br><br>     Alas, the popularity of the restaurant may be it's greatest enemy. Coming in at noon on a Tuesday felt like queuing for government rations. The Swallow waited patiently half inside and half outside the restaurant. Thankfully, it was on a spring day when one needen't worry about blustery Vortices or Northerlies. A well-dressed comrade working at the restaurant took the patron's orders while in line to expedite the process. But, to change one's order before reaching the register would probably be received with something akin to a firing squad.<br><br>     Finally the sandwich comes. The Chimichurri comes with a choice to make. Chicken, the delicious, squawking bird of Cuba or the most American of meats, the noble steak. The long-time reader knows what this Swallow prefers. Tender, juicy cuts of beef were drizziled with a healthy portion of Chimichurri sauce, an import from Argentina containing parsley, garlic, sunflower oil, and vinegar. How was it? It is this author's opinion that if President Kennedy tasted one of these in 1962, every blue-blooded American would be eating one for lunch followed by a Cohiba as a digestif. 4.5 Swallows.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wRywMS0pQ5wqk7NuVtQT0Q/348s.jpg", "caption": "Chimichurri sandwich with Steak\\r -The Chicago Swallow"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Generally pretty solid in all items on the menu.

Though the flavors were great, I had expected a little bit more of a flavor-punch from the mojo-infused pork, or in the form of some sauce, or maybe just some additional salt/seasoning on the whole thing. Mind you, this is strictly a personal preference, and the flavors were excellent -- I just wish there was a little more of them.<br><br>That said, and as stated above, the pork was nearly perfect. It was fresh, moist, and had a very subtle flavor that coaxed a lot of additional flavors out of the additional components of the sandwich.<br><br>The bread was the star. I nice and crispy, yet tender outer-crust, yet a soft and pillow-y interior locked all of the flavor into a beautifully-pressed capsule of awesomeness.<br><br>Lastly, I also grabbed a Chocolate-Chipotle cookie. I was a big fan of it. It was not very moist, but the real experience was the slow-burn of the chipotle in the back of your throat after you had consumed the cookie. It was really very interesting because you get none of the flavor upfront. It all comes later after you have swallowed (That's what she said?).<br> <br>Food: 4 / 5<br><br>Service: I thought they went above and beyond in terms of service. For how absolutely-nuts and busy this place was, the staff was smiling, talking with customers, and providing an experience that I personally wish was present at every small business restaurant across the world.

I went to get a table and the only unoccupied one had the last patron's trash all over it, so it was up to us to clean up if we wanted a table. Definitely did not add to my dining experience. The patron was at fault for not cleaning up after herself, but Cafecito should really look into hiring extra help, especially on a Friday evening. <br><br>Food: OK<br><br>The cubano was pork, ham, swiss, something else, and mustard. It was really chewy, unpleasantly so. I like my sandwiches to have a 2:1 middle to bread ratio. Instead, it was the other way around, mostly really thick bread. It was just bland and the only flavor came from the mustard. I didn't taste any ham, only pork, and it seemed tough and overcooked. I'm wondering if my sandwich was a fluke because everyone else seems to be a big fan of their sandwiches. Even the cubano at Panera Bread was ten times better than this mustard pork sandwich. My friend ordered the exotic salad, which looked like spinach, shrimp, and avocado. It looked really pretty, but I don't think she was blown away.<br><br>Atmosphere: Excellent<br><br>The only winning point of Cafecito is its ambiance. It has a comfortable, relaxed feel, and isn't too loud or quiet. Next time, I might forgo the sandwich and just get a drink. <br><br>We ended up staying past 9, their closing time.

The regular cafecito itself (espresso with a lil bit of sugar) is also great. <br><br>The first sandwich I had here, I went out on a limb and blindly ordered the jerk sandwich, having never had jerk chicken before or a cuban sandwich, and was instantly love-stricken with a passion for both. The jerk sandwich is excellent, with well portioned red onions, plenty of flavorful and tender chicken, appropriately thin sliced tomatoes and a great sauce all sandwiched between what is now maybe my favorite sandwich bread. This bread is SO good that I order it with butter when I have the black beans and white rice (an excellent vegetarian option). The Cubano is also excellent, very meaty with good tang and is the only sandwich I enjoy having mustard on. I'm confident that if Cafecito only served espresso and their cubano sandwich they'd have near the same level of high business. I've also had the pollo chipotle sandwich, a great combination of fresh ingredients that doesn't taste cuban as much as it just tastes, well, good. <br><br>The service is great as well, cafecito is not a sit down restaurant. It's a walk-up-and-order restaurant that should probably stay that way. The longest I've waiter for anything at cafecito is maybe 7 minutes.

Delivered by the Loop's heavy weight champ of Cuban style sandwiches, Cafectio. <br><br>Located right off Congress, it's accessible for countless folks (students, young professionals, librarians, etc.). Do a couple circles around Wabash and you can find some parking. The interiors small, so if you're looking to sit down try to avoid the lunch rush. <br><br>1:00PM, defiantly rush time. They handle it well. The barista/coffee station gal' asks everyone in line if they want coffee. Get a Cafectio, Cafe Con' Leche, or your favorite poison. They'll add an uppercut of flavor to pair with that roundhouse kick by whipping up some fresh brew. The manager (possibly the owner) asks everyone in line if he can get a sandwich, salad, pastry, or side worked up while you wait for the cashier. <br><br>I'll get my one complaint over with. I simply got the wrong sandwich. I originally ordered the Ropa Vieja and their Valentines Day special sandwich (chorizo, shrimp, arugula, red onion, tomato, and citrus mayo), with a side chopped salad combo. With out  checking my bag (my fault), I walked to the car with a Tilapia sandwich and full chopped salad. When I went back, they quickly addressed the mistake of the wrong sandwich and got me the special, but not the Ropa Vieja. I think there was just some mis-communication, not a big deal. They let me keep the tilapia sandwich, so I didn't bother to bring up the Ropa. Mainly because my car was flashing hazards on Congress.<br><br>DA GRUB: The special was fantastic. Nice plump  tender shrimp, spicy chorizo (not crumbled, the actual cured sausage, bonus points!), plenty of arugula, and just the right amount of that harmonizing citrus mayo. Their bread is perfect, not too thick as to take away from the sammich and not too light to fall apart as you scarf, plus it's got just the right crunch. <br><br>The tilapia, I only took a couple bites and gave the rest to a friend. Sadly, I cant say the same for this sammy as I did for the special. They don't lose points because I never asked for this, just a case of crossing wires during a hectic part of the day. The tilapia was a little dry and the accompaniments didn't exactly make it all better. Again, NBD. <br><br>They've got a nice selection of pastries like churros, croissants, and other goodies. Plenty of fresh sides like hearts of palm salad, potato salad, pasta salad, and more. A great cold drink selection that consists of South American canned juices and sodas. <br><br>Cafectio is fantastic sandwich spot that offers a whole lot more than a Cubano sandwich.

My work is just a block and a half from it, and I make sure to come here at least once a week. I recently found out that I am a Cafecito addict when I caught myself driving to the loop just to have a sandwich on the weekend when I wasn't scheduled to work. Wow, you got me good.<br><br>My personal favorite is the Chivito sandwich. It consists of Ham, Bacon, Steak, Fried Egg, String Fries, Tomatoes, Red Onion, and Cuban Mayo, and the most important ingredient of them all is EXCELLENCE! I could seriously have a Chivoto every day. Other items that I've tried is the Guava-Q and Jerk which I thought were good but didn't live up to the Chivoto which was my love at first sight. Employees here are nothing short of nice and efficient. I see the owner there a lot during lunch time, and he seems like a nice and genuine guy despite his money-making sandwiches. Lunch gets crowded every day, but be informed that the line moves pretty quick, so you won't have to worry about getting back to work late. <br><br>When you're standing in line, please consider trying their Alfajores in their big glass jar. It's a South American cooking whose texture reminds me a bit of shortbread and will definitely crumble in your hand and melt in your mouth. The inside is filled with something that resembles caramel and the sides are coated with coconut flakes. Give it a try, and if you don't like it, feel free to punch me in the box. <br><br>Anyway, before I can't stop rambling about this place, all in all it is AWESOME.

I had the steak chimichurri the first time, and it was so good that I got the chicken chimichurri the second time. Liked the steak better, but both were delicious. The chimichurri was a nice blend of herbal flavors and garlic. It's toasted like a panini. I got some stuff to go, as well -- black bean salad, a mango pastry, Mexican wedding cake cookie (yum!), and sweet Jeebus, an alfajore that was so good it should be a controlled substance. No, really. If you go, you must get one of these. I insist.<br><br>The folks who worked there were very kind and welcoming.

The first time I managed to find a seat, because it was late in the evening and people began clearing out just as I got there. But the second time, I went at lunch, and it was slammed.

This place has been on my radar since this yr's Lolla, but I read \"cafe\" and \"coffee\" and have never had Cuban food before, so I was a bit off-put, despite the awesome reviews b/c Native Cafe also had amazing raves but was pretty disappointing. <br><br>Anyway... pretty empty, 5 other customers there the entire time I ordered & ate. Definitely college-town hippie cafe vibe w/ bare ceilings, chalk menu, TV, & coffee. <br><br>The gal working the register was nice enough. Ordered the POLLO ARUGULA. Waited 5-10 minutes for the sandwich, told her I'll have it here, but got it in a paper bag anyway.<br><br>They also sell pastries and deli-style pre-made salads, which looked really sad & empty at that hour... oh well. It's 7:30pm. The sandwich arrived cut in half, which was appreciated, and IT WAS GOOD. The chicken was very flavorful, bordering over-seasoned, the arugula plenty and fresh, and a bit heavy on the \"citrus\" mayo that didn't taste like citrus at all, but it an all-around GREAT SANDWICH. <br><br>BUT... I would also say that Corner Bakery & Panera serves a great sandwich too. Nicely seasoned, toasted... nothing wrong with it, but nothing earth-shattering either. Would have been nice if the server stopped by while I was eating to follow up since it wasn't busy, but hey, it's a college/hipster hang-out. <br><br>It's worth stopping by for something more interesting & to support a local business, esp. for such a great price ($6-7).

They've also got a great selection of salads and dinner plates if you're looking for something a bit more substantial than a sandwich. I often have to force myself to pass up desert at this place, but if I do decide to treat myself, the tres leches cake is always my first pick. It pairs so well with the coffee. <br><br>The owner has offered coffee on the house several times when he knows I've waited in a long line.

First, the Guava-Q is great on its own, but is especially tasty dipped in hot sauce (I'm partial to a Mexican hot sauce called Valentina), because the sweet and spicy mixes together so perfectly.

The interior is darling for a cafe-type setting, but it's not exactly adequate when you watch a line of at least 50 high school students charging into the hostel next door. This place could probably survive on the hostel's business alone, but then Cafecito had to go and do something crazy - they actually made food that tastes delicious. <br><br>Although I really wanted to try the Chivito (three meats, an egg, cheese, and shoestring potatoes on a sandwich just sounds deliciously evil) I opted for the Jerk Chicken. The bread is delicious, the chicken was tender, and the habanero lime mayo was perfectly spicy. Just the right amount of lettuce, tomato, and red onion was added to my sandwich, and I found myself picking up every last piece of lettuce that fell onto the wrapper and eating it just so that I could prolong the enjoyment of my meal. Lunch buddy had the Palomilla - steak, shoe string potatoes, and grilled onions - and it was also very good. I think that would be an awesome place to go with a friend and order two sandwiches that you both want to try and then split them. We also both had a churro, but they were really nothing special (could have been better if actually warm).<br><br>Even though I really want to go back and try other sandwiches, the sign advertising plated dishes intrigued me even more. This place offers comforting cuban food in a really accessible coffee-house type venue. I can't wait to go back and try a plated dish (and maybe get a Chivito to go!) because I'm sure another visit, so long as it is as good as this past experience and so long as I don't have to deal with 50 patrons of the hostel beating me in line to order, will turn review into a 5 star experience.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Favorite lunch place in the loop.

Once you step right in you can just order and they bring the food to you. <br><br>I had the Chivito - the meatest sandwich of the bunch. It was awesome, especially with that citrus mayo. Another sauce that I could get out of my mind! The bread was very crispy and thin.. so thin that the inner goodness was squirting out all over the place. I had to doing a 360' bite all around to keep it from bustin' out! <br>Definitely worth another trip here again and try the other sandwiches. Bye Mcdonalds.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I was there today to get a to-go lunch sandwich. I got the Jardin pressed sandwich which includes eggplant, mushrooms, roasted peppers, mozarella, arugula and jalapeno hummus. It was really good! It was spicy but not overwhelmingly and the mushrooms were delicious. It was one of the few really good pressed sandwiches that I've had thus far. I wish it was a little cheaper though. <br><br>I had to wait about 7 minutes for my sandwich to get prepared which was a little long but there was only one person making it. It's good to know that it's made fresh too though. The place advertises to have free wi-fi however there it is password protected, so I couldn't even access it while I was there. I don't understand why places that advertise to have free wifi have it under a password. Isn't it supposed to be free - accessible? No idea. The place is small and looks pretty cozy. Not too sure about the staff, they seemed nice one minute and annoyed the next. It was hard to tell what their true attitudes were.<br><br>4 stars because the sandwich was delicious.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Incredible Latin food. Great food.

I ordered a chipotle chicken basil sandwich, and while the sandwich was good at first, as I started to really get into it, it was a little dry, and something was off about the flavor. (Still ate it though). I also ordered plantains and black beans and rice. I was really excited about those 2 items b/c they define cuban food to me - homey and delicious. Well, both of these items missed the mark for me. The plantains tasted soggy, like they were cooked a few hours before and they were sitting under a heat lamp. I don't know how they prepared them, but I wasn't feeling it. As far as the beans and rice, I got about 20% beans, and 80% rice - I was like, dang - can I get some beans with that rice?? <br><br>The place is a cool spot to chill if you have work to do. They play latin music and there is WiFi. I would probably go back to try another sandwich or to chill out, but I'm going to steer clear of the side items and get a bag of chips next time.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Went to lunch with a friend on a Thursday @ 11:30. I ordered the Chivito (Steak, Ham, Bacon, Fried Egg, Mozzarella, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Shoestring Potatoes, Citrus Mayo) and she ordered the Ropa Vieja (Slow roasted Skirt Steak, Sweet Plantains, Black Beans, Tomato Creole Sauce). We had half of each sandwich. I was a fan of the Chivito. The flavors went well together and the sandwich was not too soggy or too dry. The Ropa Vieja had great flavor too but I preferred the Chivto. It wasn't too busy and the sandwiches came out after a 7 minute wait. Printed off a coupon for a complimentary side salad when you purchase 2 sandwiches. We chose the hearts of palm. It was light and tasty.

The Guava Q sandwich is so great that I definitely wanted to let the Yelp world. I had it with pork, which was roasted and had great flavor. The caramelized onions were a great addition but the winner is the Guava BBQ sauce. I don't know what it is or how it's made, but It's super. The bread was also a highlight. Lately, I feel like sandwiches are all bread. The bread was also great but it wasn't the main attraction. They know it's purpose is to hold the meat together. Great flavor without being filler.<br><br>At under $6, it's a bargain.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Mmmm, Cafecito! Where do I even begin? I thought I would give Cafecito a shot since I am interning in the hostel adjacent to it this summer, assuming it would be your typical run-of-the-mill, convenient cafe. Boy, was I in for a tasty surprise!<br><br>First of all, the Cafe Con Leche is absolute perfection. I have developed a habit of getting a large size of this tasty coffee treat a few times each week before work. I usually am not a fan of sweeter coffee drinks, typically preferring my coffee black, but after taking the suggestion of a friend to give it a try, I am sold! It is incredibly reasonably priced for a coffee, and has a smooth, creamy taste that isn't too sweet or harsh in the morning time. <br><br>My only complaint (and it is so tiny that I almost feel I shouldn't mention it, but in the spirit of full disclosure...) is regarding the desserts and pastries. For me, they have been hit or miss. I really enjoyed the \"Mexican Wedding Cookies\" (my mom makes them and calls them Snowball cookies, so I may be partial to this taste of home); you get a box of about 10 or so for $5 and the manager told me that his mom makes them. They aren't always available, but if you see them by the register, give them a try! However, I tried a Coconut Dulce de Leche pastry the other day, and to be honest, it didn't do it for me. The crust was chewy, not crunchy, and the taste was bland. This is a small issue compared to the rest of the amazing menu, however. I will continue to try different pastries and see what hits the spot!<br><br>Now, onto the mother of all bites to eat, the pressed sandwiches. I have absolutely no words to properly describe how in love I am with these sandwiches. So far, I have tried the Cubano, Palomilla, Pollo Arugula, and the Margarita, and I plan on trying many more. The Cubano was rated the #1 Cuban sandwich in Chicago, and for good reason. The Pollo Arugula stands out to me, due to its delicious citrus mayo and healthy amount of arugula (which I love). What makes these sandwiches the best is the bread. It is crispy, crunchy, soft in the middle, and flavorful. The sandwiches are ready quickly, and are astonishingly inexpensive for the value. I mean, you could order a sandwich at Subway for the same price. I am dreading the day that Cafecito's manager wakes up and realizes how outstanding his sandwiches really are, and jacks up the prices. (I would still buy them.)<br><br>Well, my long-winded rant is over.

Disappointingly, however, Cafecito is only three stars for me. I base these stars on wait time, accuracy of orders,  quality of food, and the staff members. <br><br>I docked a couple of stars because the wait was quite long. I came in half past noon and the line was piling up. Luckily, I crammed my way into the front of the line and even avoided dirty looks from others! I waited about 5 minutes, gave my order, and then waited for about 15 minutes. I don't think the wait should have been so long considering I had one of the bigger orders at the moment (I peeped what was going out to people) with only two sandwiches and a soup. I also docked some points due to the fact that somewhere between the cash register and delivery counter, I got the wrong sandwich in my bag. I didn't even think to check before leaving as I was in a rush to get back to work. When I sat down at my desk super excited to try my jerked chicken sandwich, I saw that I had a Tilapia sandwich instead. Considering the fact that I put quite some thought and time into choosing my two sandwiches, I was really annoyed. I mean, I still ate it, but yea, I was totally annoyed. <br><br>The only thing that brought my mood back was that the Tilapia was really very good. It wasn't plain like some fish sandwiches often tend to be, and I just loved how much lime or lemon flavor there was that I tasted. I can also say that the Ropa Vieja was delicious with the combination of meat, sauce, and the perfect plantains. The black bean soup didn't disappoint either. <br><br>A few other positives about Cafecito are that the prices are reasonable, the employees are all really friendly, and the bald guy behind the counter running things is a kind of a hottie. <br><br>I guess three stars is a bit harsh considering they have good food that is undeniably Cuban and the vibe is casual and friendly, but I don't think I can bring myself to give it four stars when the wait is so long and I'm not even getting the items I ordered.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I absolutely love this place!

I am hispanic myself and am more than well-acquainted with rice and beans and other latin fare and am not easily impressed with offerings from restaurants - even the five-star places - that are out there in Chicagoland. But Cafecito has not only won over me completely but has made my family - even more picky than myself - into huge fans. My mother, whom formerly managed a restaurant and is an excellent cook herself, loves the Cubano and several other sandwiches and is a Hearts of Palm Salad fan too. <br><br>The sandwiches feature flavorful meats and trimmings on perfectly toasted Gonella bread. I pretty much love all of the two dozen or so sandwiches they serve - they are better than any fast food fare downtown and shame nearly any of the myriad other Loop sandwich makers as well. And you get all of this at quite reasonable prices. The salads are equally fresh and feature ingredients that you don't often find in the average restaurant salads served in this country. My favorite are the Chopped Salad and yes, the Hearts of Palm salad, but you'll undoubtedly find other as well to your liking - they are all good. The flavorful and zesty rubs and sauces that are in the sandwiches take already good ingredients and make them that much better tasting. <br><br>Service is reasonably fast given the large crowds and long lines that form at the location with which I am familiar (located by the Chicago Hostel entrance on Congress Parkway.) But if you are getting carry-out as I usually do, you might want to check your order before you leave the register as I have run into some issues with forgotten items. (Not to excuse this on their part but they are very, very busy almost all the time and are rushing to serve everyone as fast as they can so forgetting an item here or there is probably inevitable. So just check the bag quick to make sure you are getting the right amount and type of items.)<br><br>The only other caveat to eating here is for those whom are sensitive to spicy food should be wary of the Jerk sandwich and the Black Bean Soup is definitely not for the shy of spice! The Beans and Rice can also be a bit much for those whom have a tender stomach. I am okay with the \"heat\" level myself but fair warning to those whom are spice-intolerant!<br><br>I have not had breakfast here yet but I intend to rectify this oversight soon!

It still tastes good, so I don't complain.<br><br>The one qualm, if you could even call it such, is the place gets PACKED around lunch time during the school year because it's right near Columbia College and it connects with the hostel.  So I usually go early or late and it's all good.  Go.  It's great.  Support a locally owned business and protest the overpriced and/or fast food in that neighborhood.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Best sandwich ever.

My boyfriend and I planned to eat at Cafecito before heading to Lollapalooza aroud 5 pm on Saturday. As all Chicagoans now know, a massive storm hit around 4:30 pm, causing Lollapalooza to be shut down for a few hours. Due to its proximity to Grant Park, Cafecito quickly filled up with frustrated, wet, tired Lolla-goers. The employees at Cafecito handled the crowd BEAUTIFULLY. They provided extra chairs for people to create their own dining area since all of their tables were occupied by those of us that got there before the storm hit. It was such a comfortable environment to be in, which was quite the contrast to the dark, stormy streets outside. There was salsa music on in the background and the Olympics were being broadcasted on the restaurant's TV, so we sat back, enjoyed our incredible food (I'll get to that in a minute), and waited out the storm before making our way back to Lollapalooza- once it re-opened, that is.<br><br>So, the food. I ordered the Pollo Arugula sandwich, my vegetarian boyfriend ordered the Jardin, and we split the Black Bean Soup. HOLY CRAP. My sandwich was incredibly delicious. The chicken was the BEST I have ever eaten in my life. It was perfectly marinated and juicy (their menu says they marinate all of their meats in their Cuban mojo sauce) and was perfectly complimented by a generous helping of arugula, fresh tomatoes, and red onion. Not to mention, the sandwich had a perfect amount of their homemade citrus mayo, which I would eat with a spoon, no matter how disgusting that sounds. It was all surrounded by their bread, which was like nothing I've ever had. It was almost like a thinner, less chewy foccacia. They press the sandwiches while they cook so that the bread gets crispy on the outside and holds everything inside wonderfully. Seriously, I cannot stop raving about that sandwich.<br><br>My boyfriend's sandwich had mushrooms on it, which I am not a fan of, so I didn't try his. However, he said it was amazing. It had red peppers on it, which he normally hates, but he left them on the sandwich because they added really nice sweetness that complimented the eggplant, and he didn't even mind their texture, which is normally why he won't eat them.<br><br>The black bean soup was magical. I consider myself a black bean soup aficionado- it's always been one of my favorite foods as it's so easy to make and so damn delicious. Cafecito's black bean soup is the best by far that I have ever eaten. It didn't have that gummy texture that some bean soups tend to have, no- this soup had a lovely, lightly spicy broth with WHOLE black beans. None of that mushed garbage that you get at most restaurants. It was so warm and delicious and wonderful on that rainy evening, we were both sad when it was gone! And if it wasn't great enough on its own, it's served with a side of their bread that I raved about earlier. <br><br>The storm was still raging on after we finished our meal, so I saved our table while my boyfriend got back in line to order some dessert while we waited. The line was winding out the door, but it didn't take him more than 5 minutes to come back with a Dulce de Leche pastry and a slice of Key Lime pie. (I didn't mention this earlier, but when busy, Cafecito takes orders Portillo's-style, which speeds up the ordering process immensely). I tried a bite of the Dulce de Leche pastry, and it was great. Flaky dough surrounding creamy, dense, slightly chewy caramel center. Seriously good stuff. The Key Lime pie was my favorite though. I had to slow myself down from eating it because I wanted to prolong the magical experience. It was perfectly tart, and the lime flavor came through strongly. The sour was balanced by creamy sweetness, and everything was held together by the perfect amount of graham cracker crust. I never wanted that slice of pie to end.<br><br>Well, clearly I am a fan of this restaurant. As long as I am within 1.5 miles of Cafecito, I will walk there.

The Cuban was excellent but the Chuvito I have to say, was thee best sandwich I have ever had. It was a food orgasm. It consisted of steak, ham, bacon, lettuce, tomato, shoestring potatoes, fried egg, mozzarella cheese and finished off with a citrus mayo and put together by freshly baked and pressed Cuban bread. They have at least 10-12 other sandwiches I have yet to try but passing up on this one is gonna be tough. After experiencing total bliss, we then had cafe con leche and guayaba (guava) danishes and all I gotta say is...serious? The coffee was some of the best I've ever had. Phillip makes this homemade sticky sugar mixture that he uses and then the danishes...amazing!!! We've been going every weekend since finding this gem of a restaurants. Oh, and did I mention a sandwich, drink, coffee & dessert only came to $10-12 per person? You don't have to be a fan of Cuban sandwiches to fall in love with this place.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "a pleasant suprise in the desolate area south of van buren in the loop.  i've been here a few times with coworkers and all the sandwiches, sides salads, and plantain chips have been very tasty and reasonably priced for lunch in the loop.<br><br>favorites are the jerk, cubano, and the pollo somethingorother.<br><br>we'll keep going back to cafecito for sure!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This place might have best Cubano in Chicago. It's just the right size and the proportions of each ingredient are perfect, not greasy or overwhelming. I recommend it with plantain chips and the Cafe con Leche, which is also as good as any other in the city. I've had some other sandwiches (Lechon, Guava Q, others I can't remember) too, which were also good. The Jerk Chicken sandwich was a little blander than I had hoped, but that's kind of a first-world complaint, isn't it?", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Fantastic food for a fantastic price.  One of the best lunch spots downtown!  Try the Cubano.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Favorite lunch spot in the loop! Great food and awesome service. I have never had a sandwich I didn't like, the chimichurri and jerk are excellent! It is very small and popular so you will probably find a line out the door but don't let that stop you, they move fast and I promise the food is worth the wait. The black bean and corn salad is very tasty and a great alternative to chips.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Right out of the box Cafecito excels at what they do. It's a great looking place with right sized sandwiches that taste fresh and original. I had the chimichurri chicken and loved it. As a compliment I also tried the small (salads come in 3 sizes) Caprese that had fresh mozzerella, tomato and basil dressed with balsamic vinegar - excellent. With a large soda the sandwich and salad were still under $10. Maybe next time I'll have dessert instead of salad!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The location took me by surprise, in that I didn't know it was there, but after realizing it neighbored the South Loop hostel, it made a bit more sense. Still considering the great sandwich options and how perfect the Cafe Con Leche was, you'd think there would be blaring neon lights beckoning customers. And yes, they do accept credit cards.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I don't know how they fit so much flavor in these little sandwiches. They were so good, and actually pretty cheap. I would love to come back and try everything on the menu. And the Tres Leches desert is a total winner. As Andrea mentioned, the service was a little awkward, as I was standing at the counter for a couple minutes as the girl was preparing the previous person's order without even looking at me or saying Hi. Anyway, that wasn't enough to prevent a 5 star review, so oh well.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Excellent sandwiches, but I can't seem to pronounce anything on the menu other than the cubano(which is so fricken good I don't care). This seems unimportant and trivial, but the way they wrap the sandwich in paper makes it seem extra special.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Best Cuban Sandwich that I have discovered in Chi Town. Good Coffee. The Cafe Con Leche is great. Very Good Batidos- Try the Guanabana. If you dont know what a batido is you need to find out here. The place is hidden between a DQ and a Hostel but once inside there is good music and very good food. Dont forget to order the Arroz con Fijoles Negros on the side.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "so much better and cheaper than xoco (what's their deal with their gum scrapingly hard bread).  the cubano at cafecito never fails to impress!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I love this place! The food is amazing and the environment is warm and welcoming. My favorite drink is their refreshing iced latte with caramelized sugar. My favorite food their is is the steak \"palomilla\" sandwich. Worth the visit!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Cafecito did a great job catering an office lunch for 65 people with a variety of sandwiches, salads, and the mango mousse.  Everyone really enjoyed all the food.  Philip, the owner, was wonderful to work with in arranging everything.  I will definitely keep Cafecito on the short list of preferred vendors.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "All I've ever really eaten here is the chivito...which is a damn good sandwich. Until I try something else...4 stars good for now", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "One of my favorites in the area. The cafe con leche is always delicious, and last time I had the tilapia grilled sandwich, which was amazing. They're really friendly too!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Very good sandwiches, you can't really go wrong with any, I've tried like 5 now.    The hummus is AMAZING, not your average hummus.   Not a huge selection of sandwiches, but if you stick with a sandwich and side of hummus you'll be happy with your order.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Nice Loop place. I'll give them an extra star just for being a comfortable place to get an unassuming sandwich and a latte downtown. The food doesn't live up to the hype it's been getting (these people need to get to Miami, for god's sake), but the Cuban style sandwiches are tasty. Good choice for an afternoon hideaway.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Those sandwiches and pastries are to die for!  Yummy goodness, friendly staff and great music and decor.  I can't get enough of the cuban, the jerk chicken and the palomilla!  Philip and staff deliver the goods.  So get on down there for some great grilled sandwiches, a oozing guava pastry or the celebratory Mexican Wedding.<br><br>Just outstanding", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Oh my goodness. This place rules. I had this saved in the back of my mind to try someday when I was in the area, and I am so glad I remembered it and went. I got the cubano and the cafe con leche, and it's a toss-up as to which was more perfect. The two together are ridiculously good.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "It's the best Cuban sandwich I've ever had (and yes, I've been to Miami). The roast pork really makes it, although the high garlic factor makes it unsuitable for pre-date eating. The coffee (a cortadito in my case, kind of a Cuban macchiatto) is bracing but smooth. I am already plotting my return so I can work my way through the rest of the menu.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Cafecito has delicous pressed sandwiches, excellent rocket-powered Cuban coffee, and great service. Probably the best lunch deal in the loop. The Cubano beats any of the others I've tried in Chicago, and I have several other favorites as well - the lechon, the pollo arugula, the lechon, the choripan, the lechon, etc.  I asked the owner where I could find the marinade he uses on his pork, and he told me I couldn't... because he makes it from scratch. Are you kidding? This is a gourmet restaurant disguised as a quick lunch spot, and the disguise goes right down to the prices. If you walk past this place to go to Panera, you should be thrown in the mental clink.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Fantastic coffee and sandwiches, what more could you ask for? need to check out the breakfast options one of these days.  I order the viejo ropa plate today and was not disappointment, the plantains were sooooo good!  love this place, definitely my go to spot being a columbia student.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Best coffee in the South Loop. Generous portions and friendly staff. Never been disappointed. the breakfast sandwiches are amazing they take a few min but well worth it.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "amazing everything! really good sandwiches, especially liked the guava-Q. my friend got a guava banana shake and it was pure heaven. service was impeccable for a cafe style place. mmm.. i'm thinking about going back very soon.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "yep, this place is gold. Haven't had a bad sandwich yet, the coffee is as good as they say it is, and they've got great cuban milkshakes in the summer too. And the owner, everyone who works there is friendly .", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The South Loop keeps getting better and better - Cafecito is a fantastic little spot if you're in the area. The black bean salad and potato salad were great starters while we were waiting for our sandwiches. I had the Cubano (because almost every Yelper recommended) and it was pretty good. My friend had the Jardin which had lots of veggies and cheese. The furniture was comfortable...but the space is pretty small.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I recently moved to Chicago from Miami and one of the first things I wanted to do was find a good Cuban restaurant. I was disappointed that Cafecito didn't have croquetas, a staple at any Cuban restaurant. I ordered the Lechon and my girlfriend ordered the Cubano, our two favorite Cuban sandwiches. The sandwiches were different than ones we've had in the past but they were delicious. The food is more Cuban inspired than traditional Cuban food. Either way the sandwiches are very tasteful and inexpensive. I'll be sure to go back and try their other sandwiches.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "So a friend of mine recommended this place to me the other day. As a Depaul student in the Loop, there are limited options so I try to find new places to quench my palate. This Cuban cafe is  tucked just off of Wabash, right across from Columbia College. They have an array of sandwiches (their specialty) but also offer soups and different deli salads. I love pork and nothing screams pork like a Cuban restaurant. After much debating I settled for the Guava-Q. A monstrosity of roasted pork, jicama slaw, carmelized onions, and guava barbeque sauce. My friend went with the Palomilla (Steak, grilled onions, tomato, lettuce, shoestring potatoes). I got the combo which for a 1.49 more gets you chips and a drink. They have plantain chips which you can get for a quarter more, which I highly recommend.  The sandwich in itself is not bad, but it also wasn't very good. The pork was tender and had a good flavor. The BBQ sauce was tangy and delicious, but definitely messy to eat. I was not impressed by the \"jicama slaw\". All it seemed is that they took some jicama and diced it up and put chunks on the sandwich. I was expecting more of a coleslaw shape not chunks. If they julienned the jicama and then tossed in their sauce it would be a lot better. The carmelized onions went unnoticed. It's a nice place in the Loop, and I will go back because I want to try the Chivito or heart attack (Steak, Ham, Bacon, Fried Egg, Mozzarella, lettuce, tomato, onion, shoestring potatos, citrus mayo).", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Anyone in Chicago or visiting who loves a Cuban sandwich or has wanted to try one. This is a great place to find one. The prices are reasonable, which is great considering you are downtown. They also have good coffe drinks. I recently had their cafe con leche (coffee and milk) and it reminded me of the time I was on South Beach and had the same drink at a Mom & Pop restaurant there. So if  you are in the loop and want to taste a bit of the tropics stop by here.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Delicioso! Best cuban sandwich I've had since my days in Miami.

GREAT vibe!  I heart cafecito's", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "went with a few friends so i got at least a bite of four diff sandwiches.  the chivito was the most flavorful - all sorts of flavors going on.  the fried egg took it to the next level.  the cubano was good.  pretty standard i think.  the chimichurri sauce made that sandwich interesting in adding an herbal flavor to it and the ropa vieja was tasty.  kinda reminded me of a stew put in a sandwich with the juices and the beans.  <br>the milkshake was great in a unique way.  got the mamey, which i had never had before.  the fruit was described as pumpkin, maraschino cherries and sweet potato, which described it to a t.  yum.  all in all, a really satisfying meal.  plus, the owner was really nice, which is a definite bonus", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "yumyumyum. good quick, cheap bite to eat. i got the cubano and was not disappointed. also had a side of the potato salad (not spectacular, but not bad). the owner was super nice and helpful in giving recommendations", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "One of the very best lunch spots in the South Loop area. Service is great even when they have a line out the door...which is pretty much every weekday at lunch time.

Both sandwiches were amazing. The place was relatively busy for a Tuesday night and considering the location. I highly recommend the cuban sandwich. The bread was perfectly crispy and flaky and every bite had the perfect combination of meat, cheese, sauce, and pickles. Best cuban sandwich I have ever had. Service was also really good, but I would go here even if the service sucked, the food is that good.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Holy monkeys if this isn't one of the best value sandwiches around. Hidden away in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it spot on Congress Pkwy, the often-recommended Chivito sandwich really is as good as it sounds. It's filling without being overpowering. I usually just take-out here at lunchtime as it's pretty busy, with an interesting mix of students from the nearby colleges, clued-up workers who know about this place, and folks probably staying at the hostel. Can take a while for your sandwich to be ready, but it's usually worth it. I've heard good things about their hot chocolate too.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Thank you yelp. Visiting from out of town and looking for good cheap food and found it. $5 cubano was delicious.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I had the cafe con leche, alfajores, and cubano sandwich.  The all of the meat in the sandwich was tender, but it didn't wow me (still very good).  What was amazing was the coffee.  Sugary, warm, and with an alfajor was very satisfying.  Cafecito is definitely worth a try.  The owner is nice and makes an effort to get to know his customers to make sure that they are happy.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "i first visited when this place had only been open about a week. the owner came and chatted with us, super nice guy, and is always around. the cuban sandwich and that cafe con leche are totally incredible. i also like jalapeno hummus. this place is awesome. worth every cent!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Great food, friendly staff.  Love their Atun (tuna) sandwiches, the steak and chicken chimichurri.  Could eat gallons of the hearts of palm salad.  Everything is well seasoned, if a little on the oily side (but in a really good way).  When I spent lots of time in this neighborhood, I would go once a week. I'll have to start making excuses to drop in again.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "As has been said many times, the Cubano sandwich - totally, totally awesome.  However, the eggplant side salad was a major disappointment.  They need to salt the eggplant first or something because it was bitter and didn't have the creamy texture I was hoping for.  The other side dishes looked good, I'll have to try the bean salad next time.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "My lunchtime companions and I dined at Cafecito today.  Very nice decor and 'eye candy' from all of the institutions of 'higher learning' located nearby.  Always a plus.  Impressed with the service especially given the 'newness' of the place.  Ordered Jerk chicken sandwich with a side of the potato salad.  Salad served at time of order.  Sandwich came a bit later.  Nice solid sandwich but a bit lacking in heat.  Always want heat with anything advertised as Jerk.  Blackened might be a better description.  No complaint.  It was tasty and excellent bread!  Will go for the straight-up Cubano next trip south.  Salad was a nice surprise.  Oil with rosemary (I think) and capers.  Was able to get a refill on my pop with a smile from the counter person.  Try that at other places and sneer will accompany your request.  Would be a great place for coffee and a pastry (see couch and chair mentioned elsewhere).  A little spendy for lunch but this is the Loop.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I have been a fan of Cuban sandwiches ever since my coworker introduced me to Cafe Marianao.
