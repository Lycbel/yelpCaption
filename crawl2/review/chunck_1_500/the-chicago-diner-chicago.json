We decided to share those and a Portabello Truffle Melt, family style. For sides we picked vegan Mac n Cheese, Sweet Potato Fries, and Yucca Chips. Each dish was seasoned to perfection! The Radical Reuben was by far my favorite, and one of the most memorable sandwiches I've had.

On this very short trip, I managed to make it to CD twice!<br><br>My first visit was at dinnertime, but I wasn't very hungry. That gave me a good excuse to \"just get the nachos\" lol. OMG. Seriously. OMG. Good vegan nacho cheese is a hard thing to find - and they've figured out how to make the best of it. I believe they use Teese cheeze for theirs, which is hard to come by in Phoenix. It has the ooie gooiness that you need in nacho sauce and doesn't turn into plastic like some do when they cool. The nachos are served with items - vegan chorizo, black beans, etc. but who cares when the cheese is that good? I enjoyed all of it. But even with \"just nachos,\" I was too full for desert. I did have one of their delicious Blue Sky organic ginger ales though - hoping that would open my stomach up to more capacity, but no luck.<br><br>My friend had the truffle mushroom lentil loaf. I'm not a fan of mushrooms, but I took a bite off the corner and it was delicious! It was a thick, crispy slab of meatless loaf. The roasted and sauteed veggies on the side were good, but the potatoes were a little over seasoned.<br><br>I managed to get there for brunch for the second visit. No one does vegan breakfast/brunch better than CD. I had the Mickey Muffin - an English muffin with sausage, tofu and gravy, and had Daiya cheddar cheese added. The vegan sausage was the best I've ever had! The gravy overpowered it a bit (made it a hot mess), but it was delicious. I ordered the potato hash extra crispy and was delivered a half a plate full of bite size potato flavor crunch. Over-the-top outstanding!<br><br>One of my companions got the Country Benedict and gobbled it up. I forgot to grab a sample! Another went for the Tofu Marsala. He loved the mushroom sauce. The tofu was nice and crisp on the outside. We didn't care for the veggies that came with it though - maybe too much garlic?<br><br>Once again I was stuffed, but we got a piece of the cocoa mousse cake to go. By the time we got home in the Chicago heat the \"mousse\" part had melted away (duh), but the cake was fine!<br><br>Service was great both times. My Thursday night visit was wait-free, but we did need to wait out front in the heat for about 15 minutes for the Saturday brunch visit.

My friend has Celiacs disease and therefore she can't eat anything with gluten and she's a vegetarian. My friend had just arrived from NYC and she was starving so why not try The Chicago Diner? It was super busy but my friend decided to wait It out because she liked the menu. The hostess did an absolutely amazing job keeping everyone posted on the wait times. The Chicago Diner is not that big but they have a closed off patio in the back. To avoid commotion in front of the restaurant, the hostess encouraged people waiting to be called to proceed to the patio area where there were heating lamps and chairs for customers waiting to be called. It was so nice of them to accommodate their customers in such a way. There was a family of four that had been waiting for a while and the hostess came by frequently and let them know, \"hey we're working on it- we're waiting for one table to clear out.\" I know the customers appreciated it. <br><br>We finally got seated and to be perfectly frank, this is not a place to go to for a romantic date or a first date. This is a place you can go with friends or on a chill night out with your significant other. Hipster crowd for the most part but this place also accommodates larger parties (families). It is so busy with people walking by with food or squeezing between each other that if you're sitting in between the two rows needed to move between the front of the restaurant and the kitchen, you'll constantly feel like someone is bumping against you. We had a really tall waiter with curly brown hair- he was super nice but he was also super tall and could barely hear us as we ordered our food. I kid you not- poor guy came back three times to be like \"I'm sorry, what was it that you ordered with this again?\"- I just started laughing and said to him, \"I'm sure it's hard to hear from all the way up there\". Anyways, I was at a wedding taste testing earlier in the day and so I wasn't hungry and ordered the mint chocolate chip shake. I have to say- I was disappointed! Okay keep in mind this was my first vegan experience so as far as anything vegan dairy is concerned, I had no expectations and I had no idea what was coming my way but I learned quickly, it ain't no Philadelphia though! You're charging me $7 for a regular milkshake which is btw more like a small milkshake. It wasn't nearly enough milkshake for $7 worth especially when you see how quickly it goes from ice cream to I scream because it turned into milk. It also tasted more like milk and chocolate chips than an actual shake. I was told I got the wrong shake, that the best shake is the peanut butter and chocolate chip- well, it's too late now! My friend got a gluten free burger that contained sweet potato and i don't know what else but she said it was delicious. My friend also got Brussels sprouts which seemed to be marinated with vinegar. That too was super delicious as well. For dessert, my friend wanted to try the cheesecake of the day- key lime cheesecake but the waiter said that it was out and they had no more so she just ordered a scoop of ice cream with chocolate syrup on top. The ice cream tasted weird- it needed some coconut milk in its life. The ice cream was bland and the texture was slightly off- I'm also comparing my observation to the dairy I eat so naturally it's not on the same level playing field. Well, while I went to the bathroom, my friend looked over to the desserts and noticed there was a cheesecake and it looks like 3 slices had already been cut. She confronted the waiter who said after I brought you the ice cream, I was informed that we do have cheesecake and he then said he would knock out the price of the ice cream and just charge us for the cheesecake... even though the only reason we chose the ice cream was because he failed to look into whether or not there is cheesecake.

None the less, here's my review of The Chicago Diner.<br><br>As you all know by now, my Fiancée is vegan. I don't mind it, it gives me a reason to try new places and new foods and that's one of my favorite things in the world to do. Chicago Diner is one of those places. Menu is very extensive with options from all over the world. There are gyros, buffalo chicken, country fried steak, all available in vegan options! There are so many vegan things on the menu, you'd do better asking what isn't vegan! I had the Country Fried Steak, she had Buffalo Chicken and a Gyro, her mom had a Rueben. It was all vegan, and all absolutely fantastic! Country Fried Steak was nice and crispy and the portion was huge. Buffalo Chicken was most certainly the star here though! Great buffalo flavor, fantastic crisp on the \"meat\" and a side of vegan ranch sauce was the perfect partner in crime to help this dish steal away your need for actual meat. Didn't try the Rueben, but I was told that it was delicious.<br><br>We had great customer service throughout the visit! Out server was very knowledgeable and patient while we deliberated over all the great looking options. Very attentive, never had an empty glass of water or coffee. Those in house made shakes were the kicker as well. A few options for \"adult\" shakes didn't exactly hurt!<br><br>All in all, it was really a great experience. The one negative I have is that they do seem to have only the 1 form of vegan meat, and they just do their best to transform it into whatever they're making. Turns out very solid for the most part, but every dish does have a tiny taste of similarity amongst each other. That's not a gripe most people would have, but I figured I'd at least get that bit of info out there. Other than that, I say get your butt down to Chicago Diner, whether you're vegan or not. But what do I know?

However, if you'd like to experience something close, my new hack is ordering the gyro sans tahini with a side of gooey cheese which I then slather all over my yummy pita delight. It's so good.

We're not vegan/vegetarian but heard great things about their vegan wings so we wanted to give it a try. <br><br>We probably ordered too much food but wanted to get a good sampling of everything. Here's what we ate:<br><br>Thai Chili Wings - I've had vegetarian/vegan wings before where they use a small wooden dowl to make it look like it's a bone-in drumstick, but eating seitan wings here was very different. It's a bit tough/chewy to give you that satisfaction of it being meat. The wings are coated with a heavy sauce, but I actually liked the other sauce that came with the wings since it sweetens it more. <br><br>Chilaquiles - I've had chilaquiles before, so I was hoping this would be a little different. You get a choice of eggs or with tofu. I chose eggs but in retrospect should've tried it with tofu. I usually joke about chilaquiles being just breakfast nachos and this was an overwhelming portion definitely able to feed 2 people. <br><br>Country Fried Steak - Just a large piece of seitan, battered and fried. I thought it was ok. <br><br>Chocolate Peanut Butter Milkshake - Probably the best thing we had although it's pretty difficult to mess up a milkshake. Tastes just like a regular milkshake as if it had dairy in it. <br><br>I don't know if we just had so much good food on this trip already.

My friends talked about Chicago diner for months before I actually made it there to give it a shot- and boy am I glad I finally made it. <br><br>- Ever since they first started talking about it, I knew I'd be getting the poutine- I've had veg poutine in the past in Cleveland, but the difference was that the gravy was a chunky gross looking mess. Here- it actually resembles gravy! However, Chicago diner uses a vegan cheese sauce instead of curds- curds would have made it SO much more authentic, in my opinion. That being said- I requested to change it to real cheese, and the waitress pointed out that they only have vegan cheese in that melty form that they use for the poutine, so we opted to take it as is. I've always been hesitant of fake cheese, but honestly, I didn't notice much of a difference! <br><br>- The Thai chili wings were delicious! Long strips of seitan (this was my first time trying seitan) in a delicious sauce! I loved the texture of the \"wings\" and absolutely loved the chipotle mayo type sauce they served it with.<br><br>- the titanic BLT was great! The chipotle fire sauce on it was delicious and the burger itself was good- a tad bit too dry, but still good. The fried onions were a nice touch, although a bit soft and soggy. I opted for chili on the side and it was delicious- extremely flavorful. I couldn't figure out what the falafel looking ball that came in it was, but I enjoyed it! <br><br>- I tried my friends side of Brussels sprouts, and yum! Crispy and tossed in balsamic!<br><br>- the spiked hot chocolate was good. A LOT of tequila! Which is always great, but i missed the chocolate a bit since I mainly tasted the tequila. <br><br>Service was good. Food was great! I literally wanted to try everything on the menu, and I'm sure I'll be back plenty of times to explore the menu!<br><br>-- my only advice is to give each customer more than one flimsy paper napkin.

I figure I wouldn't be so different if I were an omnivore. There's only so much of that kind of stuff you can eat, right? Truth be told, I was in the mood for an overfilled bowl full of veggies, rice and tofu (I'm boring) the night I landed here, but I was easily swayed by the seasonal specials menu. It's hard to review a place based on the specials menu, but I'm just appreciative to have so many options. Also, this place seems like it would be hangover heaven (not that I get hangovers... well, maybe once a year).<br><br>Now, about those hearts of palm crab cakes... I urge you to order them. They are *that* good! Flakey, savory, cakes of goodness and the dipping sauces are excellent. This appetizer was so irresistable, that I couldn't help but finish both cakes, realizing I wouldn't have enough room for my main course. But that's OK because I really wasn't a fan of my main course. The flautas are flavorless, IMO, even with the \"creamy green\" salsa. I don't even know how this is possible. I added hot sauce, which really didn't help. Uh, even the side of guac didn't help, even though the guac is perfectly respectable and is great over those damn-good refried beans. So, that was my dinner... guac and refried beans. The rice didn't really do it for me either.<br><br>Still, I am giving Chicago D 4 stars. I mean, you can get Prosecco! \"At the dinah?!\" (said in my best New Yawk accent, the capital of diners). You gotta love *that.* Bubbly with your burger (next time). Also, the crab cakes alone would have made me happy. And the carrot cake, which I took to go, wasn't bad the next day, either. And I like the wait staff.

Got the BBQ 'Chicken Wings' to share, then gf got the Buddha karma burger, and while I got the Reuben. Large and interesting menu sifted through, we awaited our food, and were served essentially 5 minutes within ordering. To call them chicken wings is very much a misnomer, even given the vegetarian nature of the establishment. They arrived crispy and coated in sauce, but they were very distinctly wedges or triangles, and no one would mistake them with real wings(which I had the day before). That said, they were still pretty good. A little bit too sauced in my opinion, but they were incredibly crispy throughout the entire meal, the seitan was savory enough to be a satisfying meat substitute, and the dipping sauce provided with the wings was good. I saved some to spread on my reuben. Speaking of which, very impressed with that. Had I not been told it was vegetarian, I would have believed it was just a regular high-quality reuben. While the rye wasn't pressed like I prefer it to be, the sandwich was otherwise very filling when combined with a side of sweet potato fries, and a balanced combination of 'meat' to bread to sauerkraut to dressing. This is their famous sandwich for a reason, and I approve of that. As far as the Buddha Karma burger, I had a bite of it and the combo of pineapple and chimichurri was flavorful.

But I think peanut butter cookie dough combo is the way to go.<br><br>The wings were some of the best wings I had ever had, and they weren't even real chicken. That amazed me. Another way that the Chicago Diner topped my previous vegan restaurant experiences is in the portions. I easily got more than double the amount of wings I had gotten from other vegan restaurants, for the same price. And the vegan ranch is better than most restaurant's ranch dressing. The wings were pretty spicy, but not too spicy. I also have a super high tolerance for spicy. <br><br>The place was clean, not too loud, and they played a bunch of early 2000's music that I love.

I'm glad there are options out there, but non vegetarian restaurants and their workers don't have the same concerns and care that I expect, and that I always get at the Diner. In short, this place is fantastic! If you are a vegetarian and you have never been here, you have to go soon. If you are a meat eater, you will enjoy the experience so much. No one will try to \"turn\" you. You will just have a great meal.<br><br>In full disclosure, I have to say that I worked at the Diner in 1983. I started as a dishwasher. I was a cook. I was a server. I was a manager. I spent about seven years of my life working at that amazing location at Roscoe and Halsted.

Mainly because of the reviews. While we had high expectations and hoped to have an amazing experience like many Yelpers, ours were very disappointing for multiple reasons:<br><br>First, we entered while both servers were taking their time speaking with a UPS delivery guy. My friend and I were patiently waiting to get seated and eventually took it upon ourselves to choose our seat. As the UPS guy left, we asked a server where she would like us to sit. She looked around the empty restaurant and condescendingly asked us if the booth we were standing right in front of would be okay.<br><br>After taking our order, I asked the server if I can have ice for my water. She never brought it, even when she refilled our cups. I understand servers are very busy and think of so many things at once, but after their nonchalantly condescending attitudes, I did not feel comfortable asking them for ice again and again.<br><br>Third, my friend's waffle fries were overcooked and really hard. We appreciated their understanding and gave her their Mac and Tease, but she did not think it tasted well. Vegan cheese just tasted like a powder mix with a slight taste of real/ dairy cheese. Nothing can ever replace dairy cheese.<br><br>Lastly, I ordered their Make Your Own Brunch-- omelette, hash, slice of bread, and it came with a side of sliced cantaloupe and orange. I found a piece of hair on the slice of cantaloupe. Since I already ate the omelette, hash, and slice of bread, it would've been unreasonable for me to demand not to be charged for my food. So, I told the server about the cantaloupe and just asked for a new slice instead. She did not even react to the fact that there was a piece of hair on my plate - not even a \"sorry.\" They did give me a new slice of cantaloupe, but I still couldn't take that piece of hair on my food off of my mind.<br><br>I'm glad I was able to experience this diner, especially because it has been well-known, to say the very least.

I ate a couple of bites because I was super hungry, and the vegan \"cheese\" sauce tasted a lot like watered down Velveeta. I ended up ordering the scrambled eggs Soul Bowl without the black beans (quinoa, garlic-ginger greens, mashed sweet potatoes, eggs and chimichurri). The greens had huge chunks of undercooked garlic, while the eggs and sweet potatoes were pretty forgettable. The chimichurri was the only thing that had real flavor, and I ended up putting chimi and sriracha on the entire plate. Also, it was $13. It's $1 more if you want to add avocado. <br><br>Maybe this place is more exciting if you're a vegan or vegetarian who normally subsists on seitan, tofu, fake cheese, fake bacon, fake sausage, etc. Or maybe I just didn't eat the best things they have on the menu.

Okay, they do serve a lot of omnivorous imitation stuff, but sometimes that's what I want. I wanted to see why they were so well recommended and compare their imitation to what I know. I recommend this place to everyone, but especially to new vegans as you make the transition from animal based to plant. I also find that omnivores actually prefer more of the veggie vegan foods to the imitation meat vegan foods. If you are an omnivore and are going to order imitation meat stuff, go in with the mindset of trying something new, otherwise you may end up a bit disappointed. Some imitations are great, others are yucky.

When we arrived we were told to wait 20-25 minutes. When we were entering, newly arrived people were being told 40-45.

My husband ordered the country \"steak\" which came with pesto veggies and mashed potatoes with gravy. He also ordered the chocolate chip cookie dough shake. Break down:<br><br>*Reuben: I have got to remember to order my food free of cheese. Vegan cheese, at least to me, has a very powerful flavor which can (and did) dominate the flavor. I couldn't taste the thousand island dressing. I ordered the sauerkraut on the side because I wasn't sure I'd like it, but it was pretty bland. Sloppy sandwich, but I still enjoyed it. My husband really liked the bit he tried.<br><br>*Mashed potatoes with gravy: I almost divorced my husband and was ready to marry any employee there who could replicate them. So. Flipping. Yummy. My husband also loved his. Highly recommended.<br><br>*Strawberry banana shake: Amazing! It doesn't say strawberry banana shake on the menu, but when I saw strawberry I asked if they could make strawberry banana and she said yes. Even my husband, who usually thinks banana overpowers most foods, thought it had the right strawberry/ banana balance of flavors. Highly recommended.<br><br>*Country \"steak\": It is made with seitan. My husband loved it, and I loved the piece I tried. Reminded me of mock chicken leg only better then the kind they give you in school for lunch. Highly recommended.<br><br>*Pesto veggies: meh, plain even with the pesto.<br><br>*Chocolate chip cookie dough shake: My husband almost divorced me and was ready to marry any employee there who could replicate it. His eyes absolutely lit up when he tried it, he said it was the best chocolate chip cookie dough shake he's ever had. I tried a bit and loved it. I usually can't find a good vegan liquid/ syrup chocolate, but they've figured it out or found it.

I had arrived incredibly excited to finally have the chance to eat at this super-hyped restaurant only to be disappointed to find that it was just comfort food. There isn't anything wrong with that -- I just thought they had more-gourmet offerings. Now that I can take it for what it is, this time I enjoyed it more.<br><br>The small diner was pretty crowded for a Wednesday afternoon. There isn't much of a waiting area when you arrive so if you need to wait for a table, you usually do so outside the door to the main dining room. In the summer, they also offer outside seating in the back. The decor is 50's diner style with red diner tables and classic diner chairs. After hemming and hawing over the menu choices, I finally placed my order. I started with an Izze and a small bowl of the macaroni and cheeze. The last time I came here, I didn't care for the macaroni and cheeze, but everyone raves about so I gave it another try. It is basically just noodles with Daiya vegan cheese. I thought it was okay, but certainly not exceptional and nothing special. Nothing really compares with the mac 'n cheese at Soul Vegetarian's Exodus in DC, but that is for another post.  Another patron actually turned around and asked if that was the best mac 'n cheese I'd ever had and I politely told him that it wasn't and told him about Soul Veg. Come to find out that the couple also travels and eats out at vegan restaurants so we engaged in an interesting discussion. I was there by myself so I didn't mind at all.<br><br>Based upon my waitress' recommendation, I ordered the Titanic BLT Burger. I half knew that this was not going to be a good idea, but I wanted to try it anyway. I also ordered some ginger garlic flashed greens on the side. This burger was humongous. The seitan patty was made with corn, peppers, and onions and it was topped with Uptons Naturals bacon, cheeze, French-fried onions, lettuce, tomato, and vegan BBQ mayo.<br><br>When I finally put the top on the burger, I couldn't get it into my mouth -- it was that big. I should have taken this as a sign and not have eaten the whole thing, but I did anyway and paid for it dearly. I liked the seitan burger, but it was just way too big. It all went together well -- even the onion rings. The only thing I didn't really care for was the Uptons Naturals bacon. While it is more like bacon than the tempeh bacon I usually eat, I found it to be rubbery and hard. Next time, I'd prefer not to have the bacon.<br><br>The ginger garlic kale that I had on the side was fantastic. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly.<br><br>As a side note, I am really glad that my waitress asked if I wanted vegan cheese when I requested cheese on my burger. I keep forgetting that they are a vegetarian restaurant and that they serve milk products. When I asked my waitress why they don't just go vegan she said that if it was up to her, they would, but the reason they aren't is because they'd lose a lot of their regular patrons. She said the breakfast is popular and they serve a lot of eggs and cheese. That is a shame. But, oh well.<br><br>Chicago Diner is a great place to go for lunch, but it is easy to eat too much there. After my meal, I actually went into a full-on food coma from eating that entire burger. I actually had to take a nap and felt almost sick -- not from the food, but from eating too much.<br><br>All in all, the service was great, the prices were reasonable at only $10 per entree, and the food was good comfort food. Although I didn't order dessert during this meal, they are very well-known for their desserts and if you can make room, I'd recommend you try them.

This tastes exactly like any super delicious reuben you would get at any diner or pub. I dont know how they make seitan taste like meat but they do. It's so delicious. I would actually venture to say their reuben is better than most you get at a deli or pub with a fraction of the grease and fat. Absolutely delicious and filling and oh-so wholesome and tasty.

The Chicago Diner takes the misconception that vegetarian/vegan food is \"bland & boring\" to rest. Their food is very flavorful & hearty. Definitely yummy veggie comfort food. The Diner has such a vast menu, which is soooo refreshing for me as a vegan, since at most restaurants, I'm lucky if I can find a handful (if even) of food options to eat. If anything, at the Chicago Diner, It's actually hard to select something to eat here - but - that's not a complaint! More like, can I get one of everything please? ;) <br><br>And, even meat eaters will not feel left out. I've dined here many times with some of my militant carnivore friends, and even they have wound up loving the food from here - including foods they may not have tried otherwise. I've been going to this restaurant since the late 80's - early 90's & have remained a devoted fan of this place ever since. I cannot express enough what a pleasure it is as a vegan to have so many great choices to choose from on their menu.<br><br>Although I usually order the same thing every time - my favorite being the \"Tofu Scramble Jubilee\". I have actually overheard strangers on the street talking about how much they love that dish - and I chimed in to agree. It's *that* good. Although since I initially drafted this review - I heard they took that off the menu (* insert Ferris Bueller-esque \"Nooooooooo\"... echo*  ;)  But other favorites dishes there of mine are their vegan nachos (and the portions are large enough to share with a friend) veggie chili, various soups... And for desserts - their vegan Chocolate Raspberry cake & Blueberry Muffins are to die for! Dang, I'm getting hungry just writing about it. <br><br>Also, they have great drinks. In particular, I love their blueberry margaritas, which are sweet, very fresh & refreshing. But - they are quite strong. They don't skimp out on the alcohol - so that is always a plus as you're getting your money's worth (unlike most tradional bars) But - as a heads up - these margaritas are very potent (well - from what I recall anyway, after stumbling out of there a couple times. lol :) <br><br>The actual diner itself is on the small size and tends to be rather busy, especially on the weekends, where it gets even more loud & cramped. I prefer to be seated in the booths - as it is more intimate/private - yet with more room - unlike the tables in the middle where you can wind up dining with complete strangers - or get bumped into all the time. So - I wait til a booth opens up. Or - sit in the back in their patio section - which is nice when the weather permits. <br><br>The main con however is the service in general. The wait staff tends to be inattentive. I have felt ignored waiting to be seated and the food can take awhile too. Sometimes even just to get a glass of water before you order your food. However, it's not like that all the time, and the past couple times I've been there, the service was better & friendlier. <br><br>Overall, the food is definitely worth it - delicious, filling, healthy comfort food. And, there is something for *everyone* there to eat... for vegans, vegetarians & carnivores alike - we can *all* get along at the Chicago Diner ;)<br><br>Pros: Great tasting food, Healthy dishes, Huge diverse menu <br>Cons: Poor service, Long waits , Loud and cramped place", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I've been a fan of Chicago Diner for about 10 years.

The menu is, as should be expected based on the name, centered on traditional diner fare, burgers, milkshakes, meatloaf, and the like, but with the twist that everything is either vegan or has a vegan option. For example, the nachos come with cheese which can be omitted or substituted for vegan cheese. The dishes mainly substitute meat for seitan, though the menu easily allows someone who's seitan adverse to order dishes that would already be vegetarian. In particular, I'm fond of the nachos (with or without the seitan chorizo), the black bean burger (which is, in my opinion, one of the best black bean burgers offered in the Chicago area), and the perfectly crispy sweet potato fries.

A note for vegans: everything on the menu can be ordered vegan, with soy dairy (or, for cheese lovers, with the dairy version).<br><br>I'm not wild about all of that comfort food stuff.

<br><br>I sat down and I had two wait staff people.I noticed that it was only arm room only up in there.I was given a glass of water that had cucumber slices in it.This changed the taste of the water dramatically, but no so much for the worst ,just not as delicious as maybe filtered water with a twist of lemon or lime in it. <br><br>I decided to order the sandwich combo because i figured that would be easy for me.I got the Gyro with a side of sweet potato fries.Ill just say that they tried their best..I don't think a non-vegetarian would be pleased completly.Since I'm a vegetarian I'll give it 4 stars.This meal would have been given a2 or a 3 by someone that maybe was expecting the comparison to be a little bit closer in taste to a real Gyro.The pita fries weren't the best, but they has a sweet taste and i think they were homemade. <br><br>I got a second entree to take home with me and i purchased the Reuben sandwich with a side order of mac and <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcheese.My&s=f93d00bf592103980f331d769934cfb0b98294a2f597d01edb86eb39c77e466a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">cheese.My</a> personal opinions have to be hidden since i think i might not like Reuben sandwiches to begin with.I don't want to hinder anyone from the experience of a great tasting sandwich. <br><br>I had them add Daiya cheese and the other stuff that comes with it didn't appeal to my tastebuds..This is not to say that i wont finish my sandwich.I'm just saying i wouldn't be ordering this again.The mac and cheese in the \"to go\" tray was just a dollop and not really that much.I was upset since vegan Mac and cheese is tasty..I enjoyed the little of it that i could. <br><br>That's all for now but i want everyone to know that to me this place is a 4 star but for others i could fairly say that today's entrees would have to be a 3.. <br><br>But it's really funny the loyalty us Vegetarians have to our restaurants.Even though i wasn't the happiest with todays selection, i refuse to give this place a bad review..I see potential, and i wont give a bad review to an establishment that puts together a good presentation at least. <br><br>I know i can be weird like that with my reviews.Maybe I'm just an ass-kisser in denial, or a crowd follower that doesn't want to give this place a bad review..Ill let you know next year when i come here again and try a third entree...They do say three times a charm.I wont drop any stars until i know about the third meal..if it's good then ill boost them up a star, if their bad then ill drop them down one!

Burgers here are also very delicious, although I'm not a fan of the \"bacon\". Then again I never liked bacon when I ate meat. You can always find a good breakfast here too. While their shakes are scrumptious and GMO free, I would wish they were not soy based and perhaps instead hemp or almond based.

If you're a Mac and cheese fan I wouldn't have high hope for theirs. While it's not bad, it's nothing compared to Soul Veg's. While I'm not a cake person, their cheesecake is pretty good and would recommend trying a slice at some point. However ordering a cake from their bakery is a nightmare. I had to call and receive calls back nearly six times over a two week time span for a graduation cake order. All I wanted was a red velvet one layer sheet cake with the frosting and blue decor on top congratulating my brother. They told me originally this was no problem. Over the next couple phone calls I was told they don't make red velvet anymore. Then I was told that they can't do sheet cakes anymore. Since I was not paying for it, I could not convince my mother to try another vegan bakery after this. From an activist stand point that sees this as an opportunity to turn a crowd of nearly 70 people onto a delicious vegan option, I saw this mess up with Chicago Diner as a truly shameful failure and would only wish that whoever is taking special orders has all the correct information for the sake of future customers for I will not be one of them returning to the bakery anytime soon.

It's a tiny place, but it was abundantly staffed, and they all worked together to make it an excellent experience.<br><br>That said, I would have tolerated abysmal service  just to have more of the food! We started with the buffalo \"wings,\" which were absolutely amazing (also, I don't remember ranch ever tasting so nomnom before I went veg*n!). I had the pumpkin raviolis, The Boy had the bacon (vegan-)cheddar burger, and we finished it off with the chocolate mousse cake. Every part was absolutely perfect - unique, extremely flavorful, and well worth the very reasonable prices.<br><br>We travel to Chicago several times each year for concerts and other events, and we've always made a point to to visit Karyn's Cooked each and every time.

As a vegetarian, I acknowledge that I may be a bit biased, but this seriously is a place that people of all diets can enjoy. The worst mistake you can make is to think that the only thing you'll find on the menu is steamed kelp or gluten-free wheat germ tacos with watercrest mole. <br><br>The menu fluctuates according to the season, so depending on how often you go, you may never see the same menu twice.

I'd say the best meal I've had there was a lentil based meatloaf which could effortlessly beat the hell out of your grandmother's recipe that she learned from the Dione Lucas Cooking Show. Basically, their dishes that are meant to resemble meat actually do taste like the real thing. <br><br>Since Chicago Diner makes an effort to go organic on just about everything on the menu, this includes the coffee. I can't think of any other place that serves a more flavorful cup of coffee. They could build an addition to start a coffee bar and run Starbucks right out of Lakeview.

She is getting off work after 6:00 pm and we should go somewhere for dinner. So we all agree on the Chicago Diner. <br><br>It's a cute little place, looks very clean and everyone that works in Chicago Diner is extremely friendly! We start out our meal with a few appetizers. We ordered the Hummus, the Potstickers and the Taquitos. The Hummus was excellent, I just love Hummus. It was almost as good as the Hummus I had at Semiramis (read an earlier review of mine), which is probably the best Hummus around. The Potstickers, our daughter recommended, she has been here before. She just loved the flavor and taste of the Potstickers. I would have to agree with her, they were very flavorful and tasty. We all thought they were very good. I was the only one who tried the Taquitos and I thought they were very good too. I thought nice and crispy and tasty. The dipping sauces added a little extra punch and flavor to the Taquitos too. <br><br>For our main courses our daughter ordered the Caesar Wrap, Maria ordered the Mushroom Ravioli and I ordered the Philly Cheese Steak. We all sampled each others dishes. We all agreed my Philly Cheese Steak was the best. The faux steak was good, you could not tell it wasn't real meat. Our daughter's Caesar Wrap was good. Again I could not tell that it was a vegetarian dish. We all thought Maria's Mushroom Ravioli dish was just ok. It was the only true average dish of the whole meal. <br><br>We all ordered drinks too. I ordered a Banana and Blueberry smoothie, I love smoothies. It was very good! It was a dark blue color, from the blueberries and a strong banana flavor. Maria and our daughter both order tea for their drinks. <br><br>So overall we highly recommend Chicago Diner. Our total bill came to roughly $65 dollars for drinks, three appetizers and three main courses. A lot of food we thought for the price. It is a tough call though because Maria thought for a vegetarian place this was five stars but only four stars for an overall restaurant. Our daughter truly loves this place. I thought this was a four and a half star place, sooo close to five stars though.

The Portabella wrap was a little bland and completely fell apart. Their reuben is absolutely amazing. I never liked Reuben's when I was an omni, but this one was amazing.

I usually leave asking why I went again.<br><br>First off, I should mention the Chicago Diner is going to move directly across the street soon. Hopefully this will solve some of the seating problems.

Visitors know of it and flock to it, but it just isn't that good! Many of the faux meat items I have had tried are either rubbery (most recently, the chicken style seitan in the stir fry) or overly greasy (chicken parmesan sandwich). I just think that the reputation this place has, coupled with it's long history should lead to much tastier food. They do a few things well, the vegan mac and cheese is pretty tasty, but overall I find this place inconsistent. The only thing that I have  ever ordered more than once is the biscuits and gravy, which are good... but can't touch the Handlebar's.<br><br>One good thing about the Chicago Diner (and the thing that got them three stars instead of two) is that the desserts are excellent. They have great vegan cakes and cheesecakes. They also have great vegan milkshakes, they aren't cheap (6 bucks!) but, they are pretty damn good. If you have to go, get a coffee and dessert, that way you won't be disappointed.<br><br>I almost feel bad, as a long time vegan, giving this place a less than glowing review. I am glad it's there, but I just wish they would work to make it better. When I travel to places like New York, I get a taste of what can be done with vegan food (Red Bamboo, S'nice, ad infinitum) and the Diner isn't in the same league, not even close.<br><br>November 15, 2007 EDIT: I have since found a very good sandwich at the Chicago Diner. The Radical Reuben. It is thickly stacked with seitan, sauerkraut, and a side of vegan 1000 island dressing.  A side of the vegan mac and cheese and you have a great meal.

There was a \"half-hour\" wait to get inside the restaurant so we waited outside in the cold with a bunch of fellow patrons also waiting to get inside. Oh, and, by the way, these \"regulars\" of the Chicago Diner all reeked of musty hippi stank and patchouli and made the cold air even more unbearable. Soooo, we waited and waited for what was much longer than a half-hour. Finally, we were able to be seated,  but only at the counter. Now normally, I wouldn't mind sitting at the counter. In fact, I think it's quite fun! It brings back warm childhood nostalgia of sipping milkshakes and blowing papers of straws at the passing people. But this counter was ridiulously cramped and we had to listen to the pretentious waitstaff talk to their customers about how they're really \"actors and models\" and this waiter gig is just part-time. Whatever, dudes. Just bring us some f'ing meat-free ice water, okay? <br><br>We were eventually waited on and, since we were starving in line for two hours, we started off with an appetizer: the bbq ribs.

Well, the vegetarian gyros probably wasn't all that bad except that I couldn't really tell what it tasted like since I had to chew through a pound of burnt char. Is char a word? I don't know if it is, but it should be one solely to describe this vegetarian gyros. As for the rueben, I think I saw tears well up in my bf's eyes as he tried to choke the sucker down. Poor little guy. I felt bad for him so I rubbed his little tummy and treated him to a coldstone creamery concoction with TWO mix-ins after din-din.<br><br>All in all, the wait was bad at this restaurant, the crowded ambience was terrible, service sucked (and was a little hipster-snobby), and the food was pretty bad, as well.

Although they have gluten free bread there is no gf French toast option and no offer to accommodate by request.  Every vegan restaurant in Toronto and many other major cites makes a gf pancake, they do not- which I find strange since they have gone to the effort of offering a separate gluten free menu.  They were out of several dishes/ingredients including quinoa and corn cakes which most of the gf options were based on if one avoids soy, this was at noon on a Saturday.  I ordered the only option left, a grilled cheese on gf bread with daiya cheese, deliciously done but with totally superfluous lettuce, tomato, cucumber added, a chewed up pickle on the side and a tiny portion of the side order of kale salad which was oily kale with shredded carrot, no other dressing not even salt.  Overall it didn't feel like much effort is made here, with no almond or rice milk available for coffee as well, it felt like I was getting as many 'no\"s' as a vegan does in any other resto.  <br>Service was cavalier as well.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I haven't been to the Chicago Diner in many years however I get to have their food every summer at a music festival.

Ive found that a few meat-eating companions do enjoy the fare, as the menu appeals to the tried and to vegan, to the flexotrian(one who eats meat but sometimes enjoys vegetarian cuisine) and everyone inbetween.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "\"Meat Free Since 1983\"!  With a slogan like that, what sane vegetarian wouldn't want to try this place out? I fell in love instantly! There is no greater feeling for a vegetarian then to look at the whole menu and be able to order ANYTHING and EVERYTHING off of it! It's so liberating! :0) And let me tell you, everything on the Chicago Diner menu is wonderful! I prefer to eat there around their brunch hours, because you get the best of both worlds, the yummy breakfast stuff and lunch options as well. <br>I always try different dishes every time I go and I often drag non veggies with me, and we are always pleased with what we get!<br>For the non veggies out there, let me explain something. The Chicago Diner uses tofu, seitan, and tempeh to give the vegetarian meals some bulk and make it more filling and more interesting. They use these soy products to have \"fake\" bacon, Reuben sandwiches, fillet sandwich, gyros, etc. The list could go on and on! It is amazing what they do with soy! Truly!<br><br>But don't worry not all things have a soy product in them! They use real eggs, and they have stir fries and other things without the \"fancy veggie soy products\". Some things we have tried and loved: For an App. we all loved the nachos with seitan chorizo.<br>For meals: Cowboy Chili, Black Bean Burger, Radical Reuben, Green Eggs & \"Ham\", the home style potatoes, and pretty much all of the desserts are fantastic! If I had to pick I would say Cookies and Cream cake is my favorite!<br><br>The atmosphere is very much old time diner, it's pretty small but in a cozy way. The staff is always very friendly and it's always busy, but you never really have to wait that long. But if it is right in the middle of a prime time to eat out, plan on waiting, maybe even outside. So dress warm! But it is completely and totally worth the wait. In the summer, they have a great back patio and they also have parking which is free during the evening and I believe on weekends as well. <br><br>If you don't like something, if it's not cooked right, just send it back or tell them, they are always happy to please. I got a complimentary dessert when I thought my seitan was a little tough. <br><br>The Diner is always updating their menu by adding great new dishes, which makes it fun for regulars like me!  Check out their website, it's really fantastic...has pretty much the whole menu with prices etc<br>I just can't say enough great things about the Diner, my husband and I love it so much that he took me there the night he proposed! It will forever have a special place in our hearts. And stomachs. :0) I hope it can win a place in yours!

This is my favorite sandwich of all time and seriously holds a piece of my heart. <br><br>It had been over a year since my last philly cheeze steak experience, but I revisited Chicago Diner last weekend and was so not disappointed. OH. MY. GOODNESS. I always try and save a half for leftovers but can never do it. I washed it all down with a pitcher of their classic margarita and could not say no to a slice of vegan lemon raspberry cake which our awesome server brought out with a bonus scoop of vegan vanilla ice cream for my two friends and I to enjoy. Both of whom I might add said they were just not down with vegan cake and would likely not be sharing any with me. Ha. We all ate up every last bite of it and agreed it was truly some serious yummyness.  If you haven't tried one of their vegan cakes, please do yourself a favor and try one! They're dense but delicious, the cookies & cream cake being my particular favorite. And the best part, they can be enjoyed practically guilt free.<br><br>The atmosphere is warm, friendly and inviting. Situated in a small house in the heart of boys town, I prefer the booths, but the back patio's awfully nice as well, especially in the spring. The servers are usually super friendly and eager to make recommendations. The music is equally cool and only adds to a great background to hang with your buds and enjoy amazingly freshly prepared veggie eats. Afterwards, I suggest moving across the street to the Town Hall Pub for more drinks. My friends bartend there and are some of the nicest girls around. Request some homemade watermelon vodka in your soda and munch on some veggie jerky and you will not be disappointed. <br><br>I wish we had a Chicago Diner in the bay area but I guess that would make it less special and one less reason for me to visit Chicago. <br>So for now, I'm happy to keep it a special Chicago treat.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I've eaten at Chicago Diner more times than I normally would.  I'm not vegan.  But, it seems like all of my vegetarian & vegan friends who live out of town flock here when they come to visit me.  I can see why, too.  One friend who has been vegan for the better part of 12 years commented that this is the only place where he can eat vegan \"American food.\"  I'm not a fan of fake meat.  So, when I'm there, I tend to eat the non-fake meat selections, or the dishes that have a small amount of the fake stuff.  I usually order the Santa Fe salad [the dressing is amazing] or the nachos.  The nachos portion is HUGE!!  All in all, the Diner is a tasty restaurant.  Oh yeah, beware of the cornbread muffins.  I was served one that could double as a hockey puck.  It made for a great laugh, though.  Wait, a couple more oh yeahs!  Their oat bar treats are amazing.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This is a jem in the city for sure!

My friends and I were there for brunch and wanted to start our meal with a Mimosa, but we were told alcoholic drinks couldn't be ordered on the patio. After waiting for nearly 40 minutes for our food, we were given sub-par food that was flavorless and cold. Our waitress, Amanda, was too busy gabbing with her co-worker to check-in with us. At one point she asked if I needed coffee but never returned with my refill. I guess it was too hard for her to break away from her conversation to do her job.

The crab cake were warm, moist and flavorful and did remind me of the  real crab cakes that my Mom use to make. The portion was just enough and I was almost finished them, when my biscuit and gravy arrived. I love biscuits and gravy and am a fan of every and all of its reincarnations, the  biscuits and gravy I got here were excellent. The best vegetarian biscuit and gravy I have ever tried.

I surely am not a vegan or a vegetarian but I am willing to try anything about once. I had the eggs with potato-tempeh hash, and biscuits, also served with a seitan sausage patty. I was a little weary of eating anything that was made to taste like anything else. The sausage patty I did not like in the least. There was no flavor, and for a meat eater maybe its because I believe it so so hard to honestly duplicate the taste. It seemed a little dry. Now for the eggs, to me an egg is an egg, cage free, free range whatever they all taste the same. The potato-tempeh hash was very delicious. It had red pepper, green peppers, and cubed potatoes and tempeh. I must say though the best was the biscuits. They were awesome very fluffy and so yummy. I am not sure what the sauce was that was served on them since it lacked flavor. The coffee was very strong (no complaints here.) My sister ordered the miso corn chowder which she said was pretty good, a large fresh orange juice, and ordered a cobb salad to go which looked huge with seitan meat strips. Our bill was $34. The waitress we had was super friendly and was great reccommending things for a non-vegan to try. It is a pretty small place maybe 15 tables.
