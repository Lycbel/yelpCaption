The stunning Carrara marble bar is sleek and stylish. The wall of tied ropes in the dining room is a nice warm touch. <br><br>The staff is amazing. Everyone was so gracious and personable. The bartenders, servers and managers really made a positive impression. <br><br>We only had appetizers in the bar area instead of a full dinner. But we tried so many things and everything was delicious. We sampled salad, empanadas, shrimp cocktail, mini chicken sandwiches, mini burgers and filet skewers. Oh my! We loved everything!<br><br>I can't wait to return for a full dinner!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Do I judge people when they visit Chicago and choose Fogo de Chão as their steakhouse? Absolutely. Do I think less of people who live in Chicago and include Fogo in their list of top steakhouses? You bet.<br><br>This isn't necessarily a tourist trap. Chain restaurants serve a purpose, and when I ate here I wasn't dissatisfied. What most people will highlight is that the Churrasco experience, in which waiters with skewers of succulent meat walk around and slice an unlimited amount of it for you tableside, is a great bang for your buck. What might not be clear to the uninitiated is that this costs $56 and isn't anything special.<br><br>This environment (with the perceived \"deal\") attracts a random mix of people. Expect to see a lot of men with untucked shirts that flow like dresses. Weird family members that emerge from basements to celebrate high school milestones, etc. Kind of like how I would picture a Vegas buffet (e.g. people had to make *some* effort to get there but not a whole lot). The menu is extremely limited, with no appetizers really aside from an extensive salad bar called the market table (note: there appears to be a lobster & shrimp appetizer now, I don't remember this).<br><br>You have the big salad bar and, as you'd imagine, nobody uses it. Everyone wants to maximize their intake of red meat and lamb. So why does every other skewer contain chicken? Because, you fool, businesses need to make money.<br><br>You get some red meat and, by god, is it delicious. More skewers. More steak. The big knives. Slice by slice you're taking it down and you love life. You even eat a little chicken and that's good too. You're a king. A big Brazillian king.<br><br>Forty-five minutes in you realize that the average human stomach can only handle so much dense protein. It doesn't matter how big you are or how manly you think you are. The amount of training (and genetic fortune) that it would take to actually make a dent in Fogo de Chão's bottom line--to objectively get a \"deal\"--is out of reach for most people. Plus, along the way, you'll have to decline the chicken (and pork?) more than a dozen times, which starts to make things awkward.<br><br>This place is good, but, in Chicago, I find that their value proposition is quite mediocre and attracts a lot of people who don't know any better.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This place has gone downhill in a spectacular fashion. The quality of the meat is absolutely terrible now.  If you enjoy a plate full of gristle and sinew, then this is the place for you.  There were times when I waited with a green card and an empty plate for 20 minutes for someone to come by, only to receive an inedible ball of beef fat.  <br><br>It seems like they don't bring you filet unless you specifically ask for it now.  The guy with the chicken must've come by 20 times before I asked if filet was still something they served. 10 minutes after that, someone finally showed up and begrudgingly dropped 2 slivers of filet on my table before running off to the kitchen again without visiting any other tables.<br><br>Save your $60 and go elsewhere. Chama Gaucha is a bit of a drive from the city, but it's currently several steps above this place and well worth the trip if you're craving the same experience.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I was so disappointed in this place!

Fine and dandy except other waiters are coming around asking if you would like the meat included in the price<br>-meat options were limited (at least when we came) and it seemed like the likelihood of getting meat was highly dependent on where you sat (so often my husband would see something he wanted, but by the time it got near our table, there was no more of that specific meat. And then the waiter wouldn't come back with more)<br>-charge $3.50 for a mini glass bottle of soda<br><br>Overall: disappointed and wasn't worth the price. Brazilian steakhouses usually have lavish salad bars, variety of meat selections making their way to you, and authentic. I was turned off by the waiter trying to trick you into purchasing an expensive shrimp cocktail, charging $3.50 for not even a reasonable quantity of soda (with no refills), and the inconsistent availability of the meats.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "My experience at this Fogo location was alright...I wasn't very impressed.

We all went for the full Churrasco experience. The quality of the salad bar was subpar - I saw flies landing on the pineapple and papaya sections. The mozzarella slices weren't fresh, though the proscuitto and smoked salmon were delicious!<br><br>My fave cut of meat is the House Special Picanha, which was seasoned well and cooked through. Our main gripe with the service is that some of the meats never made it to our table, such as the Top and Bottom Sirloin.

We kept on asking for the other meats, but they sadly never came to our table.<br><br>My fave part of the meal was the cheese balls so addicting! I also loved the fried polenta and garlic mashed potatoes on our table.<br><br>After tax and tip, our meal was about $70. For that high price, I don't think my experience at this Fogo was worth it.

Although it's a \"buffet,\" the atmosphere inside comes off quite upscale so this would make a great date spot.

You start here before indulging in any of the meats.<br><br>Once you've settled in and enjoyed some of the appetizers, flip over the small coaster-size button on your table. Once you give the green \"Go Ahead!\" men with meat will begin stopping by and offering different cuts of beef, pork, chicken, and lamb. Literally slabs of delicious meats hanging from skewers are sliced in front of you, and you can choose how red you like yours. For me, rare = heaven.<br><br>Warning- while extremely delicious, this could be very overwhelming! You'll likely end up biting off a bit more than you can chew but that's okay. Make sure you at least try their Filet Mignon and House Sirloin.

You can opt out of the meat and just get the buffet. It's slightly cheaper. They do have a fish entree you can order - that's what my friend did who doesn't eat meat.<br><br>The reason I rate this low is that it just didn't feel like anything special. It was a fancy overpriced buffet. Servers rarely came around to refill water once we got started. And the cocktail I ordered was mostly fruit, like almost no liquid. Super disappointing.

Ended up paying around $140 for 2 people with tax and tip. Don't come here if you're trying to impress a girl.

It includes free drinks and a dessert. It's AMAZING.  If you want to make the most of it, do not eat anything beforehand and PACE YOURSELF. It's tempting to get everything but it's okay to decline some meats. I suggest getting the bacon wrapped beef rib, any of the sirloins, and the beef rib. They save the best meat last until the very end of your meal. They do that on purpose so you can fill your stomach with other foods and have less room for the beef rib.  The beef rib is sooooooo good. It's served warm and it melts in your mouth like butter. You can savor it in your mouth. You can also ask for sauces to go with your meat. My favorite is the chimichurri sauce. They also have horseradish, mint jelly, A1 sauce, BBQ sauce. Don't use the sauces for the beef rib. If you do, it's like you committed a crime. The beef rib itself is all you need. <br><br>The waiters come in and out with meats on poles and they carve it in front of you and you pick up the slice with the mini tongs they give you. They also give you cards where it tells the waiter if you want more meat. Red means no and green means yes. <br><br>The salad bar is really good. Their papayas are so fresh and you need to try some. It's like you're eating them in Mexico. Their yogurt parfaits are alright. My friend said it's like McDonalds. <br><br>For drinks, you need to get the LIMEADE. SO GOOD and refreshing.  It's bottomless so they keep giving you another cup if you're finished. It's the best drink there. <br><br>They also give you side dishes like caramelized bananas, garlic mashed potatoes, fried potato sticks, and endless soft cheesy bread rolls. <br><br>Don't forget to ask for the dessert menu! I got the molten chocolate cake and it was a taste of heaven. Please do get it. I think it's the best dessert on their menu. You won't regret it. <br><br>By the end of the meal, you will probably gain 5 pounds but it's worth it. I don't know how much this deal is exactly because people treated me.

Typically that is all I need to do but then I received 3 cold scripted phone calls from a male Fogo employee to confirm my reservation. He didn't leave a name but mentioned to call at my earliest connivence. I found it amazing that each call was the same script word for word and lasted exactly 15 seconds. <br><br>I was called on Wednesday, Thursday & Friday. I did call back on Friday & a girl answered the phone. I told her I had received three messages about my reservation that was coming up on Sunday. I then asked her if it was customary to be harassed via phone after setting up a confirmed reservation on OpenFail. She responded, \"Sure!\"  I said, \"Did you even listen to my question?\" She then said, \"I need to put you on hold!\" This is where she left me. Sitting on hold & no one picked me up. I eventually got disconnected. Surprise! Not! I was so not happy at this point and I wasn't going to waste my time by calling back a second time. I had an online confirmed reservation and that should be good enough. Why do I need to speak with the restaurant?  I received way too many phone calls & then when I call back I'm treated like crap. Not fun!<br><br>Our party of 11 arrived for our reservation at 12:30pm on Sunday. I told the hostess we had arrived. She asked us to wait in the lobby. I then noticed a waiter moving tables around trying to get it set up for a party of 11 people. I realized that they were making our table which was suppose to be ready at 12:30. <br><br>I went back to her and said, \"Did you have my OpenFail reservation in your computer for 12:30?\"<br>The hostess said, \"Yes!\"<br>I then said, \"Why wasn't my table ready for my parties arrival?\"<br>She said, \"We had an unexpected table of 11 arrive and we gave them your table!\"<br>I said, \"That makes no sense!\"<br>She then said in a snotty tone, \"They're  making your table now!\"<br>I walked away biting my tongue and not wanting to make a scene. <br><br>First of all an apology would be nice from the hostess or a manager. I got neither. We spent almost $600 on lunch and they start out our day acting like we weren't important. I wish we would have walked and went to a restaurant that cared. <br><br>Secondly the hostess is a complete liar. I walked around the restaurant and there was no other party of eleven anywhere in the restaurant. Complete lies from the front of the house. This is unacceptable and rude. Don't treat me like I am stupid and this is my first time making a reservation. Plus I can count to 11 too...thanks to my elementary school education. <br><br>Thirdly why should I have my party wait 10-12 minutes while we stand in the lobby watching them build our table that was suppose to be ready at 12:30pm. A complete fail. This is some of the worse customer service I have ever experienced.  <br><br>On a side note the restaurant wasn't even crowded when we arrived. Our table could have been built prior to our arrival but the restaurant choose to not do this. I'm assuming that this arrogance comes from the top down. Cold scripted multiple phone calls attempting to confirm an already existing reservation. Leaving me on hold when I do call back and a snotty lying hostess who gets mad at me for being right.

We waited to be seated until 6:55. The hostess takes us back and can't find the table she was planning to seat us at. We move into another area...no table there either! Instead of roaming around the dining area, I tell her we will go have a seat until she figures out what's going on. We wait longer, my friend approaches to get an approximate time, and she's told by the hostess that she really doesn't know. I walk up at 7:25 and she still cannot offer me any timeframe of when we will be seated, and asks if I'd like to speak to a manager.<br><br>Brian was like an angel sent from God. He immediately apologized, took us back to be seated, and on the walk back offered us free drinks. There was a minor issue - the table he tried to seat us at was a two person table and we were a party of three. He immediately troubleshot the issue with the help of a wonderful waiter and they got us set up at another table around 7:30. Once we were situated, he brought over our free drinks and also surprised us with a complimentary shrimp cocktail. Classy move and much appreciated. <br><br>The food itself was great, but the service (aside from Brian) was completely lackluster. We were never given menus, my friend had to request lamb on four separate occasions before they brought it, we didn't know who our waiter was, and no one came back to pick up our check so we could pay and leave. My friend literally had to get up from the table and walk the check and credit card over to a waiter who was across the room. <br><br>Speaking of the check, not only did they comp the drinks and shrimp cocktail, but they were also gracious enough to give each of us a free dessert as well. I appreciated them trying to right the wrongs, and am grateful for the compensations, however, there were so many things wrong tonight that I can't say it was a great experience.<br><br>I'd give it another shot on down the road when it's not Valentine's Day and would be less busy.

Because I come from a city in New Jersey, about 20 minutes away, by train, from New York City that's full of some of the best food the Lusophone (Portuguese) world has to offer. Almost every restaurant is delicious, quirky and perfect in its own way, which is why I've never cared much for chains. I didn't have to! How could a huge, publicly traded restaurant replicate such an experience, so far away (distance-wise) from its origins?<br><br>Well, I think at the Chicago location, at least, they did just that. Chicago has a way of really happening in the quiet, almost secretive of ways. You walk in to a space, or at least I did multiple times while in Chicago, and thought to myself, wow this place is dead. Not more than 5 steps forward and a dozen tiny groups were to my right. Some were on dates, others having what looked like a family dinner, a girls' night in one corner and guys' night in the other, and all were happily enjoying their food and each other. <br><br>We were a minute or two late for our already altered reservation for the night, but the hostess made no issue of my guilt, and kindly showed my boss lady and I to a nice little table. Maurice was the first waiter to attend to us and kindly helped us with our jackets and offered us water, drinks and taught us the lay of the land. I got a passion fruit caipirinha, a nice concoction of passion fruit juice, sugar, lime and Brazilian firewater. <br><br>Upon being seated, you'll notice something that looks like a coaster for your drink that's red on one side and green on the other. This will be your tell to those bringing around those delicious meats whether you're up for another bite, or if you simply cannot take another. Before your mouth begins to salivate however, there's an entire buffet full of rice, feijoada (Afro-luso-pork,beef and bean stew) farofa (cassava flour), to be enjoyed atop. Not to mention as many fresh veggies, salads of all kinds, fruit and a slew of other things that could fill you up BEFORE the meats start coming 'round. Be careful!<br><br>The meats of the rodizio came and went. There were sausages, chicken, filet mignon, ribs, lamb - just about anything you could think of and just as soon as your plate was dirty, within seconds, much like a well-choreographed dance, another plate warm, an invitation to eat more food, was placed on the table ready for another go at the buffet and NEW rodizio meats. <br><br>If you're not careful, soon you'll be full and happy without any space for dessert or another drink. You may judge yourself a little, I did, but it's at this point that you should thank yourself. You deserved a good dinner, great service, and sweet, non-judgmental smiling faces seemingly happy to see you happy with them. And all the while, at least three separate occasions, a lovely woman, a manager perhaps, came over and asked how we were enjoying anything and if there was anything special that we wanted, all we had to do was ask. She was right and this dinner was one of the best that I've had in quite some time.<br><br>I've been away from home and I try my best to get over twice a year or so, but a four-hour train ride away rests a beautiful city, with one of my newest, favorite restaurants, <br>Fogo de Chão and I so look forward to coming back.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Finally..Fugo de O Yeah!!!!<br>Most important thing- go there if you are an 'eater' - meaning, if you can EAT..

I've eaten at the Fogo's in Sao Paulo and service is impeccable there. At this location, it was a complete 180. Our waiter hardly ever came around to check on us. When he did, he always asked us if we wanted a couple of specific meats brought over. We would tell him and he would say he would direct someone over to us. This never happened. Our server did this multiple times to us. I then asked another server for some chimmichuri sauce to put on the meat and this never appeared. At one point, the manager came over and asked how we were doing and I brought up the Chimmichuri sauce. He then went back and got it himself which was a saving grace for them. <br><br>When the meats were brought over, I asked for mine medium rare and 90% of the time, the waiter said \"Oh yes. This one right here is medium rare.\" before cutting the meat. When he walked away and I had a chance to look at the slice on my plate, it was almost always well done. The guys with the meat are idiots. <br><br>When we were finally done, I asked for the dessert menu which took forever to come. We knew what we wanted to order for dessert but had to wait almost 15 minutes before someone else came over to take our order. I ordered the creme de papaya which was terrible and not at all like the creme de papaya in Brazil. I then told our server how bad it was and didn't want any other dessert to eat. I was so angry by then. The waiter offered to give me a free new dessert but I just didn't want to stay there anymore. My fiance ended up getting the creme brulee which was actually good. <br><br>I left pretty full but extremely disappointed and will never come back here again.

However, I only knew what one was (the filet) because I could barely understand the staff serving the meat because they spoke softly and it was so loud in there. The filet was the only cut I liked. I asked for medium rare...but it was more rare than I normally like. On other cuts, I usually had big chucks of fat I needed to remove. A couple next to us was complaining about the same thing.

Here's a tip, save the plantains for desert.  The Picanha (house special), filet and top sirlion were all good. The other cuts of meat were way too fatty for my liking. <br><br>About halfway through my meal, I had finished my glass of wine and kept looking for my server. She never re-appeared the rest of the night. It's possible she went home, but I was never told this and left wondering who to talk to if I needed something. About 10 minutes later a manager came over and asked if I wanted some more wine, and I ordered another glass. <br><br>The service from the staff when it came to offering more food was excellent. At the end, the manager asked if I wanted anything else. I asked for a little more of the filet. The last cut was very fatty and I didn't eat it. Maybe it was just a bad piece of meat. <br><br>When the bill came I noticed there was a charge for $11.95 that I did not recognize. When I asked, I was told it was for a drink that I had order from one of the strolling waiters who had come to my table, like any the meat carvers and offered it to me. When he offered it to me, there was no mention of an additional charge. I told the manager this and they quickly removed the $11.95. <br><br>So, in summary, some of the meat was really good, others not as much. My dissapearing server and surprise $11.95 charge also created negative feelings toward the place.  I had a $25 off coupon, so the bill was only $53 instead of $78, which made the experience a bit more palatable. Would I go back again, probably not.

I love meat, but the flavor/quality of the meats were subpar in my opinion. The ribeye/beef cuts were very one note in their flavor (that note being salt) and the cuts were not very tender - I requested rare, it came rare, but was still surprisingly tough and didn't taste exciting. The lamb/sausage/chicken were actually pretty good, but the lamb is the only thing that stood out. I am very curious as to the marbling of the cuts of meat as well as their meat resting process. <br><br>The service however was pretty great. There were servers and 'floor managers?' that made sure individual table requests were met. Everyone was very pleasant and eager to help - this to me is what makes the place great. I also enjoy not having to agonize over menu options and how quick you can sit down and eat. <br><br>Overall, I'm glad I went - I just don't think I'll go again as there wasn't a meat I had that was particularly memorable.

However, the items I did select were so fresh and flavorful.

Soon there were gauchos popping up presenting various skewers. Each of the meats that they offered us were piping hot and very tasty. My favorite was the fraldinha (bottom sirloin). So tender and full of flavor. I requested they bring in around again before we left. The house special picanha was a close second.<br><br>Even for such a busy Saturday night our server was very attentive and made sure all of our needs were met. The restaurant manager was also floating around from table to table making sure everyone's dining experience was up to standard.

Within a minute of flipping my card to green, my plate is full of delicious meats. Sometimes it almost seems overbearing, how often they come.

Thanks to fellow yelpers and my previous experience at a similar restaurant, we did not have our recommended three servings of leaves here, that's for sure. I quite enjoyed the smoked salmon.<br><br>My weird friend and boyfriend LOVED the caramelized banana side dish. They had a theory that the sourness of the banana helped increase appetite. So whenever the card was flipped to the red (no meat, please) side, they were munching on these bananas. We had 4 dishes I believe and that's 8 bananas in total.

We were late for 6:30 reservations on a Thursday and were seated within 5 minutes, there was a decent amount of people in the place. We ordered Mango Refresco and the Daiquiri for drinks, which were both great, but a unanimous decision ruled the Mango Refresco was the better of the two. The drinks were very slow to come out, for some reason it took over 10 minutes for 2 cocktails. One member of our group ordered a second one and that one too took about 10 minutes to come out. Understandable I guess, it was pretty busy.<br><br>I must mention the service, because it was both really awesome, but kind of confusing at the same time. Our \"server(?)\" who first greeted us when we sat down was nice, and advertised a couple shrimp appetizers not included in the buffet/samplings, which we passed on. We needed a few minutes to look at the drink menu, so she left and said we can help ourselves to the salad bar. After not showing her face for about 10 minutes, another gentleman came by and took our drink order, served us the first round of drinks, and checked back on us a little later. Anyway, the gaucho chefs who run around with the meats were all very professional and accommodating, as well as the bussers. We were very pampered with fresh plates every couple minutes, refilled waters, chairs being pushed in, and as we were leaving I received some surprising (but charming) help with my coat, how nice. The whole green/red flip card is a pretty cool concept, when it's green the chefs all flock to your table like birds. Some of the meats are cooked to a desired temperature, and they did a great job of cutting those temperatures in a expeditious manner. Anyway, our \"server(?)\" only made 2 other appearances, one time to bring the late drink, and another time for the check, which I wanted to split among certain group members, but she insisted on doing it \"evenly\" with several different cards. This was frustrating because some people didn't order $10+ drinks. Not that big of an issue, I suppose I should have made it clear from the beginning how to divide the checks, but ended up just throwing it all on one card.<br><br>Now onto the massive amounts of wonderful consumables...<br>The salad bar was intriguing, and pretty big. I wouldn't say worth $30 for the lunch salad bar alone, but it had a variety of fresh options to make a couple large plates. Lots of cool stuff: fresh arugula, sun dried-tomatoes, fresh mozz balls, and some surprisingly AWESOME prosciutto. There was also some black beans and possibly soup/hot items that I didn't really look at.<br><br>Then there was the MEATS! We all simultaneously flipped our cards to green and were instantly attacked by skewer-wielding gaucho chefs. I won't review all the meats individually, but the ones that stuck out to me after trying just about all of them were the top and bottom sirloins, bacon-wrapped filet, parmesan pork loin and lamb leg. I didn't particularly care for the chicken leg or beef ribs, but to each his own. Its very hard to keep track of the different cuts, let alone remember them and write about them, however, one of the highlights was the crispy edges on one of the sirloins. The smoky (but not burnt) flavor combined with a melt-in-your-mouth texture of the perfectly-cooked and sliced beef was quite memorable.<br><br>Alongside the meats were some sides included with dinner. Mashed potatoes, fried bananas, cheesy bread rolls and polenta French fries. These were all wonderful, the cheesy bread had a really cool foamy texture and the polenta French fries were quite tasty.<br><br>To conclude, we had a lot of fun at Fugo de Chao, and definitely ate as much as we could. Although expensive, I would say that the all-you-can-eat high quality, flavorful meats and large salad bar make it very worth it on occasion.

I can't stress that enough. If you like meat, this is the best place to be. If you don't, the salad bar was delicious. Paying the dinner fee gets you unlimited access to BOTH. The meat is definitely steakhouse quality, and there are so many options that come right to your table as much as you want. It's expensive (about as much as going to any other steakhouse in Chicago) but you get SO MUCH more for your money. Also, the cheese bread that they bring (unlimited) is out of this world!<br><br>THE SERVICE (5 of 5):<br>Service here is great. All the servers are friendly, attentive, and they come by whenever you need anything. Once you flip your card to green, the gaucho chefs come by immediately. And they come in succession so that by the time your card has been green for 5 minutes you've probably had 10 of the 16 meats offered to you already. If you don't want to be bothered or you need a break, flip the card back to red and they stop immediately. Also, if you want to try something specific, you can call over a server and they can have that chef come over to your table. <br><br>THE AMBIANCE (5 of 5):<br>It was pretty packed, but it's a big place with high ceilings so you don't feel too crowded. The first table we got was near the front door, but we asked to move further into the dining room and they accommodated us with no problem. Our new table was right in the middle of the action and close to the salad bar. Great table. Right next to a waterfall wall. <br><br>BOTTOM LINE (5 of 5):<br>While I would only go here for special occasions (you get more for your money but it's still pricey for an average evening), it is easily one of my favorite restaurants and dining experiences I've ever had.

We requested meats and they forgot and didn't come until we had requested it 2 or 3 times. Maybe February 17 is just a bad day for them?

The meat.  Now as I said, I'm not a huge meat eater, but there are so many varieties that unless you're a vegetarian, there will definitely be something there that you'll like.  Granted, if you only like chicken, I probably wouldn't recommend going there (dinner is $50), but if you don't limit yourself to white meat there are quite a few options.  <br><br>And now to what I feel really made the entire experience at Fogo de Chao.  The service.  When we got to our table, our chairs were immediately pulled out for us.  Our water glasses were never empty and our sides and bread were replaced constantly throughout the night.  We never once asked for more water, bread, or sides, but the servers were constantly refilling and replacing them for us.  The servers also came to know our preferences for how we liked our meat cooked - the two I were with like rare/medium rare and I like medium well/well.  Once we had told a few servers that, it was as if all or most of them knew.<br><br>The two things that you should remember when you go - and you should go! - are to go when you're hungry so you get your money's worth and that when you have your chip on green, be prepared for lots of attention from the servers and lots of different options!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Took my girl friend here for our anniversary and it was perfect, very professional and they had a amazing selection of meats!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Fogo de Chao is still the BEST!  My family and I have been making yearly homage to gluttony since 2004.  We are a party of 10+ and our frequency defaults our seating at the same table.<br><br>Best Lamb Chops in town.  The gauchos happily serve as much as they can.<br><br>Excellent Customer Service -- easy to get reservation, showed up WITHOUT reservation once for a party of 10+ and we were still seated, and the staff is always happy to GIVE more meats.<br><br>As the family grows, kids play at the bar area when they get restless.  For a moment, I thought we will be prohibited.  The person who looked like a Manager reminded and cautioned us to keep shoes on in case there is a glass particle from breakage.<br><br>Superbly generous in many ways!  Meat.  Chocolates.  We are happy to pay.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "First time there today, thanks to my boss.<br><br>From the moment we entered and were greeted by the staff, I knew this restaurant would be phenominal.  And I was right.<br><br>I honestly have never seen a salad bar as good as the one here.  You create your own salad and then go bac kto your table to eat it.  The waiters will wait for you to finish dining on your salad, then take your plate for you.  Then, you turn over your \"red card\" on your table and the real fun begins!<br><br>The servers continually roam the room and offer you different types of meats.  I have to say that by the time the fourth server came over, I was already full...full on extremely tasty meats!<br><br>Be sure to save room for dessert.  I had the chocolate mousse cake, and was in true heaven.  From what I hear they also have a killer cheesecake.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Service was nothing short of impeccable.

I took my play daughter who turned 21 that day and my brother's girlfriend who was turning 20 that coming Wednesday.

The selection at the buffet by the way was to die for; the cheese, smoked salmon, the potato salad - of all things! - were phenomenal! At the time we were ready to move on to our next helping of the buffet, the play daughter Kelly got up to go and get our shared agreed food from the buffet. I went to clear her plate and stack it under mine to make room. I was suddenly greeted by a gentleman who cried \"No, no, no you are in my house you cannot do that here\" and made me put the plates down. I began to explain why I was doing it but he stopped me saying \"Ma'am, we apologize it even made it this far. We should have seen that you were finishing and then prepared to clear it away before you even gave it a second thought.\" We were descended upon by multiple servers who cleared the table and brought fresh plates. Kelly returned to the table during this and just looked bewildered at the flurry of activity that was happening. The gentleman looked down at me and asked if there was anything else he could do, adding that he'd heard there was a request at this table. He was able to bring someone over to speak a bit of Portuguese with Kelly, who was all at once astounded, nervous yet quite pleased. The food was delicious, and it seemed like the gauchos knew exactly what kind of meat we wanted. Everyone interacted with us wonderfully, smiled pleasantly, great vibe all around. I loved that there was no music overpowering our conversations. At the end, an employee named Kelly, who ended up being our server, surprised us almost intrinsically with free desserts for the young ladies since it was their birthdays! Destiny, who was the one that is my little brothers girlfriend, got the mousse and I guess white chocolate cake layer cake with, funnily enough, her favorite color of candle. Kelly got a chocolate lava cake, which she had just spoken to her mother about minutes before our dinner.

Given that I ate here just hours ago I am sure they can glance at the schedule. <br><br>Oh yes, the food. Salad bar was superb, everything was as fresh as can be, the mozzarella was probably the best I have had, the prosciutto was lovely, and the salmon was divine. I don't know why I like heart of palm so much but that is fantastic too. Combining meat, cheeses and various greens always leads to a perfect and savory bite. I had to try hard not to eat too much from the \"salad\" bar (Which i could easily make the entire meal and still be ecstatic about my experience) to save room for what must have been the 3 cows I then devoured. Their signature Picanha cut steals the show, if you don't know what cut that is they provide the 411 of all their numerous selections on a handy menu card provided at each table. The decadent supply of meats are so perfectly cooked and seasoned, every bite gives me the Andrew Zimmern have to put the fork down and \"omg\" face. (If you watch any Bizzare Foods episodes, you know what I am talking about). I also have probably the pickiest girlfriend in terms of food, and being that she now ranks this as one of the top 3 dinners she has had in her lifetime really says something about the place. Great wine selection too, I prefer a decent Malbec as it pairs well with all their red meats. Nothing like some Argentine wine with a Brazilian BBQ (ha) You get never ending sides throughout the entire meal and they offer a great break in between stuffing your face with the strong, umptuous flavors from the meat parade. If you want something that hasn't come around yet, worry you not, the wait staff always asks if you need something specific and how you want it cooked, and will send it right on over to you.<br><br>Yes this place is amazing, yes it is worth the money, yes you should go here, and if you have self esteem issues, the service will leave you feeling like a King, albeit a King who now needs a nap due to impending food coma and severe overindulgence. I am good on eating anything for a couple days. Cheers", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "We have always been a fun of fogo de chao and speak so highly of them to family and friends. Last night, pre- Valentine dinner, all of that changed.<br>Our waiter was very nice and accommodating. A certain guy named Paul was extra attentive and nice.

Yelpers seem to rate Fogo as the best of the breed in Chicago and I agree. <br><br>My favorites were the perfect filet mignon, the melt-in-your-mouth lamb chops, and the Parmesan-encrusted pork. I see from their website that the lamb in imported from New Zealand - interesting, because I've only had lamb that good before when it's been from New Zealand at events sponsored by the New Zealand government.

Just plan to say no until you're really convinced the item being offered is exactly what you want. You'll still have way too much meat. I tried maybe six different meats and turned down another seven or eight. If they slice a piece of meat for you that's not cooked the way you want it, they'll unhesitatingly take it back and cut you one more to your liking. And be careful asking for rare - they do know how to bring out really rare meat, the kind people at the table will cover their eyes when they're carving off a piece. <br><br>Service was downright excellent. Not only efficient, but prompt, attentive, and friendly. <br><br>The salad items are good, and so are the desserts. But they're all secondary. This is not fine dining.

You don't win friends with salad. <br><br>Oh sure, sure, it is an impressive bar, and on my first couple of visits I was taken in by the colorful array of vegetables, and tricked myself into thinking that by consuming a salad with this meal I was somehow being \"healthy\" or \"balanced.\" <br><br>There is nothing healthy or balanced about a meal at Fogo de Chao. Furthermore, there is nothing sane about it either. <br><br>The salad bar is full of a wide variety of delicious and impressive ingredients. Visit it if you must, but remember, every bite of spinach takes up space that could be occupied by Parmesan covered pork. <br><br>The bread they offer, on the other hand, is light, bite sized and delicious. And while it has the potential of filling you up on non-meat substances, enjoying one or two will not make too much of an impact on one's gastro-capacity. <br><br>Once you flip your card to green, alerting the hospitable staff of silly-trousered servers to begin bombarding you with delicious meats of all species and temperatures, the real fun begins. They will deliver conservative portions of mashed potatoes, fried polenta, and plantains - all of which are wonderful - but as with all non-meat items, have the potential to rob space from the more valuable meat-items. <br><br>It is incumbent for every patron of Fogo de Chao to please, for the mother of all things sacred, pace yourself. Never have more than three pieces of meat on your plate at once. Do not be afraid to ask a server for a specific item. As a matter of fact, be sure to request specific items, as they will come to you before anyone else when they exit the kitchen, ensuring that the portion you receive is as fresh and hot as can be.<br><br>Be sure to enjoy ample portions of the fillet and chicken breast wrapped in bacon, the Parmesan pork, and the garlic covered beef. Of course, just about everything they offer on the menu is amazing, and I couldn't be more enthusiastic as I write this review. <br><br>I have never had a bad experience at Fogo de Chao, and never had the slightest reason to complain.

Really Fogo de Chao? People come here all the time for endless meat on skewers, but your fish is amazing? Everyone else is just missing out.

Most have good quality meat, good cooks who prepare the meat nicely, and a solid selection with good service. I have found the salad bars to always be lacking. Fogo has a beautiful selection of antipasti style vegetables, a surprisingly impressive selection of above average meats and cheeses, and even some items that may surprise you (not bad sushi *for a Brazzeri). <br><br>Do this ONE  favor to yourself. After going to the salad bar, immediately flip the meat request tool over. For some reason I see a lot of people eat the salad, then order meat. I don't understand why. The meal is designed to be eaten harmoniously. <br><br>Fogo de Chao is a magnificent restaurant that you've likely passed countless times and always been curious about,. It's a little pricey, but they have to cover their end since it's all you can eat.

Salad bar wasn't as good as the one at Brazzaz. They definitely had more variety and not just salads. Although I noticed Brazzaz has more of a variety of meats , the meat at Fogo isn't overly salted and is perfectly seasoned. But Fogo's only downfall is probably the pineapple. And the simply fact that they don't have any. That is the only reason why I took 1 star off. No pineapple, No star!... I'm a greedy Mofo!<br> <br>There's is something that is awfully uplifting after eating pounds of meat, you taste some pineapple.

First thing you should know is that if you're thinking spending over $50 a person, that you'll be surrounded by fine, upstanding, proper folk like yourself, this is not the place for you. I was appalled to see many people wearing ripped jeans and dirty sneakers. During dinner hours, they really should have a dress code. The behavior was on par with the attire; there was a group of people in the lobby encouraging their young children to twerk it whist waiting to be called. The worst part about this place was that you really shouldn't bother making a reservation. We were seated over 40 minutes after our reservation because they lump your reservation in with all the walk ins. We were celebrating an anniversary too. Nothing says romantic like getting sass from the hostess about why you're waiting. She told us they were behind because they ran out of scallops.... they don't have scallops...<br><br>It wasn't all bad though. The food was quite good. While the cocktails are expensive, they are definitely worth it. And the cheese puffs are to die for.<br><br>But it wasn't all roses after we sat down either. It's incredibly loud in the dining room, so again, unless shouting across the table is appealing to you, definitely not a place for a romantic occasion. Several hours after leaving, we both got very sick to our stomachs. We didn't over indulge (didn't get \"meat sweats\", as some yelpers call it), and neither of us have food allergies. It was that kind of sick you get after going to a Chinese buffet, you know, just 5 times more expensive.<br><br>All in all, I will not be going back and recommend you heed my warning.

To begin, don't go to the salad bar. If you do, then only put tiny items on your massive plate. The final plate shouldn't look like comfort food at a buffet; rather, it should look like ultra haute molecular gastronomy.<br><br>2. Don't eat any of the (unsolicited) carbs that they put on the table: polenta is boring, bananas are cheap, and mashed potatoes are ... okay, they are good, but that's not why you went to Fogo de Chao.<br><br>3. If anybody asks if you need anything, tell them that you want the filet mignon to come around. Nothing would be more tragic than spending $50 and getting full before the filet rolls around. Don't leave this to chance; speak up. All of the meats are good, but the filet is just a little better. <br><br>4. Always direct the meat cutter to give you the smallest amount possible. This will make you more likely to try all of the meats. <br><br>Bonus free stuff tip: If you are there for a special occasion (birthday, graduation, engagement, anniversary, etc.), let the waiter know when he or she inquires. At the end they'll bring out a huge piece of chocolate cake. Its not good cake, but you know the old line about sex and pizza: even when its bad its good. <br><br>While nobody should lie about these matters, of course, shyness is not a virtue in this context.

Probably not a lot.<br><br>So here are my tips for a successful experience at Fogo de Chao:<br><br> - Go only if your job is paying, because then you can go all out and you don't have to worry about what I'm sure was an obscene bill, though probably made less obscene because we came for lunch and not dinner - tip: it's the same menu.<br><br> - If you're a single lady and wondering where all the hot guys in Chicago are during a Friday lunch hour, I'm here to tell you they're not at a bar. They're at Fogo getting their meat on. Hot guys + meat = win!<br><br> - If you're with a large group, don't sit in the far corner, as this will decrease your champagne refills and thus consumption by approximately 75%.<br><br> - I liked our server, except she kept refilling other people's champagne glasses who weren't even drinking it and wasn't refilling mine and I WAS drinking it. Don't stand between me and my bubbles, lady.<br><br> - They really need one of those red/green circles for booze. Mine would have been GREEN.<br><br> - The salad bar is no joke. Load up on salad and veggies, but do not eat them all at once. I will come back to this.<br><br> - Do not attempt to run out with the bowl of bacon on the salad bar, even though you will want to. Act like a lady.<br><br> - You will be overwhelmed by all the meat coming at you. Don't be. It's a good thing.<br><br> - For the love of god, get the filet mignon. It will literally melt in your mouth and you will look back on that moment fondly for weeks to come.<br><br> - The bacon wrapped filet mignon is also a gift from heaven, but takes 2nd place for me.<br><br> - I did not enjoy the bacon wrapped chicken as much as I thought I would.<br><br> - The sausage is good for one bite and that's it.<br><br> - You will lose track of the rest of the meat you ate, but that's okay.<br><br> - The mashed potatoes are good, but do not waste time on carbs.<br><br> - Those little rolls are also good and somehow not filling at all.<br><br> - If you are like me and have dramatically cut back your red meat consumption and fear what a trip to Fogo de Chao will do to your digestive system, here's my tip: upon returning from the salad bar, eat a small portion of salad. Then, for every two bites of meat you must eat one to two bites of veggies. Your digestive system will thank you, and you will thank yourself later for your brilliant idea. <br><br> - If the thought of dessert makes you want to vomit, get it anyway. The creme brulee is the perfect way to end your meal and prepare your body for the nap it will be taking later.<br><br> - Eat a bite of the chocolate molten cake and not one bite more.<br><br> - When you get home, immediately wash the meat glow from your face. You will feel a thousand times better.<br><br> - When laying on your couch in a meat coma, do not laugh at your friend who kindly asks you out to dinner. It is not nice and your friend may not appreciate it.<br><br> - You will likely not be hungry again for 24+ hours, so don't plan on any other meals before then.<br><br>Now go forth and eat meat.

She told me that someone told her that eating at Fogo de Chao should be on everyone's \"bucket list.\" It was never on mine, but I quickly added it and crossed it off. <br><br>The best thing about this joint is not only the food, but the tremendous service as well. As soon as we walked in, we were fairly greeted and escorted to our seats. The host (Pool) introduced himself as well as how the restaurant works; it was either kind of loud or we're just plain deaf because we had a hard time hearing the guy. The lowest level our water got was 80% full, the water guy just kept filling and filling. <br><br>The first thing we tried was actually the Pao de Queijo (warm cheese bread) the bussers placed on the table. Our first round was real fresh because we saw the smoke coming out of the bread. The bread was real soft and the cheese really complemented it. So we went on ahead and headed to the all-you-can-eat salad bar and enjoyed ourselves some appetizers. I got myself additional bread, Jumbo Asparagus, some sort of raisin salad, bacon, Italian Salami, as well as some salsa, which were all fairly good, especially the salsa. The cheese display was also magnificent. <br><br>After the appetizers, we turned our \"red stop\" card to the \"green go\" side and as soon as we did that, 2 plates were placed on our table and the gaucho chefs swarmed to us like killer bees with sharp knives. <br><br>The first meat we tried was the Picanha, which is the prime part of the sirloin that is seasoned with sea salt (or flavored with garlic). With this meat, you could really taste the sea salt, really good. We also tried the Filet Mignon, Beef Ancho, Frango (Chicken wrapped with bacon), Fraldinha (bottom sirloin), Alcatra (top sirloin). In my unpaid opinion, all the meats were cooked to perfection; I really liked the Frango as well as the Filter Mignon due to the taste of seasoning and the texture of the meats. Steak sauce or other sauces are only not a necessity due to the packed flavors the meats already bring to the table. <br><br>Side dishes such as Crispy Hot Palenta, Garlic Mashed Potatoes, and Caramelized Bananas (or what my people call Banana Q) also came to our table. The palenta and potatoes were decent but I truly enjoyed the plantain bananas due to its sweetness. <br><br>Finally, when we finished, one of the servers brought in a five-layered molten chocolate cake (with strawberry) for my birthday, which was great by the way. I was chocolate wasted after I ate it. <br><br>Overall, I had a decent experience, and I only claim decent because I wasn't fully prepared for the experience. I gave a five out of five rating due to the excellent customer service and of course, the quality and the taste of the meats. I found it unique that all the workers have a little scraper that they use whenever there are scraps left on the table. <br><br>You can't really try all the meats, drinks, deserts, side dishes, and appetizers in one sit-in (unless you really try). For a price of about $60 per person, you should be able to. One of my regrets is as mentioned above; I didn't get to try all the meats. I never came across the Cordeiro (lamb), Costelo de Porco (pork ribs), Linquica (sausage), as well as the Brazilian flan. <br><br>My other one biggest regret could have answered my complaint when I was eating....\"Where is the rice?\" Being a person who eats rice on a daily basis, I kept complaining that what these fine meats are missing is my favorite daily food complement. However, unbeknownst to me, rice was available and that I never got to request it. But then again, life's too short for regrets and there's always a next time, now I just got to wait for a special occasion to come along. <br><br>You definitely should not eat before you come here.

They did a $35 dinner, which seems much more reasonably priced. We thought it was good, but everyone raves about Fogo so we had to try it.<br><br>We made a reservation but still had to wait about a half hour. First strike. They directed us to the bar, which was similarly crowded. We couldn't sit down, but one of the waiters still offered us a bread basket, which was nice, but were we supposed to hold it in our hands along with our drinks? Also, I sent by boy to the crowded front of the bar to order drinks with a request for a mojito. The bartender basically pushed him into ordering 2 caprihinhas, mostly it seemed because they had those pre-mixed, so when dealing with a ton of people I guess they try to push this \"signature\" drink.

People were on dates wearing suits and dresses, families were out for a nice meal in jeans and sweaters, and thuggy looking guys rolled in with backward caps and baggy pants. All were welcome.<br><br>Food: The meal comes in two parts. First is the salad bar portion full of cold salads, breads, and cheeses. The second is the meat portion which comes with warm sides of polenta, rolls, mashed potatoes, and plantains. All are all you can eat.<br><br>The salad bar is on the higher end with its various offerings. Greens, veggies, cheeses, and a few deli sliced meats are all accounted for. My advice is not to fill up too much on the first trip. It will be there for you later and filling up on potato salad and heavy cheeses may make your stomach wary of the meat cornucopia that awaits you. But don't forget the veggies. It became a nice break for me to grab another plate of fresh greens later when the carbs and meat were in full force. It was odd though that nothing in the salad bar was labled nor was there an employee to help me figure out what items were what. <br><br>The abundance of meat is obviously the reason to come here. Various cuts cooked to your liking with no end in sight. The highlights were the filet, the bacon wrapped filet, and the chicken. I did notice throughout the evening though that not all the meats tasted like they were seasoned.

Many times we were checked up on and it was a different person almost every time. The water glass is never empty and the side dishes are refilled without any asking. My wife mentioned to one employee she was a vegetarian and wouldn't be needing a plate for meat and a couple minutes later a different employee approached her offering grilled vegtables. Even when we recieved the bill and noticed a wrong charge on it we were given a delicious complimentary dessert because of the minor error.

The hostess told me I was set for the appointment but she wrote my name on the clipboard wrong so not sure how that could happen if my information was in the system. She kept giving excuse after excuse why we were not seated. Then when we sat down we were surrounded by three large long tables of people who came in a group. It was very loud. The servers would float around the big group tables more and we were even skipped. A couple next to use would get served while we would not. We got served our meat first before the potatoes, plantains, drinks, etc. Then when we got served one serving of meat it took about 10 minutes to be served again. Within 45 mins we were only seen about four times by anyone when it came to the meat. I did come here about 7 years ago in the daytime and did not have this problem but I guess if you are not in a group then you do not serve much of a purpose.

Dinner was a vibrant, lively, and of course busier affair.<br><br>Service overall was excellent and on point compared to other Brazilian steakhouses I've been to. When you have that green card up, you can expect someone to be there to serve you a cut of meat pretty quickly. When I mentioned the slower paced nature of lunch, I meant it as a much more relaxed environment for the servers and waiters. During dinner they are sometimes frantically running around - which is understandable when you have a packed house. That frantic pace can be a \"cold\" experience to some diners though. However, during lunch the servers and waiters are much more relaxed, not rushed, personable, and even funny. So the lunch experience was of course comforting and warm. Don't get me wrong, dinner service is excellent.<br><br>Lastly, the food. Ah the food...simply heaven. The choices of meat aren't too exotic but they definitely have a very good selection. For me, I loved all the red meats. I think my favorite was the picanha...or was it the ancho?..maybe the alcatra? Lamb? Ok, so I loved them all. Everything was cooked to near perfection. My least favorite was the pork loin with Parmesan cheese, but my gal pal loved that one. So I guess as long as you like meat you should find something you like here.

The restaurant itself is supposed to offer a variety of meats and an uncommonly large salad bar, where everything tastes so delicious and juicy!<br><br>When first getting there the hostess quickly seated us which I thought was amazing for such a well known restaurant in the city of Chicago. After being seated and rapidly greeted by our waiter Marco, I felt a sense of comfortability immediately. Having him check on us, close to every 8 minutes, I thought was top notch service for such a high end restaurant with so many people sitting down beside us. Definitely the kind of service I would want going to a nice restaurant.<br><br>When first arriving to the salad bar, the first thing I couldn't help but notice was the presentation of the large table itself and the beautiful extravagant colors. The large variety of meat, cheese, olives, and pasta drove me wild and hungry as ever! The aroma that came from the table was a mixture of deliciousness and made my mouth water from the salt and sweet flavors. After the salad bar was over multiple waiters walked around with different cuts and varieties of meats and chicken. Whether it was the parmesan crusted chicken or the filet mignon wrapped in bacon and lightly seasoned, the flavors all were absolutely outstanding and I have yet to not crave it when thinking of food.<br><br>Overall I would definitely have to recommend this restaurant. The attitude I left with was a happy feeling and left with my stomach feeling full as ever! If I would share my thoughts on a Brazilian restaurant in the city of Chicago I would highly recommend Fogo De Chao for the overall best experience.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "On a beautiful sunny day last summer, Mr. N and I got married! Later that day, our families and guests all met at Fogo de Chao to indulge in a meat feast, because, let's be honest, could there be a better way to celebrate the union on the two biggest fat kids in the world? I think not. We'd been to eat here at lunch a few months before, just to see what it was like. Lunch there is great, for those who would rather fork over 30 dollars (as opposed to 50). We talked to a manager and made reservations for our party of 30 (small weddings RULE). Easy peasy!<br><br>On the night, we had to wait a little for our tables, but it was a Saturday and the place was PACKED. We got to sit next to the big mural in the back room, which was beautiful. The service here is impeccable. Our server, Marcus was really patient and nice. It seems pretty hard to explain the concept to a big group of people who had never been there and were talking amongst themselves. He was so attentive and brought us a flan with \"Congratulations\" written on the plate for us. <br><br>As for the food, what else can be said? Filet mignon wrapped in bacon! Parmesan pork! Lamb chops! What a dream! Our vegetarian friends were happy too. The salad bar is fantastic. Every time I eat there, I pile so many marinated mushrooms on my place.

I finally had an excuse to go when a friend came into town this past weekend.<br><br>OH LORD! I love Fogo de Chao. I love ALL Brazilian steakhouses, but I think this one (the location in Chicago is the home of my first Brazilian steakhouse experience EVER, that fateful day two and a half years ago) is still my favorite. The variety is not as good as Brazzaz, but the superior quality makes up for that.<br><br>I feel I must once again categorize my Brazilian steakhouse review:<br><br>THE SALAD BAR: Not as many options as Brazzaz, but overall better quality. From the tomatoes/buffalo mozzarella to the broccoli and asparagus to the potato salad, everything is just a little bit tastier. I will say, though, that Brazzaz still has the World's Best Chicken Salad. But the chicken salad at Fogo kicks butt, too! If you're like my boyfriend and you prefer a lot of crazy stuff like sushi, raw oysters, and tortellini, you'll like Brazzaz better. But I appreciate the fact that Fogo does their fewer offerings BETTER.<br><br>THE MEAT: Same deal as the salad bar... not quite as much is offered, but it's better. Don't get me wrong, the meat at Brazzaz is still superb, but the meat at Fogo is just a little tastier. They have most of the same cuts of beef, most of the same chicken/lamb/pork offerings, but they don't have everything Brazzaz brings around, like shrimp and pineapple. Again, it all depends on what you're looking for -- I'd rather have fewer options that taste better, but my boyfriend really missed the shrimp.<br><br>THE SIDE DISHES: I don't see any major differences between the polenta, mashed potatoes, and fried bananas. yum, yum, and yum at both restaurants. The bananas are less \"fried\" here than at Brazzaz. But the bread, ohhhh the bread. I am dangerously addicted to the cheese bread, and the Fogo bread is just BETTER than Brazzaz. Plus, it's always hot, and they fill it up so many times... heavenly. Embarrassingly enough, I ate 16 of those little things this weekend.

Hold back on everything. Switch your \"chip\" to the meat and have your first bite be either the garlic picanha or the lamb chop. Incredible. Normally, I prefer thick cut ribeye, but at Fogo the thinly sliced sirloin picanha is amazing. Tied with first place, the lamb rib chops are some of the best I've ever had anywhere - slightly charred on the outside, juicy on the inside. The filet mignon (with or without bacon) comes in second, and then the beef ribs, which were velvety soft and sliced off the bone for easy eating. You have to ask for the beef ribs specially, I am not sure why. The other sirloin cuts were good - the t boned lamb chop was ok. Don't bother with the chicken and my friends found the pork to be only so-so. Ask for a few of the sauces, not that the meat really needs it. What is amazing is how different each cut of beef tastes. The marinades are subtle, the grilling is perfect and so is the carving of the beef.<br><br>After the first round or two of beef, take a break and enjoy the fried bananas and polenta. The cheese biscuits were so-so and the mashed potatoes were disappointing. The salad bars did not have any of the seafood dishes associated with Brazilian steakhouses. But there was potato salad. Potato salad?? I don't think so. I took some arugula and hearts of palm with some dressing as a palate cleanser. The dressing was a bit heavy. There are some heavy or strongly flavored dishes at the salad bar - all the more reason to save it for after the meat.<br><br>The service was good - but perhaps a bit over-enthusiastic.

I was so excited to go and I had been bragging about this place for months until we finally went. As we walked in, we noticed the restaurant was elegant and clean. A nice place to be. They served us a basket of bread with cheese in it that you can barely taste. So we then headed towards the salad bar and I started to look for the soup which they didn't have any, unlike Texas De Brazil. Then we made our way to the salad bar and started to add to our plates. The salad bar was pretty good. The potato salad and chicken salad were good but you can get that just about anywhere. It wasn't that special to be honest. They had regular Caesar salad and garden salad with only about 6 dressings to choose from. They also had some pasta salad which was also good but not the best. They had salami and a variety of cheeses that also did not have much taste. All these things I could honestly find at jewel that have a better taste but the salad bar is not what got me worked up, it was the meat they were serving. After flipping our car over from red to green, we had different waiters coming over to serve us meat. The first one was filet mignon and I asked for a medium well piece, however it tasted so dry. Then I received a piece of lamb and also I asked for medium well and this piece was burned and had fat on it. When I asked the waiter for a different piece he made some remark about if the meat is burned you won't gain much weight or something of the like which was rather rude. Then i noticed that after an hour of being there, nobody came to serve us ribs or sausage and probably a few other meat as well. I had to ask the gentleman walking by. After he sent over these types of meats, they mentioned that both were made out of pork which is not my favorite but I still tried them. That was honestly my first mistake was trying them. The meat was white colored and I have never seen ribs colored white, I was very disgusted and the majority of the meat they were serving were all over salted I couldn't even taste the flavor. When I asked the waiter to please take my plate away, he looked at me with an attitude look and asked what was wrong with it as if I was not paying for my plate. It should have been free tasting the way it did. I've had better experiences at regular $7 buffets than this over costly restaurant that has nothing to brag about. The majority of the waiters would flash a smile and the minute they turned, they would have an annoyed look. The waiter even charged us for a bottle of sprite which we never even ordered. All we had was water. I honestly enjoyed Texas De Brazil a million times more. If you want really good Brazilian food, please don't waste your time or money on this place. It was a waste of everything. In the end, it even hurt my stomache that I felt the need to throw up.

But seriously folks, this is a meat eaters paradise and if you or someone in your party can't accept that fact, steer (get it steer, as in cow?) clear of this place, or at the very least throw them towards the top notch salad bar. Between the meat and the salad bar, if someone can't find something to eat, then they deserve to starve.<br><br>Typically I eat there about once every six months and have been doing so for the past several years. For starters, Fogo is no longer the only all you can eat meat place in town, but from my experience at other the other places, they still have the best selection of meats to choose from. However, sometimes I question whether the quality of the meat has gone down. At times the meat doesn't seem as tender or juicy as it used to be. I do like the way they salt and spice it though and this has not changed, but taste can only hide so much for inferior texture. But given the price to portions eaten, I can't complain. It is expensive, but worth it after several rounds of meat.<br><br>Service: An example of quality teamwork and service in motion...that is once you manage to get seated. Even with reservations, I have seen walk-ins seated faster than complete parties waiting for a table, and have experienced this myself. I think they do that so they can steer larger parties towards the bar so they can order more drinks.<br><br>Regarding wait times one time my friend could no longer take it- we had reservations, were early, and had to wait, while walk-ins of the same number of people were seated. She gave the host staff a piece or her mind and we were promptly seated with an apology soon after. Whether intentional or not, if you have reservations, and YOUR PARTY IS ON TIME, keep track of the wait, and be persistent towards the host/hostess if it runs past a reasonable amount of time. And stay away from the bar, you'll easily run up a tab from the very efficient staff.<br><br>Once seated, you know the routine, green for 'Feed Me', red for 'I'm Digesting.'  There are several floor staffers that assist in clearing tables and inquiring about your experience. Here is where the service excels. If you have a favorite selection, need a drink, have a question about the meat, need a sauce, or side dish, ask. Usually they will go out of their way to find what you want. If it's not busy, they may even be able to customize an item to your party's request.<br><br>A word of advice- soda is served from single serve bottles. There are no free refills. Keep this in mind if you want a soda.<br><br>Pros: A wide selection of meat, regardless of the source or style selected. A salad bar that will redefine your concept of rabbit food. Eat at your own pace. Great service once seated- staff will go out of their way within reason.<br><br>Cons: Reservation times are a guide to when you might be seated. Meat quality has gone down. All you can eat meat concept may not be for everyone. Drinks, any drinks, are expensive. An inverse relationship between your the size of your wallet and the size your waistline will occur if you eat here too often.<br><br>I would've rated Fogo four stars, but the lack of proper service at the door on multiple occasions knocks the rating down a star.<br><br>To sum it up: Any place that wraps an already tasty piece of meat with a tasty piece of bacon should be not be tried, but experienced.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Fogo De Chao is the best place to go if you love meet.

Plus it's my birthday. So I'm going to indulge myself with my friend and his cousin on a buffet of finely grilled meats. And the feasting was delicious.<br><br>With a reservation for 3 on a Tuesday night, there was no wait. The servers politely explained the process, and offered drinks. I was interested in their Brazillian soda similar to a ginger ale, but they were out! With profuse apologies, they offered a sparkling limeade which I thought had a hint of mint. Absolutely delicious, I think I had at least 4-5 cups of it throughout the night. While still keeping room for the main course of course!<br><br>After starting with a light \"salad\" (the only green thing on my plate was a piece of asparagus) let the festivities begin! Here are my thoughts on a various cuts of meat:<br>Picanha - My absolutely favorite. Delicious and flavorful beyond belief. Juicy and tender cuts of meat seasoned lightly but bursting with flavor. I had at least 4-5 generous slices of this cut.<br>Filet Mignon - This was the first time I've ever had a filet, and I had maybe three 6-oz chunks of it. It was delicious and tender, but not as tender as I had expected. Nevertheless it was good, as well as the extra bacon wrapped piece I had. The bacon added a nice crunch and saltiness that can't be described.<br>Beef Ancho - This was a beautiful cut of rib-eye, swirling lines, juicy and tender. Great flavor, the meat really shines.<br>Alcatra - We kept shooing away the top sirloin (I mean, there are so many other wonderful cuts of meat going around) but I had to try it in the end. It had a delicious burn on the outside, and the meat was tender. Really, was I expecting a bad cut of meat at Fogo?<br>Fraldinha - This piece of bottom sirloin was absolutely divine. It was extremely juicy, fatty goodness.<br>Costela - Yes, while my dining companions were blissfully full, I continued my dining experience with these wonderful dry beef ribs. They fall off the bone, was a bit dryer than expected. Quite a contrast to the juicy and tender meats previously experienced.<br>Cordeiro - The lamb here was quite delicious as well, I had possibly my first lamb chop. Not a bad selection, but not too spectacular either.<br>Frango - Bacon wrapped chicken breasts. The chicken was a bit dry for my liking. Never did try the chicken legs, but it didn't seem too exciting.<br>Linguica - Pork sausage. Deliciously spiced, it's a favorite of my friend's cousin. I liked it, but it was a bit on the salty side for me.<br>What an amazing churrascaria experience!<br><br>I'm so glad they didn't embarrass me because it was my birthday. They simply quietly brought out a complementary chocolate cake with a candle in a slice of strawberry, not singing, dancing, or any of those shenanigans. I'm perfectly fine with that!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I love this place, not only because of the meat.<br><br>The salad bar is amazing.  I think I could eat it only for dinner!  It has no iceberg lettuce, but is filled with seafood, pasta salads, fruit, vegetables...

I'm still thinking about this place a week after going...mmmm tasty!<br><br>I went for a Thursday lunch after reading up on Yelp that it was about the same as dinner, and yup good call everyone! \"A\" had gone there for dinner maybe a week earlier and couldn't see any real difference btw lunch and dinner other than the cost ($32.50 vs $50). Lunch was also less busy and it was nice to have the place not packed with people.<br><br>The decor was nice and the service was great. I got plain ice water and no drinks..cuz I'm here for the meat. I had to prove myself, \"A\" didn't think I could eat my $$$s worth, and I was up to the challenge. <br><br>I know EVERYONE says skip the salad bar, but I'm not one of those people who can sit and eat solid meat for 2 hrs. So I went and took a gander- nice spread. I skipped the mayo-ey looking stuff and went for some veggies and the mozzarella balls. The asparagus spears were huge but the bottoms were stringy, I liked the moz ball, red bell peppers and for some reason the beets. Skip the prosciutto and the smoked salmon, because once you get a nice juicy piece of meat...these kinda pale in comparison.<br><br>So I sat down and began the meat adventure...*voom* 5 in a row came by and soon I had more meat than I knew what to do with in less than 10 min. I quickly flipped back to red. After a while, a waiter came over to ask if there was a problem...I guess he thought I'd put up my white flag too soon. But, really I don't think you should get more than perhaps 3 pieces of meat at a time. They get cold and really they taste best hot. By the time I got to my last piece it was pretty cold. So I think a good tip would be to pace yourself and flip that card back and forth a few times. You're not a quitter, you're a strategic pacer!<br><br>I esp enjoyed the rib-eye, filet mignon, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, and there was some sirloin I thought was mighty tasty. I wasn't too impressed by the lamb chop and the rib...maybe it was just my pieces but they were a tad dry. \"A\"s ribs were very good..maybe mine was just a dry end piece. Also for the pieces of meat you eh-ishly wanna try..get one piece and split...see if itz worth you're stomach space and keep tabs on the ones you like. <br><br>Another great thing about pacing, is that they'll come around (probably wondering why the crazy lady has it on red) and ask you if there is a specific meat you want to try and they will send just that guy over. So I got rib-eye and filet mignon sent over again =). Nice, not have to wait for them to make the rounds again. <br><br>The sides they brought to the table were mashed potatoes, fried polenta, bananas and lil cheese bread puffs. I love mashed potatoes, but I didn't like the ones here. Tasted a bit like the boxed powdered stuff...if I were them, I'd work on the recipe and make them AWESOME mashed potatoes and see if I could entice ppl to fill up on that. The polenta was cold and forgettable. Cheese puffs were ok..but not enough for me to give up my prime stomach real estate. The bananas did me in. I went nuts on those...and every time I got down to 1/2 a banana they'd switch out the plate so I'd get more fresh hot bananas...*drool*, they were a great complement to the meat.<br><br>So...2 hrs later and I'm still chugging along as \"A\" stares in wonder. The turtle has won this round. So take a nice day off, meander over for lunch and make the most of the awesome food. I enjoyed myself SO much I was tempted to talk \"A\" into going back in a day or two, since I was only in town for a few days...but thought that'd be WAY too gluttonous...*sniffle* I miss you...FDC, please come to the Bay Area.<br><br>We walked away stuffed, but not feeling totally crappy.

Finally I came across the clip where ONE OF THEIR WORKERS TOOK THE IPHONE. Unfortunately, the camera did not let us zoom in for us to physically show the iPhone, but it did show the worker bend down TWICE. The manager was furious at US and started going off how he probably bent down to pick up a napkin. Yes the first time he bent down, he picked up a napkin. Then he saw the iPhone lying there and bent down again to pick it up. He picked it up very closely to our chairs and we had no clue he was even behind us. The manager and security kept denying what was physically shown on the tape. We had to file a police report to have this further investigated, but I cannot believe the rudeness the manager and security guard had.

If you truly love red meat and haven't been to a Brazilian steakhouse, you've got  to try one. <br><br>Positive: The filet mignon is to die for! And then the filet mignon wrapped in bacon was even better! The service is outstanding. The guys (gauchos) serving the charred and seasoned meat have cuts ranging from medium rare to well done. If the cut of meat you want isn't available on that skewer, they'll get it for you. If you want your steak (on the stick) cooked longer, just ask! The chicken was surprisingly great too. They have 15 different cuts of meat. The ribs are OK. The pork and lamb are above average. The top and bottom sirloin is tasty. The pichanha (steak) is very good, but the filet is where it's at! The cheese rolls that come with dinner are very good.<br><br>Negative: It's pricey. $48.50 for dinner. Granted, it's all you can eat and that's how much Brazilian steakhouses usually charge, but it's still pricey. The salad bar, while VERY fresh didn't have a very large array of choices. I understand that the meat is why you go there, so overall, it's fine. The parmesan covered pork has way too much cheese on it. There's no seafood. I hear some of Fogo De Chao's competitors serve shrimp. That would've been a nice touch. The fried bananas, polenta and mashed potatoes are good, but not really the point of going here.<br><br>A couple of tips:<br>1. This is all you can eat, very tasty meat so prepare for your visit. You may not want to eat too much earlier in the day if you are having dinner there. I saw people looking very sleepy and others, well, they looked like they didn't feel well. It's not Fogo De Chao's fault. You've got to have stomach room.<br><br>2. While the salad bar is nice, do you want to pay $48.50 for fresh salad? Save your stomach room for the meat show! <br><br>3. Please pace yourself. Your stomach will thank you. They give you a coaster-looking object that is green (please bring me meat now) on one side and red (I'm taking a break) on the other. I recommend not having more than two or three meats maximum on your plate at one time. They'll get cold if you exceed that limit.<br><br>4. Experiment a little. Don't order lamb much? Try it here. Usually like your meat medium well, try different cuts at medium and you may like them better. Since it's all you can eat and you can just get smaller cuts  on your plate, you can afford to experiment and have fun!<br><br>5. While I've heard they have a great mojito-type drink, beyond having that, you may want to limit your drinking. You'll already probably be sleepy from eating all of that meat plus now you want to add lots of alcohol? Hmmm. It's up to you.<br><br>6. Allow plenty of time. At least two hours minimum. You don't want to rush through all of the delightful food and sights. We were there for almost three hours and had a ball.<br><br>7. You may not want to bring anyone who doesn't really like meat. Besides vegetarians, even people who aren't big on red meat will probably be frustrated.<br><br>8.

You have the option to get the salad bar alone for $25 or $30 and honestly that could be enough for a lot of people.  It has sliced meats, any veggie you could want,exotic cheeses,fresh bread,and probably the nicest tomatoes I've ever seen (they must genetically engineer them or something)I go there for the meat orgy ,it is presented in huge chunks on a sword. The Gauchos carve it off to your ordered doneness. then they move on to make way for the next gaucho with the next hunk of meat. At any given time they have at least a dozen different meats , from Top sirloin to fillet , sausage , bacon wrapped chicken,bottom sirloin (my favorite), pork ribs,beef rib meat,and lamb roasts and chops. If you like 1 kind you can load up on that , but I like to get a bit of everything ... OK, a lot of everything. With your meat, you get sides of fried polenta, mashed potato's, and little cheese filled rolls. To say service is good here would be a gross understatement, It is one of the best , if not the best places I've ever been for service. The server literally changed out our rolls if they sat there for more than 4 or 5 minutes.

The desert menu seemed diverse , but I usually order the Creme Brulee. I can say it is the best I've had ,although I've only had bad creme brulee once. You will drop some serious coin here , last time I was there It was $60 per for the meat and salad , if you drink , prepare accordingly for downtown booze prices. I can't afford to eat here as often as I would like to ,but for a special occasion , it is my go to place if anyone wants to make me happy (and also see me in meat coma).", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "the finale and highlight of a my trip to chicago. i dont claim to be an expert on brazillian bbq, but ive been to a few other places and none of them even comes close to the magic that is fogo de chao. being in chicago, most locals might not appreciate the quality of the food served. being from a place where a they dare call a slab of tofu a burger, i was in heaven. i tried 12 of the 13 cuts, sevral of them multiple times. leave me alone, im a pig i know. i dont think theyve ever seen a 5' 6\", SKINNY asian male eat so much. the gauchos seemed just as impressed with my digestive abilities as i was with their food. unfortunately, i dont visit chicago enough, thankfully they have a fogo de chao in southern california, not TOO far from me, i guess.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Mmmmm, such good food!!  IT never stops here.  At first I was thinking \"wow, it takes forever before they come around with the meat\"  I was eating each piece they gave me before they brought over more and then waiting, because they give you a small slice off of the large metal-rotisserie-thing-a-ma-bob at a time.  It just starts out like that, but then it gets better and next thing you know, you're racing against the servers and trying to finish before they bring you more, but nope... it's just too much!  You have to turn your coaster over to the red side for a break.  You get a coaster and when it's on the green side the servers come around with more meat, but when its on red, they leave you alone.    It was a very cool atmosphere and the food was delicious!  The salad bar was HUGE and it looked good, but I didn't come for salad, so I laid off.  My favorite was the chicken wrapped in bacon!

My friend and I went here last night and it was just an all around good experience. First of all, we were an hour late due to traffic and they still held our table for us. They had one of the most amazing salad bars I have ever seen. I wish I had one of those bottomless stomachs, because I would have loved to have tried everything on it. There was everything from veggies, to fresh cheeses, to pasta salads. My friend warned me though that was nothing compared to what was next and that I should go light with the salad.  You are then given this card, red means stop green means bring it on!! I must warn you though, when you do decide to turn your card to green, be prepared to be swarmed. I mean it was seriously like a contest to see how fast you could flip your card back to red before they would stop coming over. There were several selections of meat. I would have to say that my favorite was the parmesan crusted pork. Our waiter was very attentive. My water glass never went empty. The manager also was over to check on us a few times. At one point he asked us if there was anything we hadn't tried yet and we said pork. Within a minute we had 5 different servers at our table with different types of pork. It was crazy. Some people would say it is a lot of money, but $50 for all you can eat, really isn't that bad considering what you are eating. Obviously, I highly recommend this place.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This place is the bomb!!!! (can you still say that?)

We did see the pork sausage guy quite a bit in contrast.  We saw people would wave him away presumably waiting for the better stuff. Poor pork sausage guy.. all dejected. So theres that.

Last night was the first time I went to fogo de chao. I have heard amazing things, but until last night, I did not get to delve into all the goodness.

We met for a friend's birthday and made a reservation for 8 people. When we arrived at 7:30pm for our reservation, our table was ready. It was one large table in an open space and it was perfect. Often, when we reserve seats for a large group, restaurants put several tables together and it is in a crowded spot. The salad was delicious! Lots of great choices, but while the girls were eating their salads, the men began eating the meat, so of course we got jealous and ditched the salad plates. Everything was so delicious, amazing seasoning, great choice of meat cuts. I liked the bottom sirloin the best. I found some of the cuts to be a little fatty, but there at 16 total choices, so I definitely had a lot to choose from. The service was AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING. Bill was pricey, but we knew what we were getting into. As a couple, two dinners, 2 cocktails, 3 beers = 167.00. I believe they have the same selection available for lunch at a cheaper price, that may be the way to go. At the end of the night, our car was even warmed up for us first.
