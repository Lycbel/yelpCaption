I was in Chicago for a few days for a conference, and knew I had to try something in the Stephanie Izard empire. I had a long break Sunday morning, so I opted for a 10:00 reservation for one at the counter.<br><br>Id highly recommend making a reservation, because even the counter space filled up quickly. I couldn't decide what to order (shocking), so I went with the special. I can't remember what it was called, but it was essentially a Cobb salad on top of two pieces of avocado toast with fried egg and fried chicken. I also had coffee and a mimosa.<br><br>Sitting at the counter, I had the pleasure (or agony) of seeing almost all the orders ready at the window. EVERYTHING looked and smelled devine. I saw lots and lots of waffles with fresh strawberries and fried chicken.<br><br>My meal was fresh and filling. My favorite part of the whole dish was the friend chicken! Service was pretty good, given how busy they were, and atmosphere was lively and fun.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The reviews for Little Goat are so glowing that it perhaps is dangerously hyped. This isn't a place for someone who isn't at least a little adventurous when it comes to food. Most of their offerings are very unique twists on classic dishes - the sort of thing that makes you think \"I can't tell if those two things would be good together or not\") although, clearly, most of the time it works out well.<br><br>First of all, I 100000% recommend getting a reservation. Boyfriend and I almost chose to wing it, but the night before made the decision to play it safe and place a last-minute reservation online for 1:30pm. When we arrived the next day we overhead that a wait for a two was nearly two hours. NO FOOD on Earth is worth waiting that long for.<br><br>We shared the This Little Piggy Went to China and the Crispy Creole Chicken Sammie. This Little Piggy had a very interesting glaze, but the biscuit and sausage were delicious and all the flavors worked very well together. The Creole Sammie was also delicious, but is really just a glorified fried chicken burger. The chicken tasted fresh and the bread was toasted perfectly. The portions for both of our dishes was not big, but not small. You're sort of paying for the name and experience so it's pricey (about $13-20 for most main dishes) but it's not completely unreasonable. We also tried the Little Goat Latte which was good, but a bit too sweet and probably not something I'd order again for $5.<br><br>In summary - very good, but not OMG good.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Chef Stephanie Izard of the critically acclaimed Girl & The Goat takes the casual American diner and elevates it to new heights with impeccable cooking and imaginative twists.<br><br>The menu features classic diner dishes, sandwiches, salads, burgers, and adds Asian inspired flavors and dishes. Some recommendations are the Everything is Everything Crumpets, This Little Piggy Went to China, Bull's Eye French Toast, and the Shrimp & Pork Belly Noodles.<br><br>The French toast has eggs, crispy chicken, BBQ maple syrup and strawberries over some sweet onion brioche. The twist is that the toast has been cored out to leave a hole in which the eggs reside.<br><br>The shrimp & pork belly noodles have fideos noodles, which is a Spanish noodle similar to a spaghetti or angel hair pasta. You get chunks of crispy pork belly, large grilled shrimp, veggies, all tossed in a tamarind vinaigrette. The tamarind is very potent, but not overpowering. The pork belly is crispy and tender, and the shrimp is excellent. The noodles are a bit past al dente, but not soggy.<br><br>This Little Piggy Went to China is a sesame cheddar biscuit topped with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and some gooseberries. The biscuit is light and flaky, and the pork sausage is flavorful and tender.<br><br>The Everything is Everything Crumpets is a fried egg salad with slices of smoked salmon, pickles and a tzatziki cream cheese. The salmon is fresh and everything else works nicely to complement it.<br><br>Some recommended sides are the hash browns, bacon and hot crab dip. The hash browns are extra long, stringy and crispy. The crab dip has a bit too much cheese and not enough crackers, but you can always ask for more. The bacon is thick cut with a slightly sweet glaze on top.<br><br>There's also a bakery for some delicious baked goods, coffee, gifts and apparel. Service is quick, friendly and efficient, although it can be hard to track down a server if you need anything extra or refilled.<br><br>While this place has ties to Girl & the Goat, it also stands out on its own with a menu completely different from what you'd find across the street. This menu is less fine dining, opting to focus more on comfort food. As a result, it feels more approachable, but the cooking is still just as stellar.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I would advise making reservations we went on a Friday at 130 we had reservations, however with out them we would have waited an hour.

The BF and I shared the This Little Piggy went to China, the 3 sister's oatmeal, and the goat milk latte. I liked all three dishes.

I loved the 3 sister's oatmeal as well, although it was very rich and decadent. I needed a little more blueberry and granola to balance out the dish.

I don't love goat milk but I think this latte was superb in highlighting it. <br><br>Even though I was a little groggy at 6:30 a.m., it was still a very memorable meal.

Not too sweet of a latte either but a little rich (they top it with whipped cream).<br><br>We ended up ordering the everything is everything crumpets and smoked corned beef hash with over medium eggs. The hash was what I was craving and satisfied me but that dish as a whole was a little bland. A little bit of pepper and salt solved that though! The everything is everything is like a lox platter with the most amazing homemade sesame english muffins.

It's 3 waffles with peanutbutter butter, bananas and a bacon syrup(we asked for the regular syrup instead). My husband enjoyed them! He said the waffles were light and fluffy and the peanutbutter butter was different but a good different. The amount of peanutbutter butter they give you is way tooo much. <br><br>The bullseye French toast was unlike something I've ever had. It's an sweet onion brioche with an egg in the middle and topped with fried chicken, strawberries and a bbq maple syrup. At first I thought the sweet onion brioche would be gross for French toast but I was so wrong. The onion flavor was so faint especially in comparison to the other flavors of the dish. The French toast itself wasn't as dense or custardy as I like but it had all the falcons I crave when I went French toast. The egg in the middle was cooked past medium but less than well done. It was a little gooey but not runny. The fried chicken was basic fried chicken. I recommend getting a bit of the egg, French toast and chicken all in one, the flavors work so well together it's amazing. <br><br>I recommend coming here at least once so you can try the bullseye French toast. It's a very unique dish. My husband liked his waffles but they weren't something he'd specifically go back there for.

It was too smoky or overpowering for the fries and it wasn't the meat; I thought something in the chili seasoning was too intense. Goat chili with rice (or even spaghetti, if you're from Cincinnati) may work but on top of french fries wasn't my favorite. <br><br>Sadly I don't live in Chicago to revisit this diner to try other things but with an okay experience on this go, I'd rather go to the Girl and Goat restaurant on my next visit.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Upon recommendation by my Chicago-resident cousin, a group of 5 of us showed up around 1:15 PM on Monday afternoon.

My sister made the reservation for us to sit at the diner, however, when I arrived I told the hostess that I had back pain and could not sit at the diner bar comfortably. Instead of trying to be hospitable, she would not accommodate​. She told me that the only way I could get another seat was if I waited in line, AGAIN, for 35 minutes. I thought that was rude and uninviting​, considering that I already waited 40 minutes to be seated the first time and there were plenty of tables to be seated at. <br><br>Also, I feel as though the employees/waiters at the restaurant​ are miserable. Specifically, I feel this way because my server disappeared for 20 minutes and when she returned, she had tears in her eyes and looked as though she had been crying for awhile. When I asked if she was fine, she said everything is okay but that there is a lot​ going on in the restaurant at the moment. Further, I noticed this theme was recurrent​ when speaking with other employees that work there. As an individual that has a lot​ of experience with human resource management, it is easy for me to decipher whether an environment is extremely negative with poor management. <br><br>As for the food, I did not enjoy it much. We tried the best two dishes on the menu, which are the bull's eye french toast and the little piggy. The dishes do look appetizing​, and I thoroughly​ enjoyed its appearance​. However, the taste was completely off. Each dish felt as though it had a clash of ingredients, ​as if something was throwing the taste off. Although the chef's skills seem spectacular due to his or her's ability to place an egg in between each piece of toast. Still, I do not feel as though the sweet onion brioche and syrup flavor complimented the french toast at all. The hot cocoa did taste good though, fairly decent compared to everything else at the restaurant. <br><br>Although the food does not taste good and the employees seem like they are treated badly by management, the diner's decor is impressive. The only reason why I gave this restaurant​ any stars was because the employees work hard and the decor is wonderful. Very rarely do I give restaurants​ bad reviews, however, ​I feel as though this restaurant is horrible and malodorous​. <br><br>Also, I noticed that the restaurant was packed a bit, but I could guarantee that this is the type of place people come to once due to its location (since neighboring restaurants are always full- au cheval) and social media marketing, but never return.

The menu is brimming with character, full of cute pictures and whimsical names such as \"Cereal killers\" for the breakfast section. <br><br>Some fusion items (read: pork belly with scallion pancakes and bok choy salad) may sound like a hodgepodge to purists, but the Little Goat does a fine job creating a carefully orchestrated mashup of Asian influences with traditional diner food. I do wish there were more goat items, but there were enough intriguing menu choices that ordering was a difficult enough decision.<br><br>I usually do not order grilled cheese at restaurants as it's fool-proof comfort food that can't really go wrong, but the Little Goat's GRILLED CHEESE ($13) was quite exceptional. The blend of gjetost (goat cheese) and cheddar was full-bodied and unique but not overwhelming. The filling was interspersed with savory guanciale (an Italian cured meat), compounded with bacon gouda bread grilled to the perfect crisp, finished off with apple-tomato relish as a curve-ball--a little sweet and almost a teaser as homage to the Chicago deep dish. (Either that or I'm just over-interpreting my grilled cheese).<br><br>Boo is a burger fan and got the CHOP CHAE ($13) under the burger section, though there was no warning that the burger arrives deconstructed. It was more of a patty with a egg over a blend of japchae noodles, assorted Asian vegetables, and umami mayo. Though the burger patty was somewhat dry, overall I was quite impressed that they pulled off a japchae burger. <br><br>The ambiance is a modern take on the traditional diner, with neutral tones and trendy furniture replacing the traditional red bar stools and checkered patterns.

We arrived in Chicago after midnight so it was tough, but the staff was welcoming and the food didn't take long. Plus the large booths were comfy and great for a bouncy 2.75 year old ;-) <br><br>For food, I had the shrimp and grits - a bit salty, but flavorful. Very mild spice and it was very stew like. My husband had the bulls eye French toast which is a egg in the hole style with pre-chopped pieces of fried chicken breast (think the sized pieces like you'd get in a salad). I know it's messier, but with both our dishes I would have preferred shrimp in the shells and chicken on the bone. I feel like at what's considered an upscale diner they'd have large prawns perhaps or show you that the shrimp have been grilled or something. Do midwesterners prefer this style i wonder?

There's a lot to enjoy here with your traditional french toast but with some chicken tenders, berries and just all around good stuff. It's a perfect blend of that sweet and savory.<br><br>- THE PANCAKES. Ok, recently I've become a bit of a connoisseur of pancakes. Little Goat has this art of pancake perfected.

The cut of beef was so tender that I thought I was eating a quality prime rib sandwich! Generously large sandwich. It was served with au jus, which I've never had before so I might be wrong, but it tasted a little bland and greasy. <br><br>The items on the menu are so diverse and interesting that I wish I could have tried more.

The goat almighty was literally a feet tall packed with beef, pork and goat, topped with pickle, jalapenos, piri piri sauce, and a masa chip. Had to use a fork and knife until 2/3 of the way before we can hold that burger and took a bite. It was huge! The beef was super tender, the goat was in a patty but you can taste the gamey-ness of it. The pork was shredded like pull pork. I love that there was a piece of masa  chip to help absorb some of the juice so that the bottom bun was not mushy. It also add a nice crunch to the  burger. Even it was a big dish that  easily feed 2-3 people, it was surprisingly not heavy. The only critique I had was that meat was bland. It could definitely use some kind of seasoning. On the other hand, the pork belly fries was overly salty. I can only eat a few bites of it before drinking water. They did not use traditional fries, but roasted potatoes which was a little unexpected but it was all good. The pork belly was fat, crunchy and plump but still overly salted. I am still drinking water now as we speak. <br><br>Service was good, our waitress was knowledgeable and nice. Overall, even though the price is a little high for a diner, the portion justified it.

The combo of the bread, eggs, sausage was brought together by the chili garlic chive sauce. Not the most typical brunch dish, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The Bull's Eye French Toast was a little less appealing. The chicken was crisp to perfection, but the overall syrup was too sweet. I wasn't a fan of the soggy bread or the eggs in the middle.

My husband and I made reservations, but when we got there our seats were given away. It had rained and so they put everyone who was outside inside. Which isn't a huge deal, but I am diabetic and can't have too big of a gap between meals. I finally asked to speak with a manager, who was very friendly and patient and found us seats at a communal table that runs the middle of the restaurant. My sugar was too low by then, and after waiting for over 5 minutes for a server we just flagged someone down and got a coke for me. Finally our waitress came, and she was very efficient after that. My husband ordered the smoked friend chicken and I ordered the chicken tenders and macaroni and cheese. My husband liked the interesting flavor of his chicken, but they were the smallest pieces of chicken I had ever seen. He had a huge biscuit, that was quite dry. The best dish on the table was his coleslaw. The MAC was decent, had a creamy texture to it. The chicken tenders were terrible. Thick, slightly sweet and slightly burnt batter and over cooked too firm/not juicy chicken. I asked for hot sauce to combat the sweetness, and all they had was in house apricot or chipotle sauce. I can appreciate they make them in house, but it did not help my chicken. I finally gave up eating it. We spent around $40 on this meal, which is a frustrating feeling when the food is not up to par.

The little piggy meet China was a breakfast sandwich covered in their version of a Sichuan sauce w a mild amount of the numbing peppercorns. It was a very unique and well balanced dish. The oatmeal I only had a small taste of because it was for my toddler. She didn't like it because she has the typical refined toddler palate. I had a taste and the steel cut oats were very creamy and all the flavors really meddled well together. I also had the little goat latte which uses goat milk and tons of spices. It tasted like a chai latte on steroids. The flavor profile was very unique but extremely tasty. I wished I had opted for the whipped cream because that would have been that hit of sugar it needed. I should have known that each component of each dish/drink has been thought out and I should not alter or substitute.<br><br>Little goat diner may not be for everyone but for me it was the perfect fusion of the typical w an unexpected twist. <br><br>5 stars for food and concept but only 3 stars for service.

It's a sunny side egg wrapped in an indian flat bread topped with a whopping amount of avocado, salad, red kidney beans and pickles.

Both were really good (my brother had me try a little bit of his). I've never had okonomiyaki before but I saw a video of Chef Izard preparing it so I was definitely curious after that. It was a savory pancake and it was light and fluffy. It was topped with an egg, fried tempura batter sprinkles and sauce. The burger had 4 layers of meat. It had 1 thick beef patty on the bottom then 2 layers of the braised beef and topped with the pork. I tried both meats and they really complemented each other even though their flavors were so contrasting. The smoked fries were also very addicting considering I don't like fries! For dessert, I ordered the One Twisted Sundae and my brother got the Coffee root beer float. The Sundae had salted caramel ice cream on top of a brownie and mixed in with candied pretzels. It was really good but also very sweet. My brother just devoured his Rootbeer float so I'm guessing he enjoyed it as well!  It was a great spot to stop in for a late lunch.

There is nothing special about it. Even the chicken on the toast is meh. The toast has wayyy too much egg so it feels like you're eating bread and omelet rather than French toast. <br>Okonomiyaki is too similar to the pork belly pancake for me to understand why they have this separate item - it isn't as good as the pork belly pancake. <br>Biscuits and gravy has way too much cumin. It tastes like Indian food...but not in a good way. It just wasn't my style. Biscuits and gravy is my go to at any breakfast place, so I've had many biscuits and gravy dishes, and this one just isn't my favorite. <br>Not sure why so many people like the fish tostada. It's very bland and nothing special. <br><br>The only frustrating thing about this place is they keep changing the breakfast section of the menu. A lot of things I like just aren't there anymore.

The menu is pretty typical diner food with some interesting ethnic twists that I wasn't sure how to feel about. I ordered their popular bullseye French toast, and my friends ordered the chili and the American burger, as well as the One Twisted Sundae. Breakfast is available all day which is amazing!

I really like how they gave extra flavor to the fluffy texture of the grits by dropping a potion of goat milk inside. But the dish became over complicated with pistachios and lettuce.

Given the hype, I was expecting better.<br><br>This is a neat, stylish diner with a bakery attached. One thing I think that's cool about its design is the hidden entrance to the restrooms. The door blends in with the wall like the entrance to some secret lair in a movie. I do like the playfulness about this place from the cartoon graphics on the menu to little touches like actually printing the words \"Blue Plate\" on the blue plate special plates.<br><br>We visited for dinner where the menu consisted of American breakfast foods, breads, sandwiches, soups, salads, burgers, dinner entrees, and apps/sides. Desserts included pies, cakes, shakes, and sundaes and drinks included bottled sodas like Cheerwine, spicy ginger ale, and Mexican Coke. They also have a coffee menu. Expect to spend at least $20-25 per person.<br><br>It's American food, but I wouldn't consider it traditional as many of the dishes have creative twists or takes. Here's what we tried:<br><br>* Reuben ($13) - smoked corned beef, kimchi, kraut, havarti, special sauce, Spence rye<br>* Korean Burger ($14) - kimchi, bacon, egg, chi mayo, sweet roll<br>* Shrimp & Pork Belly ($21) - summer squash, \"shrimpy\" noodles<br>* Blue Plate Special ($23) - Alaskan sockeye salmon, corn miso puree, squash, shiitake, pea tips, sun gold cherry chimichurri<br><br>I love good kimchi and Little Goat's version is actually decent. However, I'm not sure I liked it in the Reuben. The spicy and sour flavors of the kimchi just didn't jive with the traditional Reuben for me. The buttered and toasted bread and the quality of the corned beef was good. The sandwich was a little heavy and salty, but overall, not bad in my opinion.<br><br>The Korean burger was monstrous and a sight to behold (great presentation). It was difficult and messy to eat because of how big the burger was. All of the ingredients were piled on high. I thought the beef patty was delicious and generally, this was a fine burger. Smoky, savory, and satisfying.<br><br>Since I'm allergic to shrimp, I delicately ate my way around the shrimp and pork belly salad. All of the veggies were fresh. This was a simple, light, and refreshing salad. Definitely healthy. The blue plate special for the night was also fresh and healthy. The sockeye salmon was rich in flavor and the vegetable medley worked well together. On the downside, it wasn't filling, but at least I know I was eating smart. I'd order it again.<br><br>Service was excellent. The staff is friendly, attentive, and courteous. Our orders came out in a reasonable amount of time.<br><br>In the end, I think this place is probably better for breakfast, lunch, or brunch than it is for dinner.

Not because the place is disappointing, but more so because my expectations were probably just too high. This was my first time dining in this part of Chicago so it was nice to see all the people dressed up for Italian, Indian, Chinese, and good ole' American dinners. This place is on the Chicago list of \"rooftop food destinations\" and we weren't able to be seated up there. So that was a bummer. Second, the whole place just felt crammed. Not like I was rubbing shoulders with anyone, but we got this reservation a week in advance and we were seated in a small 2-person table at the end of a divider wall. But let's talk about the actual food  <br><br>Fried Pickles & Onion Rings (5/5)<br>--- Okay, what? $9 put down and I'm expecting just a few shriveled pieces of each with some generic sauce. Wrong. So wrong. We had to take half of this awesome appetizer home. The pieces were huge, the portion was huge, and the sauces were, how you say ... Bone Apple Tea. <br><br>Chicken Pot Pie (5/5)<br>--- N/A<br><br>Goat Almighty<br>--- I don't know where to begin. And that's exactly how you'll feel when the server drops this on your table. This is one of those classic burgers that literally stand 12 inches tall because there's just so many random things within. What I could remember was two huge buns, a goat patty, another meat, chicken, fried onion rings, mini onion rings, and some other stuff. It was big, and I definitely had it for lunch the next day. <br><br>Mac & Cheese, a side of (3/5)<br>--- Here's where the problem lies. I've always said the Mac & Cheese orrrr Mashed Potatoes could either make or break a meal. This one didn't break it, mainly because I didn't even finish it all. Fortunately the burger was just so extreme that the Mac & Cheese was almost irrelevant. But I never forget. It was white cheddar cheese with some crispy breading on top? I'm not really sure but it wasn't great. <br><br>Summary:<br>I'll probably come back if I can get into a private event on the roof. Unfortunately, the chicken pot pie was almost as expensive as the burger and it was only the size of one of the buns. On top of that, or waitress never asked how the food was and only stopped by to fill our waters.

With a reservation, we chose to dine at Little Goat for breakfast. Given that it was a weekday, a reservation wasn't necessary; the restaurant was still 3/4 packed, speaking to its popularity. I'm sure part of it is due to its atmosphere. From walking to the Little Goat, you notice a huge goat spinning on top of the building. Then when you get inside, it reminds you of a cute diner from a movie scene. <br><br>I started with The Little Goat, which is a special latte made with goat milk. I've never had goat milk before, but chose to be adventurous due to the astonishing reviews that this drink had gotten on Yelp. Sadly, I can say I'm not a fan as it tasted like drinking straight up feta cheese - if you're a feta cheese fan, go for it! My friend had the latte, which was good, but nothing differentiating it from your standard latte. <br><br>For our entrees, we split the famous Bull's Eye French Toast and the smoked corned beef hash with eggs. The Bull's Eye French Toast was so good and our favorite as it had the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The sweet came from the syrup and the bread, while the savory came from crunchy pieces of fried chicken. I know, you're thinking \"French toast with fried chicken? For breakfast? How does that work?\" Just order it and you'll see! AND hidden inside the middle of each French toast is a perfectly poached egg! I was so excited when I cut into the middle and saw the yolk oozing out. Yum! The highlight of the smoked corned beef hash was the corned beef. The proportion of corned beef to hash browns was 1:1 and you get slices of corned beef, not speckles of it. Talk about a hearty breakfast! My only compliant is that the dish was a bit oily on the bottom and had a bit too much raw onions. <br><br>The portions at Little Goat are huge, so you can definitely order one entree and a side if you're not that hungry.

Came here for brunch and sat outside in the beautiful weather. We were seated immediately by such a kind hostess. Our waitress was very upbeat and nice and was on top of everything. The food was delicious as per usual. At the end of our meal, my sister scraped away at a part of her burrito. Nestled in it was a huge moth. We figured it fell from the trees above and scraped it out of her food. Immediately the bus boy tending to the tables outside noticed everything and came over to ask if everything was okay with her food. He quickly apologized and took the plate with the bug away. The manager also came out and apologized and offered to remake the burrito, on them. We told him we understood we were sitting outside so it was no worries. He offered to give my sister another iced coffee on the house. Right before we left, he gave us a cookie for my niece and nephew as well. The service is exceptional! We weren't going to say anything, but it was so nice to have them swoop into action and take responsibility even though the bug probably fell in from the trees. The entire team here works well together, and every employee knows how to go above and beyond for the customer!

When you're looking something more casual on Randolph, this a great place to enjoy a laid-back meal.

Parking is definitely more successful toward Madison and we lucked out. Our stroll around the neighborhood brought us to deciding between De Cero and The Little Goat Diner. After skimming the menu and spotting the reuben sandwich, we didn't even think twice. My friend ordered the Reuben, a grapefruit mimosa, and smoked fries, while I ordered a cider and the fried chicken. Wowza. The Reuben was scrumptious with the perfect balance of oozing cheese, toasted rye, and kimchi in place of sauerkraut (close cousin with a little more hear) to cut through the richness of the sandwich. My fried chicken included a breast, drumstick, and wing. I have no idea how long they let the chicken sit in what I'm guessing buttermilk with tabasco, but this chicken was fall off the bone, moist with this amazing crunch on the outside. The only thing left was bones.

I've even skipped a morning lecture to meet a friend here for brunch once. I have a Little Goat Photobooth strip on my wall. Once, when I was drunk, I made a 9pm reservation for a table of one on my birthday. Months before my actual birthday. <br><br>Food: In my trips here I've tried \"This Little Piggy Went to China,\" the Bi Bim Bop Breakfast Bowl, the Shrimp Salad (from their summer menu I believe), the Chickpea Salad, the Bahn Mi style burger, their nachos, their broccoli, their Reuben, the \"Goat Almighty,\" and their Smoked Pork & Toffee Crunch Shake. I particularly love their broccoli and Chickpea salad. I've never been disappointed with the flavors and quality of food, with my only complaint being that the salads and the breakfast bowls have, on occasion, been overdressed/overseasoned. Stephanie Izard is a genius at integrating and balancing flavors; you seriously can't go wrong with anything on the menu. <br><br>Service/Atmosphere: The Little Goat decor takes quintessential American diner items and decor and gives them a serious upgrade.

She's a Top Chef Winner (Season 4), was announced as Food & Wine magazine's \"Best New Chef\" (in 2011), and now runs three successful and highly acclaimed restaurants in Chicago's West Loop neighborhood. The original, Girl & The Goat, was awarded 'Best New Restaurant' by Saveur magazine. And Duck Duck Goat, a Chinese-inspired restaurant has also become a Chicago favorite. **Be sure to make reservations for those places as they book up weeks in advance. Or they also take walk-ins, so feel free to take a chance!<br><br>If you're like me, and it's too late, and you're in Chicago and you didn't plan your meals at all then you should definitely pop into Little Goat Diner. The idea behind Little Goat Diner was to allow the growing bakery program from Girl & The Goat to flourish and offer patrons seeking a taste of Izard an easier and more accessible option. <br><br>We showed up for breakfast, we were in town for Lollapalooza- a popular music festival, and really only had breakfast and lunch to explore Chicago's food scene since we'd be at the festival during dinnertime. Knowing I didn't have a shot at Izard's other restaurants, I happily took the opportunity to head to Little Goat Diner for breakfast. <br><br>From the moment we showed up I was in love, the layout of the space is just delightful, bright and airy. It's refreshing to be inside, and the atmosphere puts you in a good mood. The team at Little Goat Diner was so welcoming too, answering all of our questions about what to eat on the menu. And I'm glad we asked, and I'm glad we listened. <br><br>The menu offers very traditional breakfast items from pancakes to eggs, and also puts a little spin on it by incorporating Izard's whimsy into the dishes. We started off with some coffee, I opted for the Barista's Special. It was essentially a S'mores latte, topped with a nice heap of marshmallow fluff.

This review is the honest facts that happened to me both times I've been to this diner.<br><br>First time here:<br>Made reservations for my husband and I and was seated right away. However, it took 10 minutes to get water and another 5 for the waitress to introduce herself, this is not an exaggeration, just facts. Another 10 minutes for my waitress to come back with our drink order and finally take our food order.  She asked me what I wanted in a rushed way and when I was done, she grabbed my menu and my husband's, didn't say a word, and walked away....COMPLETELY FORGETTING TO TAKE MY HUSBAND'S ORDER. We had to wave her down 5 minutes later to order and for this she apologized so we let that go. So by the time we put in our full order, we had been sitting in the restaurant for 30 Minutes. The only reason I stayed and did not leave mid dinner was the fact that people raved about the food...This I concur,  is true. Food was delicious, innovative,  and very unique.  I had the pork belly fries with the grilled cheese and it was the BEST thing I've ever eaten in a while.  The only reason I even wanted to give this place a second chance was for their glorious food...which leads me to my second chance visit.<br><br>Second visit: <br>Made reservation for a bunch of my girlfriends for brunch. Looking forward to see if my experience will be better this time around. We were given water right away,  greeted within 5 minutes by the waiter, he was attentive so, I was quite optimistic. I ordered the \"little piggy went to china\" breakfast that according to the menu has sunny side up eggs...which can really be made over easy, over medium etc, I wasn't asked by the server. My food arrives and though smelled delicious, my egg whites were still CLEAR. Granted I wish they were more specific as to how cooked this sunny side up egg would be, but the fact that I'm pregnant and cannot eat uncooked eggs was really bothering me. So I asked the waiter if there's anyway I can have the eggs more cooked and this is what he says: <br>\"Ok so, First of all the chef would not change how your egg is made because it's very insulting to him. Also it would be unsanitary to bring this to the kitchen since it touched your table.\"<br>Which are all very valid points but what's insulting is how this was his initial response. So I suggesed if he can just bring me a more well done egg to the table and for this he agreed right away. So why the fuss when that could've just been suggested by him to begin with? I don't expect every waiter to empathize with their pregnant customers, but not insulting the chef's ego cause I wanted my egg more well done for the safety of my unborn child was a bigger priority for him in this case. He could've just easily solved my dilemma by suggesting bringing a more cooked egg to the table, but he found it necessary to mouth off to a paying customer.<br><br>I really, really wanted to like this place and even went back a second time to give it a chance. But man, for the caliber of food they serve, the waitstaff needs some serious training. I was a server and busgirl for 5 years and these guys weren't even meeting the bare minimum expectations of what a server should be in a reputable place.

The tempura mash potato was so well done.  Creamy starchy interior was perfectly battered and fried to a greaseless crunch that was still crispy 10 minutes later.  Is it indulgent yes but whoever came up with this idea ... I love you.  The fish sauce pea greens was a nice Vietnamese influenced dish.  I really liked the sweet and pungent savory fish notes to the crunchy greens.  <br><br>Our ending to the night was a great lemon curd tart that coverted a lemon hater.  A thick buttery graham tart shell contained a creamy bright lemon curd that was lightly covered with a blueberry sauce.  Loved this!!<br><br>Lastly the service was phenomenal ...

The way to go around this if you don't have a reservation would be to check out their bar to see if there are open spots. The entire menu is available for ordering there, and lucky for us, we were able to snag seats within 10 minutes. Not bad, yeah?<br><br>We had a cup of GOAT CHILI ($6) which was hearty and scrumptious without that heavy feel. It wasn't gamey at all, in fact, it's the goat meat flavor that carried this one through. Their BISCUITS and GRAVY ($6/sm) on the other hand was one big giant flaky and buttery biscuit smothered with gravy cooked with pork sausage and mushrooms. Drooling yet? I asked for more gravy on the side and the bartender gladly gave me a full cup. Don't judge me, it was that good! <br><br>For my main entree, I got the BULL'S EYE FRENCH TOAST ($16) topped with crispy chicken pieces and fresh strawberry slices, then drizzled with bbq maple syrup. It was a lovely plate but the magic happened when I cut open my sweet onion brioche -  a glorious yellow yolk oozed out! Little did I know a beautifully cooked egg was going to surprise me in the middle of all that. So rad!  <br><br>I switched plates with my husband halfway through my meal to have some of his SHRIMP and GRITS ($16). This Southern fare is always delightful to have but by throwing in some braised pistachios and using grumpy goat grits made Chef Stephanie's twist on this extra brilliant. <br><br>Service was top-notch across the board.

Thus Little Goat Diner made it onto our itinerary filled with some of the more iconic Chicago eats since Girl and the Goat had so much hype but it was difficult to get my large group a reservation there. <br><br>We had a reservation for 2:15 pm for a late lunch and overall service was pretty good. We ordered the goat chili cheese fries and the macho nachos as appetizers, both of which were delicious and very satisfying. I love that the place has a diner feel but reinvents the dishes to make everything a little more interesting. The chili was made with goat (of course) and had a nice subtly different taste to it.  The nachos were even better, with unique masa-based chips and delicious toppings. Unfortunately, that's where the highlights for us stopped as the entrees paled in comparison. Part of the reason was that the \"snacks\" we ordered were very heavy and also came in very large portions which probably took away from the entrees a bit. But even so, none of us were really impressed with the entrees we ordered (Bull's Eye French Toast, Fish Tostada, Okonomiyaki, etc.) That's not to say anything was bad at all -- just underwhelming. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I probably wouldn't recommend this place if you're only interested in it for the hype.

At this restaurant however you purchase everything separately.

Everything was tasty (though very unhealthy). Portions of some items are huge (e.g. some of the sandwiches and the special goat burger), but others were just modest. Hash browns were a good size, crispy and hot, but super greasy. The Asian-fusion foods did, in fact, taste Asian, and I enjoyed the meal. The burger was on grilled bread (rather than a bun) and was smothered in butter and cheese (a win for me), but it's disappointing that it doesn't come with anything else. The milkshake was decent. The one reason why I would say 3.5 stars is that the prices seem to be extremely steep for the items we ordered. $8 for a milkshake and $14 for a regular sized burger with nothing else is more than I would expect for a casual brunch. <br><br>Overall, food is good, prices are a little high, but if you don't mind paying them, I'd stop by.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Awesome customer service, cool atmosphere, and a great time.

So, I coincidentally happen to be in Chicago during World Series madness. It's Wednesday night, Game 7, and the city is buzzing with sports-fueled tension. This is exciting and all i.e. curse, blah blah, etc. but what is even more exciting is that the most popular and difficult to access restaurants (with no TVs) are unbelievably empty. Little Goat, Au Cheval, heck probably even The Girl & The Goat had tables a plenty--my three foodie compatriots and I strolled right on in to the first. <br><br>Little Goat definitely achieves an elevated diner feel, with squishy bench seats but modern bare bulb lighting. The 90's pop music brought me back and got my head bobbing. Everything, including glasses, plates, and paper utensil wraps, was customized with the Little Goat logo which not only ups the brand but makes the customer feel like they are going through a whole experience. Three of us shared the crab dip and and goat chili cheese fries appetizers. The crab dip has little filler and comes with good ol' Ritz crackers, which might portray kitchen laziness but are at the same time comforting. The dip was a bit salty for my taste. The fries are thin and best eaten with a fork due to chunky chili topping. For my entree, I ordered the This Little Piggy Went To China, which consists of a cheddar biscuit with sausage and sunny side up eggs surrounded by gooseberry sauce. I had never had gooseberries before, and they tasted like sweeter tomatoes. As much as I wanted to love my dinner, I didn't for the simple reason that the tart sauce overpowered all of the actual food it enveloped. The portions are large and very filling, though. Honestly, I would rate Little Goat three stars if it weren't for the fun breakfast-for-dinner options and the restaurant's overall fun vibe. However, I would totally come back to try other dishes as well as their shakes.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/j0jLTzvifqrL6pHoYOH9Yg/348s.jpg", "caption": "This Little Piggy Went To China"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qcvKq947QUoCkoPaqcarNg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Goat chili cheese fries"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/o2E3wLTXzldAyxiN95aX_Q/168s.jpg", "caption": "Crab dip with Ritz crackers"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Amazing place.

Located in the West Loop, this holds down the corner across from Bar Siena. I recommend making a reservation, and possibly dining early. We made ours for 530pm on a Saturday(blue plate anyone?) but it actually made perfect sense...the place was plenty busy already anyway, and as we dined, the throng of expectant diners waiting near the door just grew and grew and grew. Made our early dining time seem like a super smart idea! Of course, I can't take the credit for eating at 530. My usual dinner time is about 9pm, so...all credit goes to the lady. <br><br>For appetizers, we ordered drinks. I got the Old Fashioned, made with George Dickel 8 year Bourbon, and she got the Cherry Smoke Bomb, a mezcal based drink. Tell me if you've heard this story before. Man drinks 375ml of Mezcal, proceeds to play a horrible game of Classic Concentration while being filmed, and then goes on a drunken rant about Half Price Books' buy-back policy. Same man also splits a bottle of mezcal with a girl he picked up at the bar, and after drinking her half of the bottle she begins wailing the lyrics to a Shiny Toy Guns song, and crying while said man drunkenly stares in disbelief. <br><br>Yeah, that man was me. Me and mezcal have a storied history. We don't play well together. And yet, this Cherry Smoke Bomb deal was actually pretty good, making me rethink our relationship. Like maybe me and mezcal aren't meant to be monogamous. No, we probably need a little polyamory in our lives. Anyway....it was pretty good for something I expected to taste and smell like bad decisions. The Old Fashioned was good as well. Bourbon, sugar, and orange bitters, well balanced and tasty. <br><br>On to the food. Dining partner is a pescetarian, so not wanting to shut the sharing door on her, I ordered the gemelli with mushroom ragout, she got the spiced sautéed shrimp, and we split a bowl of the Brussels sprouts. Wasn't disappointed about my pasta choice being meatless. In fact, I actually wanted breakfast food for dinner, but we both thought it might be a little strange to have with our cocktails, so I opted against it. The mushrooms have just enough umami to make the pasta kind of meaty on its own, and as it turns out, she loves mushrooms too! The overall profile of that dish made it so I didn't miss the meat, and that's a great feat to accomplish. Her dish was pretty good as well, although I didn't really taste the Kim chee in the dish as described on the menu. Brussels sprouts - don't let the fish sauce discourage you! It had almonds and a fish sauce vinaigrette, topped with crispy onions that look like Durkees but taste like homemade. So good. Like a warm salad. Not sure if warm salad is really your speed or not, but the dish worked well. I mean, we were scraping the bowl. So there's that.<br><br>We were seated at the counter and my eyes would start to blur if I stared ahead at the half wall that separates the kitchen from the dining area. Don't be like me. Being seated right next to each other at the counter was good for us however, as it is a bit loud in the restaurant just due to the number of people all having conversations at once.

The menu had plenty of brunch items, as well as sandwiches, soups and salads, a handful of which seemed to be asian-fushion. I ordered the apple-tomato soup, which warmed me up after traveling through the wind and rain. The soup had two unique flavors which actually worked well together: creamy tomato, with a sweet aftertaste. I often hesitate to order salads at restaurants because of the chance I might be paying for overpriced lettuce, but this place is definitely worth it! For only $7, i got a substantial caesar salad packed with fresh ingredients: romaine kale, radish, bell peppers, and beets.

I don't even like dark chocolate. The pile of 3 large pancakes had chunks of dark chocolate chips and malt balls, which made it slightly crunchy.

However since everything in this dish is drenched in Maple Syrup (didn't really taste any BBQ flavor), the egg tasted like weird solid custard.  Nope. The pieces of crispy chicken (white meat) was good but it was just so drowned in syrup that it made it overly sweet and not crunchy any longer.

I'd long been a fan of Stephanie Izard after watching (and rooting for her to) win Top Chef many years ago and I'd heard of her amazing restaurants in Chicago. The time finally came for me to come to Stephanie's city and try, for the first time, her award winning food.<br><br>Being a party of 1 and only having time for one meal here, there was no way I could order everything I wanted to try. I ended up with the Los Drowned - a french dip-esque sandwich but elevated and FAR better. The Los Drowned come with braised beef (that basically melts in your mouth), havarti, avocado, pickled peppers & onions, and spicy mayo on a hoagie. I mean. Sound simple, but nononono - it was HEAVENLY. I've never had a sandwich so satisfying for my soul. It was life changing, really.<br><br>I opted to have some fries on the side which were perfectly seasoned with some kind of spicy ranch salt - super delicious - but I was so full from my sandwich that I didn't need too many fries.<br><br>Of course, being full, somehow, didn't stop me from ordering dessert...I mean...two desserts...heh. I ended up getting the french silk pie, which is basically the most perfect chocolate pudding in the most perfect crust, topped with crunchy chocolate somethings and served with a giant dollop of whipped cream on the side. I'm not even that big of a chocolate fan, but this. I could eat this every day. (Thank God I don't live there, so I actually cannot eat this every day).<br><br>My second dessert was really to appease my curiosity - the smoked pork and toffee crunch shake. OH DEAR LORD. The savoriness of bacon with the sweet crunch of toffee. It certainly wasn't a \"light\" milkshake (does that even exist??) but it was so amazingly delectable, my tastebuds went wild!<br><br>Biggest plus of this visit - I saw Stephanie Izard!! I'm a little sad I didn't get to say hi to her, but the waitress said that she was really busy getting ready for a big event.

It seemed like a more casual restaurant with a way broader menu that included breakfast stuff, sandwiches, tapas style snacks, and also heavier dishes. Little Goat was a place I wouldn't really plan ahead for and make reservations in advance like you have to for GaTG, which is probably why I haven't checked it out until now. Every time I would drop by to try to get a table there would be a huge wait, and with all the other great options on Randolph, it just never seemed worth it. <br><br>We were getting hungry late on a Friday night and took a stroll down to the West Loop to find some good late night eats. After finding out Grange Hall's kitchen was closed we just took a shot at Little Goat. Usually when passing by Little Goat I've come to just assume the wait is longer than I'm willing to deal with, but surprisingly we were seated immediately. I guess 11PM is a sweet spot.<br><br>Ambiance: The inside had that modern take on a classic dinner type of vibe. There were a bunch of booths and a lunch counter in front of the kitchen. Even the plates and condiments at the table reminded me of a diner-ish atmosphere. <br><br>Food: Since the menu was so big, there wasn't an obvious clear cut item to try that everyone was raving about. We just ended up ordering a bunch of stuff with a lot of meat in it haha.<br><br>Goat Almighty Burger - DAMN, is all I gotta say. All the signs of its enormity were there: it cost $20 and even the waiter flat out warned us that it was pretty big. Having some pretty large appetites though, we sort've just dismissed these clues. Let's just say we were pretty shocked when it was brought to our table. This monster of a burger had two skewers lodged in there just to keep it upright. It was just so tall that there was no other way to eat it besides fork and knifing the thing or eating the top and bottom halves separately. <br><br>Now I've had a full pound burger patty at other restaurants before but I think collectively all the meats in this thing outweighs it. The base was a goat burger patty with cheese on it. Ok, good start. Then throw on some braised beef. Then pile on a huge mound of pulled pork. And then just top it off with some jumbo onion rings. Just ridiculous. I can't even really pinpoint each ingredient individually. It was dark, I was drunk, and there was just a pile of meat in front of me. All I know is every bite of that sandwich was tender, juicy and delicious. <br><br>Sloppy Goat - It was good, but I probably wouldn't have been able to tell the difference if they swapped out the goat for beef. The slaw on top gave it a nice cooling flavor and a little bit of crunch. The bread was just great. Usually bread is just a silent component of a sandwich, but this roll really stood out in both texture and the way it meshed well with the other ingredients. <br><br>Fried Chicken - The chicken was actually really tasty. The skin/breading was very light and crunchy and did not at all have that greasy taste/texture. The meat was ultra juicy too. My only complaint is that it was a little on the small side. The breast seemed more like half the size of what you get at KFC/Popeyes. I wasn't the biggest fan of the coleslaw that was on the side, but it was topped with some delicious crunchy fried onions so it was ok.<br><br>Hash Browns - You can't go to a diner and not get any breakfast food, so I decided to throw these in there too. The potatoes were cut really thin and fried extra crispy, which is a plus for me. It didn't look very cheesy but that richness was felt with every bite (and the next morning too haha).<br><br>Overall, I enjoyed eating at Little Goat and would come back whenever the wait is reasonable.

Sure, she's the first female chef to win Top Chef. But more importantly, she's staked her culinary claim in the West Loop area of Chicago, which is certainly a dining hot spot. Chef Izard's got Girl and the Goat & Little Goat Diner amidst bastions such as Aviary & Next as well as Publican & Blackbird. And something's clearly going right in her kitchen, because both of her locations are regularly packed. <br><br>Case in point - I popped in for an early lunch during a week of conferencing in the city. And Little Goat was stuffed to the brim, whether diners were enjoying themselves al fresco or within. Little Goat is Chef Izard's upscale, yet unpretentious, diner. It features a wide gamut of classics with some culinary twists, many of which were Asian-inspired. I pulled up a seat at the counter, which offered a decent view of the kitchen at work.<br><br>Smoked Pork & Toffee Crunch Shake [$7]<br><br>I had to start off with this shake, considering my entire dining experience this trip was essentially a gustatory gamut of carnivorous delights. The foundation of smokiness was quite intense, but the sweet and salty elements of the toffee crunch helped to create some balance. There were small chunks of pork interspersed throughout the shake, which was tasty overall, but more gimmick for me than a must-order. <br> <br>Pork Belly Pancake [$13]<br>Scallion pancake, house hoisin, bok choy salad, ginger maple dressing<br><br>On the other hand, you'd be hard pressed not to find me ordering this must-have dish. I appreciated that the Asian flavors weren't overtly in your face, but I found myself wondering how I wasn't indulging in an elevated Peking duck meal, supplanted with a crisp and hefty portion of pork belly. The gluttonous chew from the scallion pancake was on point and provided a nice textural contrast with the crisp bok choy slaw. The slaw which had just enough acidity to balance out the pork belly which was hidden beneath. <br><br>Well-crisped on the outside, it yielded to a trembling and unctuous cut of belly that was absolutely delicious. The ginger maple dressing helped to provide some sweet spice to counter the savory elements, while the fried wonton strips provided additional texture for each bite.  <br><br>Mac n Cheese [$7]<br>Camembert, cheddar<br><br>It's a safe bet that I'll always try the mac n cheese. This iteration featured sharp cheddar melded with creamy Camembert. The well-seasoned marriage lent itself to a creaminess that clung to the al dente shells, topped with crisp and buttery bread crumbs. Nothing wrong here. <br><br>Overall, I was impressed with Chef Izard's upscale diner. The menu is large, but considering the long hours it's open and the impressive crowds it pulls in, there's plenty to satiate a wide variety of appetites.

So several minutes later when he walks by again I ask for milk and sugar and he's like fine but there's sugar right in front of you and before I can clarify that I wanted the fake stuff he walked away again.  Came back again several minutes later with the milk and I asked him for the truvia which took another few minutes to grab a couple packets of sugar... Rinse and repeat this several minute long fiasco for a second time with coffee refills, during which time he told me he heard me ask for milk (even though he walked by several times and never bothered to drop it off). Basically I had cold coffee with breakfast with a side of major attitude, and messing with coffee in the morning is like messing with alcohol during happy hour, it's just not done.  If he hadn't been so dismissive and a little nicer I probably would have given him a pass since I've been on the other side of the counter and understand the breakfast rush, but he seriously put a damper on my Saturday morning.<br><br>Moving on to the food, had a really good omelette of the day with eggplant and scallions (and I don't even like  omelettes...)

We came here after learning that both Girl & The Goat and Au Cheval had 2+ hour waits, and we were starving. Unfortunately, even our hunger could not disguise the quality of the food. :( <br><br>+ Chocolate Goat Milk - I was really excited for this because I love goat products, but this tasted like chocolate cow milk. I felt very silly paying so much for what basically tastes like normal chocolate milk. <br><br>+ Crab Dip - The dip wasn't bad flavor-wise (arguably the best thing we got here) but even though the dish was hot, the dip inside was still cold. It was definitely full of crabmeat and was tasty, but it would've been exponentially better if it had been warm. The crackers on the side were basically Ritz crackers - very uniform and buttery. The waitress kindly offered us a second batch of crackers when she noticed that we were low, but the second batch was all super crumbly and fragile; they all broke immediately when we tried to dip them. <br><br>+ All-American Burger - Their special sauce tastes remarkably like McDonald's special sauce. The resemblance to a Big Mac flavor-wise was utterly uncanny. It tastes good, but that was really strange ... unless they mean to imply that McDonald's represents \"All-American\"? <br><br>+ Shrimp, Pork Belly, Zucchini and Shrimpy Noodles - Aside from the tender, tasty pork belly, this was unpalatable. I was shocked by this horrible rendition of an Asian-inspired dish (would not have gotten it if it had said that on the menu) - the noodles and veggies were drowning in ginger and soy sauce. The shrimp was overcooked and the veggies were ruined by the overpowering sauce. <br><br>The crab dip was very filling, which was a good thing because I really could not make myself eat the shrimp/pork belly disaster that I got. I probably should've stuck with something goat, so I guess that's my fault.

The menu has all the diner offerings you could want: breakfast items, sandwiches, burgers, appetizers, and supper items. Yet, all of these dishes seem to be a twist on their respective classic versions. We ordered the goat patty melt, pork belly pancake, and the Korean goat burger. I wasn't pleased that the burgers didn't come with fries, but we ordered a side of the smoked fries, and they were great. The potatoes were cut just right, and the smokey flavor was pretty addicting. The patty melt was awesome, with just the right amount of goat to bread, and the pickles provided the sourness and crunchiness. The pork belly pancake was well-balanced with the vegetables and pork belly. The Korean goat burger came with an egg on top, which was super rich and delicious.<br><br>Our waiter was very friendly and helpful with recommendations, but seemed to forget about our table at times. Prices are fine, although again, I think the sandwiches/burgers should come with fries. Just a pet peeve of mine. I really would like to try the Goat Almighty, which is the colossal goat burger with BBQ pork, braised beef, and onion rings, and many other toppings.

During this trip, I was determined to eat at either Girl and the Goat or Little Goat, which were conveniently right across the street from each other. My friends and I couldn't get a table at Girl and the Goat so we opted for Little Goat. This cool, laid-back diner was buzzing with the sounds like a classic 50's diner.

I ended up getting a faux noodle dish - Tofu Noodles with Spring Peas, Peanuts and Chilies in a Blueberry Szechuan Sauce. I've eaten of these ingredients at some point in my ongoing culinary quest around the country, but I've never eaten them all together in one flavor exploding bowl. The tofu noodles were incredible to the point that I forgot that they were made of tofu. The spring peas and and peanuts added great textural contrast.

One thing I wish I'd known ahead of time is how impossible it was going to be to park nearby -- it's not a problem we generally have in Indianapolis. Just go into your experience at Little Goat Diner or anywhere nearby knowing that you will either be walking a little like I did or paying for a valet. Did I have a reservation?

However, the service left more to be desired and the food wasn't anywhere near as good as Girl and the Goat. A little coffee area is conjoined with the diner. I didn't try the coffee, but it looked really cute and we decided to wait in that area. <br><br>Food: After about a 40 min wait, we were seated in the stools, which were very uncomfortable. We got the machos nachos, fish tostadas, and Bahn Mi Style burger. The best part of the meal was the machos nachos. It was packed with flavor. I loved the pickled peppers! It was a surprising sweet flavor mixed with delicious fatty and buttery pulled pork. The sauce was an added bonus. The rest of the food left more to be desired. The fish tostadas didn't have a lot of flavor and were hard to eat. I love fish tacos and adding chickpeas to the mix only sounds good. I wish the fish was flakey and had more flavor. The bahn mi style burger was pretty good. It was much better on paper than it was in my stomach. It is hard to pinpoint exactly what was wrong as I am not an executive chef, but it was just lacking something to put it over the top. A delicious sauce or some fresh veggies would have done wonders. Overall, it was ok. <br><br>Service: The service was pretty bad. We were sitting on the stools and watched the food pop out. However, it took 20 mins to have someone notice us. All the waitresses were so focused on their tables they forgot about us! Eventually we had to flag someone down to take our order and she passed us along to someone else. She was prompt enough getting our drinks, but the food took longer. Since we had the view, we saw our food sitting through the food window for a while. All she had to do was literally pick up the food turn around and place it in front of us. She must have decided since we weren't a table it wasn't worth her time. <br><br>Overall, I will probably give Little Goat another chance.

Yeehaw!<br><br>I've tried so many things on the menu that I've loved here. From the Sloppy Goat to the Bull's Eye French Toast to the This Little Piggy Went to China, all the dishes shy away from regular old diner food to give you something that you most likely have never tried before.

The attire of the staff gave me a country western vibe. Our server was attentive and I loved how often my glass of water was refilled.<br><br>Our meal was pretty simple, so it came out quickly. The biscuits and gravy were very good. The sausage within the gravy was not too salty and the two biscuits were firm and did not become soggy under the blanket of gravy. I was halfway through eating a biscuit, when our Bulls Eye French Toast arrived. I have a devastating sweet tooth, so the appearance of syrup drenched French toast with fresh strawberries pleased me. The French Toast was delicious and the bite-sized pieces of fried chicken strewn atop went surprisingly well with the sweetness of the bbq syrup. After this carbo-load, I felt pretty full, but pretty good and almost forgot all my worries.

I have to say, I was more than eager to try it out and had very high expectation, mostly from friends' recommendation and terrific online reviews. So when my friend had a short and sweet transit in Chicago on her way back to WI, I suggested Little Goat for breakfast. My bf and I got to the place at about 9 am, didn't realize that most parking on Randolph is valet, so we did meter parking on Washington street, less than 2 blocks away, and saved $14. My friend was already there, so we got seated almost immediately. Don't get me wrong, the place was almost packed, so if we had gotten there closer to brunch time, I'm sure we would wait a little longer. <br>The waitress was welcoming, but in terms of helpfulness when I asked about her recommendations since it was our first time there, I didn't think she elaborated enough about their popular dishes or seasonal offers. That said, she did advise us to narrow down to about 3 choices, then she would be able to make further suggestion. So, that was a great alternative. <br>The 3 of us ended up ordering the special omelette (which came with smoked salmon I believe), this little piggy went to china (my dish), and the parathas burrito. Food came out in what felt like 10 minutes or less, super savory-looking and actually in the perfect portion. My dish was a little on the salty side, probably from the heavy chili garlic chive sauce, but I enjoyed the biscuit and 2 perfectly-cooked eggs, and instead of gooseberries, grapefruit chunks. <br>Overall, it was a satisfying, nutrient-filled breakfast! I liked the fact that the size of our food was perfect, enough to make everyone full and happy. However, I thought the price could be a little lower, since we could probably get a bigger portion had we gone to a different breakfast place. Easy parking was another bonus! Our waitress brought out one bill but was willing to split it accordingly to our preference, so we appreciated the service.

At noon on a Friday. There are definite benefits to being only a group of two. <br><br>We started with a cup of the goat chili, which had a great flavor and the additional texture of the various toppings really made the dish stand out as more than just a cup of soup.

The great thing about the pork belly was that it properly walked the line between meaty and fatty. It really showed why pork belly can be so delicious when cooked properly. A quibble, if only a minor one, was that the pancake was a tad chewier than I would have liked. <br><br>The waffle was, wow, it was great. Honestly, it should qualify as a dessert given how decadent and rich it was. The whipped peanut butter was addictive, and the bacon syrup was just incredible. Together the combination of flavors was terrific. <br><br>Thankfully, I only shared a few bites of the waffle. That way I could justify ordering dessert. The pork and toffee sundae sounded like nothing I'd ever had before, so I had to try it. And, while tasty, it was perhaps the least stand out of the dishes we tried. Not that it was BAD, oh no.

Of course, I was excited to try one of her restos and am still recovering from one seriously hearty meal that warmed my soul -- head to toe. I think we ordered nearly every appetizer on the menu so our entrees were in excess. Pure gluttony all around. That's how I want to spend my days in Chicago or anywhere for that matter.<br><br>- I think Little Goat should be dubbed my personal fave nachos, like ever. The refried beans were the best part or maybe it was that uber flavor packed tender pulled pork... wait, the homemade tortilla chips? Yeah, let's just go with all of it, topped with a hefty dollop of guac.<br>- Mac and cheese a must. I think I asked for more than my helping -- seconds, thirds, the last bite. <br>- Entree: half order of biscuits and gravy with a side of cheesy grits: whaaaat. Amazing. This is my fave thing to order, always for a little southern comfort. Little Goat delivered a slightly upgraded version of B&G with pork sausage & mushroom gravy atop a flaky, buttery biscuit.<br>- Fried pickles should be on your radar. Awesome batter, that's not too heavy and the perfect salty complement to the tangy pickle.<br><br>I had a beer too... something local, but it was overshadowed by my desire for all of the carbs.<br><br>Loved the swanky diner vibe.

I was really looking forward to coming here after seeing all of the positive reviews. First, all the hostesses seemed to be in a very cranky mood. They said the wait would be ~20 minutes and so we sat at the bar hoping for a baked good and drink while we waited. The bartender was cleaning glasses, while we sat for a few minutes waiting for someone to clean up the leftover mess from the customers sitting before us. He never said that he would be with us in a moment. After 5 minutes of waiting, I got a text that our table was ready. Went to the hostess and she said that it would be ready in a moment. We then stood for another 5 minutes at the hostess' desk waiting. As I was sat at the booth, I took my hand to brush off the crumbs on my seat. <br><br>We first ordered a cinnamon bun. We were only given 1 napkin, and after waiting for a few minutes, I went to an empty table and grabbed one for myself. The cinnamon bun while it looked great, was mediocre at best. Dry, doughy, and could barely taste the cinnamon. <br><br>The mimosa was served in a small water glass, very unattractive for an alcoholic drink. <br><br>Onto the meal... The French toast was very disappointing, especially served with a chicken finger on top. Cool concept to have an egg cooked inside the French toast, but would have preferred them separate. <br><br>I had to ask if there was cheese on the hash browns and they told me it was inside. I hardly noticed any cheese, however the hash browns were good and crispy.<br><br>The only good dish we had was the shrimp and grits. Savory and nicely balanced.<br><br>Once the food was brought to the table, we had to wait a good 5 minutes for someone to look at me to ask for utensils. After getting someone's attention, someone other than my waiter, I asked, \"Can I please have some utensils?\" He gave me a dirty look and said \"Do you mean you want silverware?\" Our waitress was nice and sweet, but definitely not on the ball.<br><br>It was also quite fitting that the Little Goat had flies buzzing all around, landing on both me and the table occasionally during the meal. <br><br>The restaurant was quite loud, but didn't bother me as it was a casual diner atmosphere.<br><br>The meal was definitely not worth $80!!!

At first, no big deal. I hadn't washed my hair for an extended and undisclosed number of days, it's probably just, you know, build up or whatever. So I continue to sit there and I'm working, typing away when this little thing glides into my frame of sight and then disappears. Maybe a fuzzball? A Gnat? I swat the air once as a precaution and get back to work. <br><br>*Maybe* 8 seconds later, I see the spot again, only it's swinging... because it's a motherf*cking spider! Trying to eat my face. And it's so close to my melon that I don't even have time to freak out. I just start clapping both my hands into the air in hopes of nabbing it and smooshing it to death. And because I believe I was brought into this world to be a natural born (spider) killer, I succeeded. Dead as a f*cking doornail. <br><br>... But then... Arachnophobia. 2013. Starring Candice G. John Goodman is nowhere to be seen. It's all up to me. And there's about a million (like 4 or 5) little spiders coming down from the AC vent above my head. F*ck. Obviously those little f*ckers just got borned in there and I don't know if generic Target brand Lysol is strong enough to kill them all. And I have no idea how many are already nesting in my weave. Now I have to move. You can't undo that. Am I going have to disclose this incident to the next renters? What happens next? Where is my life going? I gotta get out of here. Gotta get outta this town. <br><br>Far away. <br>Far, far away... sort of like Jenny from Forest Gump. <br>Far and away... but with less Tom Cruise & Nicole Kidman. <br>Off to the city, where there are no spiders, (that's a thing, right) but there are goats. Little ones. And one in particular always knows how to cheer me up. Makes me feel warm. and safe. and at home... but sans spiders. <br><br>So I make my way to Little Goat, which is a haul for me coming from the suburbs, but it fits both my main criteria of being far away from my apparently insect-ridden apartment and it's spider-free, to my knowledge. It's not home, but it feels like home. Better than home at this point, actually. <br><br>Now, I've done this LG dance a few times so I'm pretty well-versed in what I NEED to order... brace yourself, it's a lot, but keep in mind that I'd just been through a very traumatic experience and eating my feelings was necessary. <br><br>Get this: <br>* Crispy Shrimp Cocktail - somen noodle wrapped shrimp, cocktail sauce, lettuce wraps. Best thing on the menu. Hands down. <br>* Hot Crab Dip - served with regular ole Ritz crackers, not house-made anything, but the Ritz are perfect and there's so much crab that you won't bat an eyelash at the price. Totally reasonable.<br>* Shrimp and Cheesy Grits - insanely good, very filling<br>* Smoked Fries - meat-free, but tastes like meat in the best possible way and the bowl is huge.<br>* House-made veggie burger with the Korean set - kimchi, bacon, egg, spicy mayo, squish squash roll... but I get it sans bacon.<br>* Veggie Chap Chae - spring onion, patty pan squash, fennel, tomato, sheep's milk cheese, cashews. It's like a pasta-y thing, but it's super fresh, farm-y and full of veggies and queso.<br>* Choco Taco dessert. Heaven in a float glass. <br><br>Okay, okay... I'll admit it. I've had a dining partner with me on every one of my visits so I've technically split all this and I don't actually have the manly appetite that I've led you to believe I have. In fact, I usually have leftovers so this probably enough food for 3 people, but more importantly, it's exactly the amount of food a person needs to forget about a personal tragedy (Re: spider demons).

First of all, the establishment has an incredibly cute goat avatar above the building, which certainly adds to the experience. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and helpful and helped us navigate through the menu. My wife and I ordered the two aforementioned meals, as well as the tempura mashed potatoes. I really enjoyed the pork belly dish, although the scallion pancake served more as a thick slab of wrap as opposed to the crunchy, flaky marvels served at most Asian restaurants. My wife loved the Piggy-China-dish, which was a combination of Chinese sausage, scallion biscuits, egg and waffle. The dish relied a bit too much on sesame oil and was just a tad saltier than I had preferred. I did order a small side of the whipped peanut butter spread, only to realize that it was actually flavored butter, but peanut butter.

Seriously - nice job whoever came up with that. <br><br>For food I really wanted to try the goat because... well you get it. I ordered the Patty Melt and subbed out Slagel Farms for goat, medium. It was very tasty and if you close your eyes you'd be hard pressed to tell me it was goat. I can't decide if this makes me happy or disappointed, but either way it was definitely a stronger taste than your every day beef patty. Had a decent amount of grilled onions and a few large slices of pickle which added a nice balance. It was juicy and reminded me a bit of lamb, my only negative comment is I think the bread to meat ratio is a little off as at points I got huge mouthfuls of goat meat while at others I was rounding the corners of the bread. My girlfriend wanted breakfast and ordered the Bull's Eye French toast - which came with a egg cooked in the center of a waffle, fried chicken pieces, and strawberries.

It's a sesame cheddar biscuit served with Szechuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, blackberries and sunny eggs. The flavors may seem a bit confusing at first but it actually works pretty well together. The blackberries give a nice tartness and offer a good contrast to the spicy and salty Asian flavors. The oozing egg yolk adds a delightful richness to the dish<br><br>The girlfriend ordered the bull's eye french toast served with eggs, crispy chicken, and sweet onion brioche all drizzled with BBQ maple syrup. It definitely ate more on the sweeter side than savory (which I would've preferred) but overall a pretty tasty dish.<br><br>I wanted an iced coffee drink and the Thailander looked interesting on the menu.

The rest of the dish is completely balanced out with a vinegery shallot aoli and chickpea onion salad which was the much-needed refreshing element of the dish. The onions were a perfect complement to the fried food, and the chickpeas added the perfect amount of protein to the dish. To top it all off, the harissa vinegrette added another element of flavor blast to the whole meal. They give you 3 tostadas that are piled pretty high, and it was filling for $14. The fries were also well seasoned and shoe-string size. I would highly advise that you eat them as soon as they come because the quality deteriorates quickly as the fries get cold.

Most of the sandwiches are $12-14 (maybe one or two are $10-11), and they are a la carte. If you want a small order of fries it's an additional $2.50 or so!!<br><br>2. The second time here, I sat at a communal table with about 5 friends. Our food took some time to get to the table, and they completely forgot one of our orders. They brought her some soup while she waited (saying it was taking a while, but it didn't come out for another 35+ minutes--clearly they didn't even put it in). The most absurd part? They put the complimentary soup on the bill. We got it taken off but this was one of the most unprofessional dining experiences I've ever had (especially given the price point!!). <br><br>3. If you're looking for a brunch spot that serves your traditional savory tooth when you're at the height of your hangover, I would go elsewhere. 90% of the brunch menu involves some sort of shellfish and/or kimchi (of which I am allergic, the latter do not care for), and when I was there, in need of a hearty brunch dish, I was sorely disappointed I couldn't find even a traditional eggs benny on the menu.<br><br>4. Each time I was here I had to wait at least 45 minutes for a table--and to me, the wait was never worth it due to disappointing food, service, and atmosphere. <br><br>Honestly, you could wait the same amount of time, pay less money, and get more/better food for a dish at Au Cheval and be more satisfied.

I was torn between brussel sprouts with almonds and roasted root veggies as my side (everything is served ala carte) and the server recommended the sprouts.

Also luckily, my girlfriend doesn't like seafood and loves breakfast food, so the Little Goat fit perfectly for our needs. We arrived early on a Saturday morning at a little after 8am and almost got a table immediately. Quickly after we were seated though a line started forming at the door.<br><br>We sampled a variety of things from the menu, even the non breakfast ones. Such as the Smoke Pork and Toffee Milkshake. For those who think this sounds weird... there isn't actually chunks of pork in it, and the toffee sort of overwhelms the taste and texture of the shake. The smoked pork is more of a subtle thing. It was yummy, though not as unique as I had hoped but definitely packs a lot of toffee.<br><br>Soon after my Sloppy Goat sandwich arrived and I devoured it. It was big, sloppy, flavourful, and the roll was nice and squishy. I would agree with other reviewers that it is on the salty side. If you don't like salty food you won't love it... If you love sloppy joes you will love it... I loved it.<br><br>Next my girlfriend's Smoked Corn Beef Hash with Two Eggs arrived. The best part of this dish was the texture of the hash. Loved that the potato was shredded nice and thin, almost like little strings. Coupled with the smoked corn beef, and the fatty yolk... It definitely was a forkful of heaven.<br><br>And lastly, what I consider the best part of the meal, and perhaps one of the best things I ate on my trip to Chicago was the Crumpets with Chorizo Maple Syrup. The maple syrup was infused with the spice and the salt of the chorizo, which elevated something as amazing as maple syrup into something even grander. Having that poured on top of nice fluffy crumpets, and some gooseberries on the side for tartness to balance the sweet maple syrup was out of this world good. It really was the perfect dish.

Do you know what place was amazing and seated us right away? Little Goat. This was my first time coming here, and I had high expectations having previously dined at Stephanie Izard's Girl and the Goat. We were seated at the bar and we ordered brussels sprouts as an appetizer while we perused the gigantic menu of equally delicious-looking options. Perhaps there was a misunderstanding or the brussels sprouts were actually a side because they ended up coming at the same time as the rest of the food. <br><br>After lots of going back and forth, I finally decided to save the breakfast menu for a future Little Goat visit. I figured a burger would be a safe way to go, so I ordered one of the many options. I don't remember now which one it was, but it had a fried egg on the top. It was excellent. Not overly salty or overly anything. I would want to try something else next time, though. I was a bit disappointed by the brussels sprouts because they were very strong-tasting. I think it was some kind of oil or vinegar they were bathed in, but the taste was overwhelmingly salty. This is coming from someone who adds salt to things that were already salted, so you know I'm being serious when I say it was way too salty. <br><br>The price was right for us, which was great (about $30 for both of our meals). As I've already mentioned a few times in this review, I do intend to come back to Little Goat to try more.

Not the largest portion in the world, would be my only \"pork\" with it (get it? not beef? ha ha)<br><br>The korean burger was also pretty great--served with kimchi and bacon and spicy sauce. It was juicy and tasty and is another reason why the fusion menu here between classic American dishes with a little Asian fusion flare works so well for my tastebuds.

I came in at 8pm the other night and got seated at a corner booth but was ignored for 20 minutes so I left. I decided to give it another try so I went in for lunch today.

When the waiter saw the manager talking with him, she made sure he got extra service and again barely \"tolerated\" me. Both of these incidents made me feel there is a certain sense of classism pervading this establishment.

I won't be returning.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Between 4 and 5 stars I often don't know exactly which one to choose, but they are very similar. Anyways, the Little Goat. I enjoyed it so much. Being in Chicago occasionally for business (whish I had the pleasure so much more often, but hey, better than not at all, right?!) I am always interested in enjoyable breakfast joints, because when it's up to me that is my main meal for the day til dinnertime.<br>And being a fan of retro the Little Goat is just ideal. It has leather (fake? real? probably fake, but still classy!) cushioned seats, this time not in wine red, but in sh... (STOP right there!!!) anyways, in brown. <br>They go so far, or rather someone in the past did (and he or she did so often enough!) to cushion the entrance side walls with the stuff. Oh, the 50's (I THINK it is a 50's thing, I am not SURE...). <br>One wonders why the entrance walls, but then again, if you come here to eat on a weekend noonish it makes perfect sense, because plenty of other hungry brunchers stand in line with you and if it happens to be cold outside they won't stand \"in line\" but \"in crowd\" (a heard of little goats?), anyways, you are protected by the cushioned walls from being squeezed against a cold, hard surface. But luckily, alternatively, you can leave the counter people your cell phone number and go for a walk, which is nice, as the wait might be longer than 20 minutes.<br>The food is rich, interesting and I can afford it. Three great things. <br>I would like to put a spotlight on the \"Fat Elvis\" and also upload a photograph, as if I only describe it some of us would not believe it is true. So you get waffles with balls of peanut-butter, syrup, sliced bananas and tiny bacon specks-bits. I have not weighed it all, but as a rough estimate I guess that might be a 1000 calorie breakfast dish. You may think that can't be healthy, but if you eat apples and carrots til dinnertime you probably did yourself some good anyhow, because your soul had so much fun eating it and the psychology of food should NEVER be underestimated in questions of truly healthy nutrition. (If that does not convince: bananas contain plenty of potassium and pork is a great source of  Vitamin B... so there: justified!)<br>There is also a \"Little Goat Bread Bar\" right next to the diner, which is an even weirder place where you can have cocktails with your super-mega-ten(?) layer sandwich for breakfast and be incredibly chique whilst sitting and eating it. <br>There are cities in America where ideas like that might seem way over the top to me, because whilst I appreciate great food I still think other cultural achievements should come first and THEN we wash it down with a latte. <br>In Chicago however a wild bread-bar like this seems just the thing and not out of place, as the city has other cultural enrichment to offer as well, not only food or coffee. <br>Apparently Little Goat has a connection with Stumptown Coffee (sustainable coffee farming) which is certainly worth the thought and praise, and apparently they also have a roof garden, which I have not seen, but I understand you can drink and dance there for New Year, or rent it for your wedding. Cool, sounds very fun.<br>I waited, ate and was definitely satisfied, gladly coming back to do it all again.<br>Oh, one more thing: the wall paper is a psychedelic experience per se, limit staring at it to 2 (in words: \"two\") minutes maximum and only if you come in sober, or you might freeze up and they have to carry you out.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LW86slxn4fMgN9lmq1FP7w/348s.jpg", "caption": "Little Goat: the Fat Elvis breakfast... no lie, they really serve that and I really ate it!"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Visited Chicago in September and a friend of mine brought me and a couple others to Little Goat for brunch. <br>Such a cute fun restaurant, very laid back.

I'll focus mostly on my most recent dining experience here because it's most salient. It was a Saturday at around 6, which is prime time for dinner. The last time I had come to Little Goat, I had had a reservation, so I had reservations about coming without one (heh). We actually originally had put our names down for dinner at Au Cheval where the wait time was THREE HOURS. We were already hungry and Little Goat was also on our list of places to go in the West Loop, so we thought we would drop by to see if the wait time was better. And it was! Much to our excitement, we were seated immediately at the bar at Little Goat. Score! <br><br>Service: Service was a little bit spotty. Our waitress wasn't particularly attentive to us and, oddly, she absentmindedly filled my water glass, leaving my boyfriend's empty, then filled his maybe 10 minutes later. We were able to flag her for the check in a reasonable amount of time, so there were no other issues.<br><br>Food: I decided on the white fish chilaquiles for something different (normally I would head straight over to the all-day breakfast food part of the menu). Last time I was here, I got a portobello mushroom burger with shoestring onions on top and it was incredible. The chilaquiles were amazing, too, complete with salad on the top. I was surprised at first when these came out of the kitchen because it looked at first like it was just a bunch of salad! I really enjoyed my main entree. We also had ordered brussels sprouts, which were supposed to be an appetizer. I would have preferred to receive the brussels sprouts before our meal, but it came out as a side.
