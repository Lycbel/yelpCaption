I really wanted to like both of these dishes but they both lacked flavor. The tacos were some of the most flavorless tacos I've ever had in Chicago. They price them at 3 tacos for $6 but to get toppings such as guacamole, cheese, or sour cream, you pay $1 extra for each. We ended up adding a ton of their green hot sauce to add flavor.

This place is AMAZING and the portions are HUGE!!! Don't be like me and get so full that you slip into food coma. Don't even know where to begin...I've been having \"food dreams\" about this place since I left.<br><br>General Info:<br>I was in town and this was our first food stop. BYOB and cash only is an important tidbit to keep in mind. We did not have a hard time finding parking (Thursday evening) The seating has a nice indoor/outdoor feel with the windows. Staff was very friendly and attentive. We were there for awhile chatting but they never rushed us, which was nice. Service was quick and restaurant was very clean. My only complaint is that the tables were a bit tight for a group of our size (5) - they were shallow and tall persons in the group had knees bumping below the table. We're all friends though- so not a deal breaker. The restaurant was family friendly with a variety of age groups, which was nice as well.<br><br>Now the best part...the food!!<br>They start by giving you homemade chips and some salsa. The salsa is rather spicy, and I am a person who has a VERY high spice tolerance. That being said, use the sauce sparingly. We started our meal with the large Chifrijo (perfect size for our group). The dish was great with the homemade chips - the pork within was THE BOMB!! My husband and I both ordered the Steak Casado for our main entrees. The only complaint that I had is that the dish was draped with onions - neither of us are onion people. I wish that this had been disclosed on the menu so that we could have ordered without. We just pushed the mound onto a side plate and proceeded with our delicious meal. The fried egg on mine was overcooked a bit (more of a \"hard boiled\" style) and not runny as expected which was disappointing, but my husband's was done perfectly. The plantains were out of this world. All in all the food was great and I cannot wait to go back and get the same meal - with a runny egg! The servings were HUGE and we had lots of leftovers.<br><br>Everything was reasonably affordable - our portion of the bill with 20% tip (2 entrees and the appetizer) was about $50. Not bad at all, especially given the location. Notably, we just drank water. Our friend brought a bottle of wine but I do not believe they charged her for it.<br><br>**FUN FACT** this restaurant was on DDD!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wQctnJ5Sq6oA6WerHUpMWA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Chifrijo aka Costa Rican heaven in a bowl"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FTCXyxs811-1pQvexCOwNg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Steak Casado *note the onions not included in the menu description*"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "This is a great place to come in and grab a quick bite.

Since we didn't want to eat outside we were walked in through the kitchen to the dining room in the back of the restaurant.  I can forgive bad layouts (sometimes) but this was ridiculous - having to walk through the kitchen was just stupid.  There's no other word...it was stupid.  <br><br>Before I get to the food, there's some other factors that make this restaurant less than par.  The service was awful and it lacked any ounce of professionalism.  Our waiter was slow as molasses, chose to employ selective listening when taking our order and apparently thought it was decent and okay to slap his co-worker's ass while making crude jokes right in front of the customers.  It wasn't just that our waiter was rude and unclassy, but that he was inattentive.  All things combined, I'm even surprised we received our food at all.<br><br>Speaking food, I ended up getting the Guy Fieri special which included the pepito sandwich, small chifrijo and small oatmeal shake.  This special equated to $17 which was a little less than if you had ordered them separately.  I also got a side order of fried plantains (which the waiter had forgotten, or should I say neglected).  The fried plantains were actually my favorite part of the meal, oddly enough.  It's not to say that the other food wasn't good, but it wasn't the best Costa Rican food I've had.  <br><br>The famed chifrijo was undoubtedly flavorful, but it's not something I would to write home about.  The Pico de Gallo and avocado in this appetizer were great, and all the pork had fantastic flavor it was hard to chew.  I felt like I needed to go to the dentist after eating the pork just to ensure my teeth weren't broken.  Thankfully I had the oatmeal horchata shake, but even that wasn't as good as I expected it to be. It was very unique and good, but too grainy for my taste; it didn't quench my thirst - in fact, it made my thirst worse.  Lastly, the pepito sandwich: juicy at parts, and gamey at others.  Again, the flavor of the sandwich was on point, but it wasn't nearly as good as it should have been.  <br><br>Ultimately the cost of our meal was satisfactory, but I would have been much happier if everything had been satisfactory.  I'm just going to stick to my Costa Rican favorites here in the burbs.  I love Costa Rican food so again I'm sad that this didn't work out the way I'd have wanted it to.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gqqzdBvOoog71OM-6lf9yQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "Small side of fried plantains"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dgaZdHpsvy1-XlUFKhJbjQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Pepito sandwich"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OpPzyePOyxcGAd8jrszrZg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Small chifrijo"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Love this place!

However, it killed my tastebuds and I couldn't eat more than half. <br><br>My friends ordered the Pepito, the Milanesa, and the Steak Burrito. The Pepito is a staple and had no complaints; it had tons of meat and was cooked perfectly. The Milanesa was super delicious, but very messy.

My friend suggested maybe putting in a toothpick to hold it together: again, a simple fix. The last thing we ordered was the Steak Burrito, which was tasty, but we asked for (and paid for) sour cream, and yet we couldn't see it or taste it. <br><br>Overall, there were just one or two small critiques we had about everything we ate.

People, you want a jalapeno go to the store.  You can buy more than one jalapeno for a $1!!)<br><br>Here's the kicker...when we walked into the restaurant, me and the Hub knew what we were gonna order.  We took a look at the menu, and we saw it, and we ordered it.  (7.  They increased the price for the dish, but now, unlike before, the portions are just meh.)  What wasn't mentioned were these upcharges.  So when we got the bill, we felt we were overcharged.  That's when we were informed of the \"up\" charges.  And when we were discussing this with Henry, I told him that we didn't order anything that was an upcharge, except for the steak.  But he immediately argued that the Costa Rican rice and the jalapenos were upcharge menu items.  I was like, what?  why?  when?  and he exclaimed that it was clearly marked in the menu.  Um, really?  Because we didn't see it.  (After we left in disgust, we checked the menu and sure enough, at the top of the menu under the title for the dinners in small letters.  And no, the server did not mention an upcharge for these items.)<br> <br>This is when I realized that the success has gotten to this man's head and I guess the rest of the family.  It's too bad because in my first review, there was much mention of this feeling of family, even if you were a stranger.  Tonight, I just felt like, well, definitely not family.  And I think this is reflected in the cooking as well.  The Hub complained of an off taste with the meat on his plate, while I was looking for it on my plate.  Like I mentioned above, I miss the beans and I usually order my casado with white rice, but don't remember being told I had that option.<br><br>So, the honest truth is, the only thing I felt about this meal tonite was greed.  No longer the love that goes into the food, into the place, into the service.  I miss the Irazu of 12 years ago.  And while I'm sure they will not miss me, I hope they will remember what they used to be like and how Miriam used to cook.  I no longer taste the love, I no longer feel the love.  And thus, Irazu is no longer a restaurant that I love.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "When your menu comes with a basket of homemade chips, green salsa and a glass of cold water, I know it's going to be a good meal.

Restaurant is very popular with the locals and tourists and the evening and weekend crowds keep this place hoppin. They are a cash only establishment with a conveniently placed atm on the side. Fare is competitively priced, delicious and affordable. Modern and contemporary Latin music along with top English hits plays in the background. They have indoor and outdoor seating decorated in colorful paints with traditional artwork hanging all over the walls. Their outdoor patio is covered during the winter months and have heat lamps to keep you warm and toasty from the drafts which is nice. The covered patio extension is much needed as the interior resto is rather small and could accommodate at max 20 people. <br><br>How's the food? To sum it all up in one word...\"Amazing.\" Usually when I go to a restaurant and try a dish that turns out to be a winner, 95% of the time I stick with the dish and never try anything else for fear of disappointment. And the dishes I found to be top notch were the Casados which is a plate of marinated steak chopped thin and grilled laid on top of a bed of seasoned yellow rice (I like to order the upgrade and get mine spicy) topped with a runny fried egg, and a side of beets and a salad. Both my husband and I enjoy this dish very much and we order them with the Patacones (Tostones) app with ground black beans with garlic and oil sauce. One bite and OMG, the combination of these dishes were so tasty and addicting!!! I'm already looking forward to a future trip there! The oatmeal flavored shakes are worth a try too. They taste very similar to your standard horchata. <br><br>Side Tip: The summer months get pretty busy here and the wait times can challenge the most patient of people.

Food came quickly starting with the complimentary chips and salsa Verde. Every bite and sip was better than the last. The horchata was to die for. Rich and creamy with just the right amount of sweet and cinnamon. For starters we ordered the chorizo & potato, beef & potato, and chicken empanadas. So delicious! Topped off with house made pico de gallo and the perfect size for a shared appetizer. Next we had a generous bowl of freshly made guacamole, a great accompaniment to the empanadas, bright and balanced. For our entrees we split the skirt steak and pork chops. The skirt steak came grilled medium rare, was garnished with grilled cebollitas, and served with perfectly cooked rice and beans, a delicious cabbage salad topped with beets and tomato, and my favourite: fried plantains. The pork chops were split and flame grilled with just the right amount of char. They were well seasoned and topped with rich caramelized onions and served with the same accompaniments as the steak. After the meal, even though we were completely stuffed from the hearty portions,  the staff sent us a complimentary flan. One bite and we were hooked. It did not last long. Creamy and caramely, I would have gladly eaten it all myself. The perfect finish to the meal. <br>     Henry, the second generation owner of the establishment was so friendly. You could tell he really cared about the product he put out and the staff he employed. Make sure you know before you go that they are a cash only restaurant (there is an ATM on site with a $2 surcharge) and BYOB. This is definitely a must eat if you are anywhere near Wicker Park.

When checking out the previous yelp review, I was excited to go here. The best part about this place: BYOB. Honestly in Chicago and in a cool neighborhood like Wicker Park, that's a rare find.

I'm fairly certain they used ice cream to make this, it tasted like it was loaded up. This is not the \"overnight oats\" concoction you may have been expecting. As far as the food, I ordered the Pepito Sandwich w/ chicken. It was great. I think next time I will try one of their platters, just to get more food. I'm cutting out on bread so I just ate the meat and it really wasn't enough to fill up on. They also have this super-spicy green sauce they bring out upon request. I love spicy stuff so it was good, but its SOOO spicy so beware. The ambiance is fun, lots of bright colors and fun tropical type of atmosphere. Our waiter was nice, especially since we had a big group. Heads up: CASH PAY ONLY! Don't be surprised by this, show up prepared. They also didn't split our check between our group so we all just paid $20. Another great thing is they have un-metered street parking in the neighborhood about 2-3 blocks away.

I'd been wanting to try this restaurant for months, so when a work event led me to Chicago, I had to make a stop.<br><br>I felt uneasy as soon as the server placed chips and spicy green salsa on the table. Costa Rican cuisine is never spicy! The server noticed my skepticism after trying the salsa and reassured me that the staff at Irazu realized that this was inauthentic. Apparently, the restaurant's owner tells the waitstaff not to serve the hot salsa to Costa Rican patrons. However, apparently, non-Costa Rican patrons repeatedly requested chips and salsa, so there it was. People must confuse this place with a Mexican restaurant--many fellow Yelpers on here have. Guess what, people? Not all countries in Central America are just like Mexico! Believe it or not, there are cultural differences within the region, even when it comes to food!

The empanadas and yucca fries were delicious! I loved the spinach and cheese empanadas. I do wish that the yucca fries had come with ketchup (that's how they served them when I was in Costa Rica, usually with mayo too), but they were tasty with the garlic dip.<br><br>I ordered the shrimp and vegetable entree with gallo pinto, and my date ordered the casado with fish. Both entrees were great--generously sauteed with Salsa Lizano, which is a staple of Costa Rican cooking. The caramelized sweet plantains were just like my host family used to make--delicious!! It tasted like I was back in Costa Rica and I really really enjoyed it!!<br><br>To drink, my date had coffee with horchata and I tried the oatmeal shake--both were amazing!! My host families in Costa Rica used to serve me oatmeal-based drinks all the time, so turning that concept into a shake is really creative, not to mention delicious!

We were in heavy duty wedding planning mode and decided to pick up burritos at Irazu.  We noticed their sign that said venue space.  We looked at the two spaces: one that accommodates smaller parties and one for larger parties.  We looked at the space, loved it and put down the deposit (just a small amount compared to other venue space).<br><br>Everything we wanted was at Irazu: delicious food, great prices, BYOB and something low maintenance.  The food package was perfect and delicious. It was great because my final count wasn't due until just 2 or so days before the event.  This was helpful because it allowed for last minute changes.  We had enough food for everyone.  The food was delicious, authentic and a big wow! We loved that it was BYOB, particularly because we were going all out with full bar for our 7 hour wedding the next day.  We also added one of Irazu's greats mixers to make fantastic drinks.  Oh and there was no corkage fee! <br><br>Irazu has two spaces.  The bigger space is what worked for me better since I had about 75 people.  The space was a dance studio across the street.  I liked it because it was a big space and just simple.  The colorful dishes from Irazu was the perfect touch to make the space come alive.   The other space is smaller and more festively decorated.  <br><br>It was so great to work with Henry.  From the very beginning, he showered us with genuine care.  That's what made us make our mind up so quickly (and that Irazu is one of our favorite restaurants).  He answered my questions back quickly and was accommodating to my needs.  <br><br>My entire family/friends were raving about how amazing the rehearsal dinner was.  This includes people that never even had Costa Rican food before.  When we talk about our wedding, now over a year later, people still bring up Irazu!  And our friends that live in Chicago go there all the time now. <br><br>The funny thing is that we booked our rehearsal dinner before we figured out where we were going for our honeymoon.  We ended up going to Costa Rica- so it was even more perfect that part of our wedding celebration took place at Irazu. <br><br>It was simply perfect!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Excellent food.

It seemed like a combination of Mexican, Cuban, and Puerto Rican cuisines. We ordered the oatmeal shakes, yuca and mojo, and chifrijo. If you love Mexican horchata, then you must get the oatmeal shake. It's a dense milkshake form of horchata and it's awesome. Beware for those who are lactose intolerant because you'll need a lactaid. The chifrijo is chicharron and frijoles combined. If you aren't familiar with those words, imagine a burrito bowl from Chipotle with fried pork fat.

I officially love sweet empanadas. The crust was perfectly flaky with a bit of a crunch to it without being burnt at all. Definitely don't miss out on the empanadas if you come here! They're also a very affordable $3 a pop. I recommend ordering a few of these to share as an appetizer like we did.<br><br>Now, let's talk the oatmeal shake. It reminds me a lot of a frozen slushie version of horchata, except with a smoother consistency than a slushie; it wasn't really icy at all except for toward the end where we actually had to add a little bit of water so we could enjoy the rest of it. There's not way in heck I'm going to share the next time I come here because I want to savor one of these babies all on my own! Even though it tasted so good, I am still a little curious if the taste could be improved by additional fruit (like mango). Perhaps I'll find out next time!

Both were good. The spinach filed up half the empanada whole the cheese filled up the other half. This made it difficult for sharing, as we cut them in half. I had never had a sweet empanada and the plantain was a great option. It was $2.95 for each one. <br><br>We also ordered the oatmeal shake made with milk based on Yelp reviews and other advice.

If was mostly oatmeal at the end, so we added a little water so it was possible to sip with the straw. <br><br>I got the veggie sandwich on french bread, which had eggplant, avocado, black bean paste, lettuce, and another vegetable. It was only $6 and was pretty filling, which is saying something considering I was hungry from traveling all day. <br><br>The only thing keeping this from a five star review is that 1) it's cash only, which is fine if you're prepared (they list that in huge lettering on the menu so you know before you order anything). Also, 2) the ends of my lettuce leaves were seriously wilted/slightly browned. After such an awesome experience otherwise, this was a bit of a damper to see hey hadn't used fresh ingredients.

Each one is big enough to share and you have the option to get them in 3, 5, 7 or 9.

The only difference is that the Casado has a fried egg with no bell peppers and El Tico has bell peppers and no fried egg. The fried egg was too cooked for my liking, I was hoping it would be a runny sunny side up egg, but it was almost like a hard boiled sunny side up egg. Both dishes were both bland, no flavor, or anything. I had to add a little bit of green sauce to make it taste like anything.My friend got the yuca fries as a side and they were pretty good. Nice and crispy and came with an oil based garlic sauce. As for dessert I got the oatmeal shake and it was delicious. It was like a rice pudding, horchata milk shake. I would definitely be back to get it. Overall, I can't say I have a desire to go back and try their other dishes. <br><br>Service: It was quick and our server was super helpful.

Not only was he patient, and he didn't even have that \"I'm just being patient right now\" attitude, he was so pleasant and happy to help and provide his recommendations. <br><br>The food, however, was just a 3 star situation for me. I had a spinach and cheese empanada, which was great but not awesome, and the El Tico. My ribeye was definitely overdone and lost its flavor and the rest of the meal was just a bit on the dry side. The chips in the beginning also needed more dip than a bottled sauce, but the guacamole we ordered later to help them out was delicious.

Irazu recommends adding plantains (which I generally am not a fan of) and I have to agree. The sweet plantains mixed with the savory everything else... they're really on to something. <br><br>Other things you need to make sure you get down on at Irazu:<br>- Famous oatmeal shake, choose chocolate and splurge on the soy, it honestly tastes better than the regular milk. <br>- BYOB... so cost effective when dining, make sure you take advantage.<br>- That freakin' delicious salad with beets and hearts of palm.

 2012 was the warmest winter ever...thanks farmers almanac for getting it wrong!!!<br><br>I can hardly wait to come back here and enjoy my own burrito and a spiked pitcher of oatmeal shake.  This place was so worth it and I am glad to be removing the bookmark for Irazu from my Yelp.  You are now on my list of restaurants I will be coming back to in the future!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nzsYKMFJcGZytMuFXSKLTA/348s.jpg", "caption": "Papito Sandwich...same one Guy F from Triple D liked!!!"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HvLYwpHS6hhxlupAqz4Cdg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Veggie Burrito with steak added!

Keep in mind this place is CASH ONLY. The place itself is a little on the small side, so it would be good for smaller groups. <br>They have a nice patio area that is heated during the wintertime. <br><br>So what to order?<br><br>- CHIFRIJO. They have a small and a large portion. The small is actually enough to share among 2-3 people or can be satisfying as an entree for one. Chifrijo is basically rice, beans, lizano sauce, with pork bits and avocado. This dish is THE reason I keep coming back. <br><br>- Ceviche. I'm a fan. It's pretty consistent here. I don't always order ceviche, since I have chifrijo mostly, but would definitely recommend as an appetizer.<br><br>- The Dinners here are pretty good. i've had the Casado before, which is full-out complete Costa Rican meal. Standard rice, beans, plantains, meat. Good value for the portion size.<br><br>- Actually, I prefer ordering the empanadas over the dinners. They come in 3, 5, 7, or 9, so they are good to share. The empanadas are crispy with a delicious center and come in a variety of flavors. My go-to empanadas are spinach and cheese or sweet plantain. <br><br>- Last but not least, the Oatmeal shake is HIGHLY recommended. You can either make it with milk, water, or soy. I typically go with milk. I'd say the Oatmeal shake is similar in taste to Horchata, but something about the texture that adds to it.

That was until I noticed Irazu's name on a \"Best Burrito\" project by 538. 538 is a website specializing in advance statistical analysis in areas such as Economics, Politics, Sports, Science, and a broader \"Life\" Category. Although Irazu's burrito didn't quite make the cut as the best burrito, the mere consideration in the best burrito bracket caught my attention. Thank God. <br><br>The burritos are great, sure, and the sweet plantains are excellent, too. That said, the oatmeal shake is \"bae\" (as my generation likes to put it - look it up, old folks). <br><br>It's that good. Sweet, cinnamon-y, but light in its own way. Go here, try it. I'd also recommend delivery, as they are always prompt and the food is always quality.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Love. LOVE. Staff is friendly, food is phenomenal, BYO is a plus.

I had never tried Costa Rican food prior to Irazu, but I am definitely impressed! Their empanadas were insanely awesome, especially the cheese one.

I think we got the leftover yuca from the bottom of the deep fryer ;( The bf n I decided to split the pepito sandwich, since we had appetizers galore. It was tasty, and reminded me of an Italian beef sandwich. <br>The highlite of the place? DEFINITELY the oatmeal shake! It was like a mixture of rice, vanilla, cinnamon, oats, and milk.

 And for that matter, the dish I got, which was $11, really shouldn't have been more than $8 or $9 (max).  I get the sense that Irazu is milking the area and media notoriety more than just a bit.  But I will give them props for keeping some less expensive items on the menu (like a $5 quesadilla).  <br><br>Another thing that confused me about Irazu was the lack of tasty, zippy or otherwise remarkable sauces, etc.  When we asked if there was anything interesting in the way of dipping sauce we might have with one of our appetizers, we were told that the salsa they served with the chips on the table was basically it.  They had some optional garlic oil (mojo), but that wasn't particularly flavorful as it's just garlic and oil for the most part.  IMO, making a few interesting sauces and condiments available would go a long way.  <br><br>At the end of the day, things were generally tasty and there was no issue with quality.  Sitting in what amounts to a big enclosed patio and paying relatively premium prices ($15 per person for lunch not including beverages and tip) for lackluster service and missed opportunities for engagement and rapport are another matter.  At the very least, I hope the owners read this and realize that people who are not eating their meat specialties might enjoy some extra pops of flavor -- and paying any up-charge for a \"spicy\" option on dishes over $10 doesn't reflect an appreciation for Irazu's customers.  Charge me a dollar or two for a pair or trio of flavorful specialty sauces on the side, and I'm cool.  Charge me a few quarters to sprinkle some hot pepper in my food and you've kinda lost my respect for your priorities.  <br><br>I miss the \"old\" feel of Irazu -- before the hype, and when it felt like they were anxious to please customers by trying to meet their needs.  But as it stands right now, I'm afraid the vibe I got this go-around was that it was less about me and more about them.  This extends from the \"Cash Only\" decree from our server after putting down a credit card (which I still fail to understand the rationale for other than profit margins), to the lack of any interest in getting the least bit creative about trying to meet a simple request for something other than the salsa on the table (which we already had with chips) to dip unseasoned yucca in.  <br><br>Bottom line:  I don't think you'll get a bad meal here, but you there may be some bumps in the road along the way.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I finally decided to give this place a try on a Saturday night with my sister.  The place was crowded, so there was about a 35 minute wait.  The hostess took down my name and number and informed me that I'll receive a text when our table is ready.  There wasn't much of an area to wait, so we just sat in our car.  About 25 minutes later, my phone started buzzing and our table was ready.  Sweet...didn't have to wait the full 35 minutes!!<br><br>Whoever came up with the design of the place is a genius!  They made use of the little area they had by creating a dining area in front of the restaurant.  It was covered with wind proof plastic and electric heaters for warmth.  It was pretty comfortable and warm for it being below 20 degrees.<br><br>My sister and I were excited and wanted to try everything they suggested.  So excuse our fattiness, but we ordered:<br><br>Appetizers:<br>- Veggie Black Bean Soup: black bean soup with tomatoes.  Only got this dish because my sister wanted some soup, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would.  I enjoyed the difference in the texture from the tomatoes and difference in flavor from the lime.<br><br>- Empanadas: beef and potatoes, spinach and cheese, and zucchini.  I enjoyed the beef and potatoes the most out of the three.  It had tons of flavor and the beef wasn't dry.  The zucchini empanada was bland and the spinach and cheese had too much cheese.  Enough said.   <br><br>Drinks:<br>- Oatmeal Milkshake: they offer this with soy, water, or regular milk.  This was hands down one of the best milkshakes I had ever tasted.  The texture of the milkshake was blended to perfection; it wasn't too thick.  It tasted like an oatmeal horchata.  Delicious!!<br><br>Entrees:<br>- Steak Pepito Sandwich: this sandwich was so yummy.  I appreciated that the french bread it was served on was soft and not hard.  Most french bread sandwiches I have tried are always toasted and way too hard to eat (not my cup of tea.)  I also liked that the steak wasn't overcooked.<br><br>- Tilapia Casado:  like other people said, you can definitely share this entrée with two people (unless you are super hungry and/or didn't order anything else off the menu.)  It comes with beans, rice, cabbage salad, sweet plantains, and your choice of meat (in our case we got the tilapia.)  I just thought this was ok, the tilapia was too dry for my liking and didn't have much flavor.  Everything else was mediocre, so this dish was nothing to rave about.   <br><br>Overall, I enjoyed my food and the service here.  Everyone was nice and friendly.  I definitely will be returning just for the oatmeal milkshake.  One tip: bring cash, its cash ONLY.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5xQuP-Ycc_935MN1VgbcJA/348s.jpg", "caption": "Casado - Tilapia"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/p9poFOwVFOM12gyS-tEByQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Steak Pepito Sandwich"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rlzd8-YBapwahkv0VGgB2Q/168s.jpg", "caption": "Oatmeal Milkshake (Shorter One is with Soy)"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Love this place!

Needless to say, I don't plan to go back.<br><br>If Irazu wants to appeal to people not native to Chicago (i.e. can't stand cold weather), they should keep their seating area at room temperature and not let the outside temperature have an effect.

Joined with a platter of Yuca frita with that phenomenal garlic sauce, it was lunch for two around $20.00.<br><br>The ambiance is very much like stopping in at little street cafe in San Jose. They've even managed to create all the street noise with the truck traffic, the hipsters on their noisy scooters, and the Blue Line el across the street where the trains seem to pass every two minutes. So don't hang outside here if you are looking for quiet. It's not. But you can always dine inside if it's too much of a distraction.

The ceviche was good but nothing special. The huevos con chorizo was extremely bland and I didn't like the texture of the eggs mixed with the chorizo. In fact, the description said it would have eggs scrambled with \"spicy\" sausage. There were no sausages in the dish! It just looked like ground beef mixed with scrambled eggs that had absolutely no taste. Considering how much of a weak sauce I am when it comes to spicy food, me calling this dish mild might be the understatement of the year.<br><br>Highlights of the meal were the empanada and the oatmeal shake. The oatmeal shake just tasted like a thicker version of an horchata.

But I think many people feel this sentiment (just look at all the reviews!), so I'm going to leave my first tip early: I came by with a friend last Saturday night for dinner around 9. We were able to be seated within 60 seconds, maybe less, but the host told us the last group had been waiting for an hour--so timing is key, and I'd recommend just before or just after peak hours to avoid the wait. The alternative to that is order delivery--you'll definitely have a bit of a wait, but nothing too unreasonable. I was in the neighborhood and the food was delivered to my friend's within 45 minutes of placing the order--I just ordered it about an hour before we were planning to eat, so it worked out perfectly. Take heed to this advice and do the same if you're looking for delivery. There is a $15 delivery order minimum, though, so just make sure you're cognizant of that as you're picking and choosing from all the delicious sandwiches, burritos, sides, and such.<br><br>Next tip? If you're dining in you should know that this place is BYO! If you didn't come prepared, though, no worries. The shakes they've got here really will bring all the boys to the yard. Most flavors are fruity, but they've got a traditional chocolate and vanilla, too. You can order shakes with one flavor or, for a couple bucks more, spice it up and mix two.<br><br>As for food, its hard to know where to start, because its really all so delicious. Definitely don't fill up on the free chips and salsa before you get your meal--you're going to need plenty of room for all of the delicious menu items. I've split the Chifrijo with friends on a couple occasions and it's delish. The empanadas are also amazing. My favorites are the plantains and beef & potatoes. For the main dish, my go-to is the Vegetarian Burrito with sweet plantains thrown in. I usually can't finish it in one sitting since it's packed with so many good veggies, beans, rice, etc. <br><br>In summary: Go. Go eat here now.

Couldn't even be seated to enjoy the food.<br>My friends and I have a Friday night supper club and we frequent places in the Bucktown/Wicker Park area. Usually we're a group of 4-8. Decided to try Irazu on the recommendation of one in the group, as they were known for good food and a casual atmosphere. <br>I'm a very reasonable person. And a lot of the negativity directed in the review that follows is because the restaurant doesn't live up to a \"reasonable person\" standard. The story: I arrived very early, 30 min prior to the rest of my party, and was advised by a female hostess that when more than 50% of our party arrived we could be seated. OK, absolutely understood. So I bided my time. Eventually, all of our party except one person arrived. There was turnover at the host stand and a male host now advised us he would not seat us until our entire party was present. Mind you, it was a Friday night and there were open tables. In my opinion, being one person short on a large party when there is no wait is not an unreasonable request to be seated. But the male host refused to budge. Given the inability to accommodate us while we waited for one more person, our group decided to go elsewhere. Upon telling this to the host, he dismissed us and clearly was not bothered that we took out business elsewhere. Bottom line: inflexible seating policy and not good for groups unless the entire party is present. I can't comment on the food because I didn't eat. However, given our poor experience with something as simple as the host stand, I assure you I won't be going back or recommending this establishment to others.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "We ordered an oatmeal + blackberry shake, a mamey shake, empanadas, chicharrón, and casada with tilapia.<br><br>Our server seemed a bit stretched thin, he had a lot of tables that sat down at the same time, but he was professional and courteous so it did not affect our visit.<br><br>The shakes and empanadas stood out from the rest.

Seriously, you can really taste the difference between good, fresh cinnamon and the regular stuff. Irazu opts for the former, God blessem.<br><br>Dinner? Awesome. Got the Pepito sandwich--steak with some melty cheese, sauteed onions and beans. Split some excellent guac and chips with my buddy and had a perfect and so very filling meal. Even though they implement liberal use of chopped cilantro on top of their guacamole and cilantro is my mortal enemy I still love it. Good on you, Irazu. My friend got the potato tacos and the plate was huge! Lots of toppings and sides. Perfect for veggie eating friends out there. <br><br>The inside space is pretty small which means there can be a wait for a table when it's cold and rainy and the patio isn't open. It's cool, though, because the food is so good you'll be happy to hang tight. I saw a lady next to us get an oatmeal shake to go while she waited for her table. That is SUCH a good call if you're starving or just can't wait for to mainline some oats. She is smart.

Usually they get it mostly right, but I have to say that my newest experience here was a little different. I asked the inexperienced waiter what the sauce was on my plate, and he said he didn't know... Ok, maybe do some research and find that out when a customer asks? It seems like much of the waitstaff here is now young and inexperienced, which is slightly different than how things were when it was more of a mom and pop operation. <br><br>Secondly, it was very loud in the restaurant. There was a table full of tecate-drinking young ladies that was extra loud, plus, everyone was speaking loudly to be able to hear themselves over them as a result. Compounding this were crashing noises from the back kitchen that were very loud, and the fact that the restaurant has nothing but flat reflective surfaces means that sometimes you just wish things were a little quieter so you could actually have an intimate conversation there.

A few weeks ago I had a reservation through open table and I needed to adjust it.  I called them because the open table app couldn't make the adjustment that I was needing. I thought the restaurant may be able to help and that it was at least worth asking. If they said they couldn't help I would have just canceled (no big deal). I called and one of the rudest men answered and immediately told me that they can't help me since I booked through open table and that I needed to call open table. I have never had that happen. It was a simple question. Not to mention one that I tried to work out with open table first. The restaurant knows If they have the space to add a person.  I called open table and explained and even they were confused as to why I was told to call them. I called Irazu back and they still wouldn't help me so I canceled. This last time the man working as the host (pretty sure it was the same guy) was very unpleasant. I asked about sitting outside and he told me that \"just because you have a reservation doesn't mean you can sit outside\". I was just asking if it was possible. A simple, \"I'm sorry we don't have the space\" would have been fine. He then sat us and just pointed at a section of the restaurant. I asked \"which one?\".  He replied \"the one with the water\".  Very short and rude. I understand that it's busy but a smile goes a long way. And to top it off. I received an email from open table a couple of days later asking why I hadn't gone to Irazu for my reservation. The restaurant marked us as no shows. I definitely do not no show on reservations. I was there. Open table solved that problem with the restaurant but it still bothered me after my experience. That's the last straw for me I think. Delivery only from now on.

Justin was so wonderful to work with in the months leading up to the dinner and I really appreciated just how genuine and helpful he and the rest of the staff were. The owner Henry also made a point to say hello and check in with us during dinner and really made us feel special. And!

I started to realize within 5 min of having the appetizer that the waiter misinformed me, so I asked him again and he said no MSG is used. I ended up not eating anything and I brought my entree home to my fiancé. On my walk home, I called the restaurant and asked if they used MSG and they put me on hold to ask the cooks. Not even a minute later they're back and tell me the rice, their homemade sauce and something else has it in it and that they can't guarantee no cross contamination. I said thank you and hung up. That's all it took; a quick run to the kitchen to check with the cooks. Don't mess around food allergies people, and to my waiter, if I ate my steak entree I would've had to go to the hospital because then my reaction is too bad to handle with pepto bismol. <br><br>My girlfriends like this place and my fiancé like the leftovers but they use MSG and the waiter we had was an idiot and I had an allergic reaction due to his incompetence and laziness.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The highlight - Chifrijo!!<br><br>I could literally eat the whole thing by myself.

Highly recommended.<br><br>I had the \"onioned steak dinner\" which was tasty, though a bit too well-done for my liking, though I asked for a side of Costa Rica's famous Linzano sauce (a bit similar to Worcestershire sauce), which helped it out. Also, I should have noticed that it would come with patacones when we ordered the appetizer, but you can't have too many of them, and I'm counting them as a fruit even though their being fried must turn that positive into a negative. Make sure you spend the extra cents on the gallo pinto (\"spotted rooster\"), which contains no rooster (though I have to believe that the rooster means it helps wake you up when eaten at breakfast), but is a Costa Rican spotted delight of black beans, rice, some onion, garlic, herbs & spices, and a little of Linzano. Others have remarked on the oatmeal shake taste sensation, and I concur. Nothing oatmealy about it, though it makes a great thickener, and I'm a huge fan of horchata; the two have similar flavors.<br><br>Of course, we filled-up too much on appetizers, but that gave us an extra meal to take home.

Everything we had was incredible, but I couldn't enjoy it because of the experiences that led up to it. We ordered pretty much the same meals as we had the last time and they were outstanding. Steak was cooked to perfectly and the sauce that comes out with the chips is soooo good. I actually asked if I can purchase some to take home with me. <br><br>I would definitely recommend Irazu to everyone that I know and actually have to a few co-workers already.

There was a very long wait due to the great weather we were having.....so after a about a 45 min wait...we decided to jump at the fist table that popped up inside. We were given chips and there was two kinds of salsa in squeeze bottles at our table. I'm not a big fan of salsa in squeeze bottles, due to the fact that half of it ends up on the table. I wasn't impressed by either salsa, but found that both were decent. <br><br>We ordered a number of empanadas and I found the chicken empanadas to be awesome. It went really well with the red salsa. My vegetarian friends ordered a plantain empanadas which i found too sweet for my liking. We also ordered guacamole, tostones, and a black bean dip for the table. We were all getting full from gorging on the spread. Everyone really loved the black bean dip. I could fill a bath tub up with the stuff and eat my way out of it. The tostones also were really good when eaten with the black bean dip. I found the guacamole to be a okay. I've had better at Mexican restaurants. <br><br>I ordered the steak which was served with rice and a cabbage salad. I found the steak to be super salty. Almost to the point of being inedible. The cabbage salad was also a bit bland. Others at the table really enjoyed their food. One raved about her chile relleno, and another loved her grilled vegetable platter. <br><br>The bill came back to be about $20 a head after eating like pigs......so its a great option for a group of friends...however just realize you might have to wait in a long time for a table.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Straightforward and delicious Costa Rican cuisine. <br><br>byo and super lively any night if you're dining in.

La comida tipica en Costa Rica is known as the \"Casado.\" What is it? This is a commonly known Costa Rican dish which consists of beans, rice with finely diced red bell peppers and onions, fried plantains (usually platanos maduros), a cabbage salad with tomato and carrot, and your choice of meat (usually pollo, fish, pork, or rib eye steak with grilled onions). La carne (the meat) que viene con el Casado is grilled or sautéed, but never fried. We ordered the Casado with rib eye and it was flavorful and tender. All the sides complemented the rib eye nicely and made for the perfect amalgamation. This dish is worthy of FIVE stars. My husband ordered the grilled steak, and he thought it also deserved FIVE stars. He said the grilled steak was incredibly flavorful, super tender and one of the best cuts of meat he has had in a while. He enjoyed the yellow rice, beans, sweet plantains (also known as platanos maduros or platanos dulce) and small salad. If you have had the pleasure of exploring different Latin American cuisine, such as, Colombian, Cuban, Barbados, Dominican, Peruvian and Puerto Rican, you will be happy that you tried Irazu's cuisine. It definitely offers up tropical Carribean flavors with a zest of unique twists. Latin Caribbean cuisine is a combination of local and imported ingredients and culinary methods that melds cultural traditions and heritage. It is a sensational blend of striking colors, tropical tastes, aromatic herbs and spices and exciting flavors, sure to leave your taste buds craving more.<br><br>The Chef, Miriam, opened the restaurant in 1990, and it is going stronger than ever. My compliment to Chef Miriam for getting it RIGHT every single time. Todo siempre esta muy delicioso. Irazu has a great following from people of all ages and from all over the city (and in some cases, suburbanites, who are not afraid and open-minded enough to explore authentic Costa Rican cusine in the heart of the City). I have a friend who is \"afraid\" to come to the City, but I know not every suburbanite feels this way about the city. There are many outstanding restaurants in the City, including, Irazu.<br><br>A very, very long time ago my husband took a trip to Costa Rica. He loved the country, the food, the culture, the beautiful rain forest, and the warmth of the people. He agreed that the food here is as authentic as it gets and it reminded him of all the foods that he ate while in Costa Rica. NOTE: As is usually the case with most \"mom and pop\" Latin restaurants they do not accept any plastic of any kind. Be sure to bring a nice red wine to complement your dinner (especially if you are eating steak or chicken). They have an awesome selection of vegetarian dishes, so vegetarians are bound to find something great here. We would have rated Irazu with five stars, but the wait was crazy long, it is cash only (which is a deal breaker in my book), and the service was super slow. Our server was hospitable, but not overly attentive. Our water glasses were kept filled and we were given extra napkins (without asking) which we appreciated. Did we enjoy the food? Was the price-point reasonable? Was the service hospitable? Was the food authentic in flavor? Si, si, si to all these questions.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Just go.

We asked her for:  simple, unique, cheap and not full of drunk college kids. She and Irazu both delivered. <br><br>We were initially hesitant to ride back up from an earlier trip starting the in Loop, but in hindsight it was the best move we made all week. <br><br>Irazu is a tiny place. It looks like it could have been a coffee stand at one point except someone figured out they could cover and heat a giant patio out front. It works perfectly but be warned there was a 45 min. wait when we went and, as I'm told, there often is.<br><br>Once we got there, Irazu's uber-sweet hostess (wanted to be her BFF she was so nice) sent us down a block to the Green Eye, a good little bar. We left our name, traveled down there, noshed some chips and had a brew, then headed back. <br><br>We were seated quickly and, despite it being cold and windy, their flame heaters did a fine job of making the enclosed \"patio\" warm. It took us a bit to decide on food, though I knew there was an oatmeal shake in our future no matter what. Honestly, I doubt you could go wrong with anything on the menu. Hell, I'd come back just to try everything on the list.<br><br>The night we went, my husband opted for a $15 combo that included a sandwich, appetizer and the infamous oatmeal shake. I ordered two tacos. Chips came gratis and we over-indulged in a basket and a half.<br><br>Our appetizer, Chifrijo, came out first. It was a nice-sized, sharable bowl of hot rice with black beans, diced veggies (think salsa w/o the sauce base), fresh avocado and fried pork pieces layered on top. It also had what I take to be Irazu's special sauce swirled on top. Let it be known I could have eaten JUST this with the chips. God, it was good. Fresh and delicious.<br><br>The oatmeal shake came out next. This was the only \"wahh?\" part of the meal. The shake rocked but next time I'd ask for it to come last. We wanted to savor it more as a dessert than a drink. It was fantastic though and much like a giant blended rice pudding. No lumps, no whipped cream...nothing weird. Just a bit of allspice and cinnamon swirled in.<br><br>Entrees: The hubs said a steak sandwich, per his meal deal, was great. I had a bite and while it was a little \"safe\" for me, it was indeed good. I opted for two chicken Taco Ticos. They came rolled (not folded), fried and topped with fresh, shredded cabbage, mayo, a little ketchup and that awesome sauce. Again, maybe it was because we were on vacation, but I've never actually had good cabbage nor have I ever enjoyed mayo-until now. The toppings were a great salty-sweet addition to the tacos though. It worked.<br><br>Like many here have said, we had leftovers. Lots of leftovers. So, not only is Irazu a place to get fresh food on the cheap, but if you nab an appetizer, chances are you can make a second meal out of it.

 I'm leaving!).<br><br>Secondly - OK, suppose you convince me of some legitimate reason why you shouldn't accept credit cards (good luck).  Well, don't you think it would be a good idea that you advertised this situation fully?<br><br>(Partly shame on me here - because I had eaten here at least 2-3 times in the past but did not remember that they were cash-only.  I think I can be forgiven since it is less than once a year). <br><br>When we were close to being done my wife noticed a very small placard tucked away in the corner of the dining room that said something like \"cash only\" or \"no credit cards\" (can't remember which).  I mean, this sign was small - maybe the size of a large postcard, and tucked into the corner near the dish rack.  I realized I didn't have the cash on me and verified with the waiter that they only take cash (not even debit!).<br><br>So - now there are two reasons that I am upset at how they handle their (ridiculous)  cash-only policy.<br><br>1) I checked all over the restaurant.  Besides the little sign I mentioned above, there is a small sticker on the cash register that says \"Cash-only\".  Neither of these things were really visible when entering the restaurant and being seated and their policy was not listed on the menus or called out by the wait staff.  And yet, as I surveyed the rest of the signage at the restaurant I was bombarded with info about their BYOB policies.  Don't you think advertising your methods of payment should be as important as your BYOB signage?<br><br>2) When I asked the waiter if there was an ATM around, I was pointed to one at the front of the restaurant that wanted to charge me a few dollars fee.  So - not only don't they take your credit cards, but they encourage you to use their ATM, which they certainly get a cut of.  No wonder they don't advertise their cash-only policy!<br><br>I walked 1/4 mile to the Walgreens at Western and used the ATM there instead.<br><br>I'll probably forget if we every go back that it is cash-only...it would just be nice if they tell you that before they seat you, so I can go and get cash before my meal instead of running out and ruining my dining experience.<br><br>EDIT: To respond to the restaurant's comments below (aside: why does Yelp allow businesses to comment, but then not allow a response?).  Perhaps your menus on the site say \"Cash Only\", but the menus that were in the restaurant that  day did not.  Neither my wife nor I could find anything on them, when specifically looking.  <br><br>Just wanted to add that I checked the historical internet archive for you posted menus.  And it looks like even as recently as June 5th, you had a version of the menu without the front-side \"CASH ONLY\" piece as is displayed on your menu now (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F19JuQPd&s=365d22979d6a817122207d67e40504240b81e2379894e033219163768470dfe6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/19JuQPd</a>).<br><br>My guess is you still have old menus laying around that don't say this.  I appreciate that you are making an effort to state it on the menus now - but your servers should also be pointing this out.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I finally stopped into Irazu for merienda (spanish word for a snack before dinner) and I had a charming experience.

Thanks to the beautiful election day weather, we were able to sit outdoors in the patio. While it's very nice to be outdoors, I wasn't crazy about this patio. Not because of anything the restaurant did, but because the Blue Line El tracks are across the street. When a train passes, it's so loud, you really can't hear the other person talk. And when there are two trains, you can forget conversation entirely. So, while I really appreciate the 70 degree weather and the nice breeze, this is a very noisy patio, and I would probably avoid it in the future.<br><br>We were the only people at the patio, and we got service very quickly. I don't think we'd been sitting for 60 seconds before we got water, chips, and two kinds of salsa. ButI've been jonesing for guacamole something fierce, and I starved myself in preparation for this lunch, I ordered guacamole. You can get regular or spicy, so I went for the spicy. Spicy means there are chopped chilies at the side of the mound of guac, which comes with tomatoes. I thought the guac was kind of thin, almost watery, and didn't have much flavor. Adding the chilis definitely perked it up, but it still seemed kind of thin.<br><br>Leon and I are both vegetarians. I ordered the vegetarian burritos, and did not get the extras added (mushrooms, zucchini,or something else), which cost extra. I thought the veggie burrito was outstanding, very tasty, warm, and fresh. I did add some of the red salsa, but just because I like a kick of extra flavor.<br><br>Leon ordered the veggie sandwich, and he loved it. It had black beans, lettuce, avocado, tomatoes, and I don't know what else. I might try that next time.<br><br>Leon also ordered a shake, which is made in the Costa Rican style. It was oatmeal with mango, the special of the day. I took a spoonful, and boy was it good. I never imagined you could make a shake with oatmeal. I could definitely taste it, and I liked it. That was the only taste I got - I think Leon would have slapped my hand, if I'd tried to take more.<br><br>I finished with a cup of regular coffee.

The burritos are just immense, the patacones are plentifully plated, the shakes tall. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that given the quality and quantity that they could double the price on half their items without losing many customers. Especially in Wicker Park.

The First Mate's log of the final voyage of the S.S. Veggie Supper Club from October 14 (or 20, who's counting) 09. Here are some of the excerpts that would be interesting to modern audiences: <br><br>--- <br><br>DAY ONE: Travelling deep into the heart of \"Costa Rica\" we have come to the village of Irazu. It might seem close to home to many of the crew, just off the Western Blue Line port on Milwaukee Avenue, but it is a different world. The natives are friendly, accommodating our motley, rain drenched, crew of about a dozen at a table near the back of the village for their traditional meal - I believe it is called \"dinner.\" <br><br>DAY TWO: There are so many interesting variations of other Panamerican cuisine here in this village, I have had a tough time deciding what to eat. The menu contains such familiar things as tacos and burritos, but all with a Central American twist. Thankfully we have a local guide, Omar, who is genial (also somewhat funny and very informative) and willing to explain to us the complex local flavors. We have decided to sample the \"empanadas\" (of which they will serve in increment's of three, five, or seven - the last one perfect for sharing, though expensive at $12) to begin with and I have found them a range from delightful (cheese) to \"interesting\" (plantain - could have been sweeter).  There are many varieties of these local treasures ranging from sweets to meats.<br><br>DAY THREE: If I didn't know better, I would swear that the natives are in cahoots with Omar to fatten us up and put us on the menu (maybe that's just the b.y.o.b. talking). They are shoveling complementary chips and local salsa and pico de gallo like substances at us. There is nothing especially spicy but they will make these as mild or hot as you want. <br><br>DAY FOUR: I feel like I've been hit with a tranquilizer dart after trying to eat the main course. The potato taco is a herbivore's delight (flavorful and filling - which by this point is a given) - though they also specialize in many fish dishes and sandwiches. It comes with huge sides of rice, beans, and a cabbage salad. Some of the natives have \"messed up\" some of our orders but Omar has corrected these mistakes quickly and perfectly (and with minimal whipping of his villagemates). <br><br>DAY FIVE: We have begged our leave of Omar. He offers us another full sized meal called \"desert\" but I feel as though I may not be able to leave the village if I consume this. Perhaps I will come back again or have them deliver. They will send a food-bearing vessel to pretty much anywhere on the north side of Chicago - including downtown. <br><br>--- <br><br>Legend has it that on that final rain soaked night, the crew of the S.S. Veggie Supper Club left the port of Irazu and was never seen again due to being \"drunk\" on happiness, food, and conversation. Or there may have been a mutiny (though after Irazu it definitely wasn't due to cannibalism, that's for sure).

Irazu inspires mixed emotions within me. On the one hand, the food is relatively inexpensive and tasty. On the other hand, the service leaves much to be desired. I really wanted to give this restaurant four stars, but the simple truth is that the service could easily be remedied, yet it hasn't.<br><br>The good: All of the sandwiches I've had are fresh, delicious, and cheap. I'm talking $4.50, and while they aren't monstrous, nor are they dinky. The shakes are awesome, the burritos are huge and yummy (the veggie is especially good), and the freshly fried tortilla chips are just that--freshly fried. And, of course, the plantains. Mmm...plantains. <br><br>The bad: Ugh! I can't recall a time when I've been in and out of this place in under an hour. First of all, it's not terribly spacious, which isn't necessarily a big deal, until you realize they aren't using all available space. Yo, dig this mutha fuggin example: I just ate at Irazu this past Friday. It was very pleasant outside, and as usual, many people were waiting for tables. The patio was locked with a sign that read, \"We hope to have the patio opened by Memorial Day.\" Huh? The tables and chairs are already out. Why not open the patio now? Serve more people. Make more money. Easy.<br><br>The other issue with the service is that once you're seated, your server probably won't take your order for at least 15 minutes. After you've ordered your food, it'll likely be at least 30 minutes before it arrives. After you've eaten your food, it will likely be another 15 minutes before your server brings your check. The servers at Irazu certainly aren't unfriendly, but the problem is that I've only ever seen one server working at any given time, even when the lines are well out the door. This seems a bit ridiculous to me. Business is clearly doing well. Add a server to the Friday and Saturday night shifts.<br><br>The sum total: If you don't mind the wait, go to Irazu. If you're not fond of long waits, but still want some good food, just phone your order about a half an hour to 45 minutes before you'd like to pick it up. <br><br>Be in the know: Irazu does not deliver and they are cash only. Also, if they run out of potatoes or plantains, don't go all native and try the yuca. Just eat your sock, it would taste about the same.

Let it be known that I came to Irazu for a change of pace from typical Latin food, not because it was featured on the show. Chifrijo appetizer ($8.50) features delectably crispy fried pork, which blends well with spicy sauce, avocado, and the black bean and rice mixture that it comes with. Easily my highlight of the meal. Pepito sandwich ($5.95) is excellent for the price, although between the cheese, ribeye, beans, and brown Lizano sauce, it is a very rich sandwich. I'd recommend splitting it. Sadly, El Tico entree ($13.50) is a blander take on cuban ropa vieja; the beef is overcooked and too thick, as are the vegetables. This didn't have much going for it. Service is very good, and the closed off patio is very pleasant to dine on when it's nice outside. All in all, Irazu is a welcome departure from the usual Latin fare one finds in Chicago, but it's by no means superlative.

We chose the fried option, which was topped with garlic oil and deep-brown bits of roasted garlic. It tasted amazing at first, but proved a little too greasy for my taste.

This was served every morning when I visited Costa Rica, and it was hard to overcome that craving when I returned to the regular American pancake breakfast.

I chose the fried plantains, which were another oily-yet-extraordinary menu item--they could create a new genre of food with their collection of fried, heavy treats! A dining accomplice of mine chose the gallo pinto with scrambled eggs, which featured diced onions for a surprise twist of flavor.<br><br>We were served promptly by an adorably authentic old man who spoke minimal english and seemed a little aloof.

We ordered a bean/pork dip (or something like that) with chips for an appetizer. I usually don't like pork but let me tell you, this was phenomenal. I had to stop myself from ruining my appetite for my main meal. Next I ordered the garlic shrimp with vegetables. The shrimp, although small, were very tasty, the veggies were great, and the beans, rice and plantain sides were a perfect combination to complete the dish. Lots of food for not a lot of money.

Maybe because this is the epitome of the family-owned neighborhood gem.<br><br>Last January, I went to Costa Rica, and being the food enthusiast that I am, was a bit disappointed that CR is not exactly a culinary mecca. Everywhere we went, we ate the traditional Costa Rican meal: casado (some meat, beans, rice, egg, plantains, and a wimpy salad). So naturally, when my friend found out about the sole Costa Rican restaurant, we HAD to eat there during my visit, and I HAD to have the casado. My friend had the tilapia casado, which was perfect - light, lemony, and fresh tasting. I opted for the beef asado - AWESOME. You could tell the beef had been marinated in citrus and spice for a long time because the flavor was in your face and the meat super tender. Not to mention this was a HUGE portion, easily feeding two with everything on the plate. Our plantains were perfectly crisped, the traditional rice fluffy and well-seasoned. Another friend had the potato tacos, which came out totally unlike what we expected - more like rolled up taquitos than what tacos bring to mind. But she thought they were also good and very filling.<br><br>For old times' sake, my fellow travel companion and I got the guanabana shake with mango and papaya (respectively)...refreshing with plenty to share (or not!). On the whole, the meal was much better than some of the casados we had in CR!<br><br>My friend has been there several times and says that there is some inconsistency (like the tilapia was not so fresh, the plantains more soggy the last time she went), but on the whole that Irazu is pretty darn good. A great casual spot for two or a very small group...Bring a big appetite (or a friend to share with to save even more on the moderate prices)!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "So I read about Irazu months ago but never got over to the restaurant. About two months ago my friend and I went on a saturday night to grab dinner but they were super crowded and there were 3 groups of people waiting to be seated so we decided against it that night. So today after getting rid of some recycling on the way back I thought of Irazu! So stopped in with my friend and we both got the Vegetarian Burrito, I got mine with Spinach instead of lettuce also with sauteed Mushrooms. She got the same but without sourcream. We shared the chips brought to the table as well as one Empanada. All of the food was great. We both only ate half of our burritos because they were so filling.

I've had almost everything on the menu and have never been dissappointed. I have even tried some of their weekend specials that they have from time to time. Their shakes are the best, especially on a hot day. I recommend a 2 flavor of either oatmeal mango or oatmeal banana or even just simply oatmeal. <br><br>Now for food, For starters, I recommend their guac with freshly minced jalepenos on the side; Simple, fresh, and always delicious. <br>Now on to the main deal, Everyone says they have some of the best vegetarian selections around and I completely agree. I'm not a vegetarian, but I am a foodie. And when I'm in the mood, i will go meatless. Veggie Burrito with mushrooms and avocado or the veggie sandwich are my picks.They are jam packed with fresh veggies and are very well balanced and satisfying. As far as the meat selections, everything is good and I would base it on how hungry you happen to be when you visit. The Steak sandwich is by far my favorite and it was recommended to me by \"Mom\" who is one of the owners. Now if you are really hungry, I would order the Bistec Tico or the Casado dinner. Both come with a delicious portion of thin rib eye steak cooked in the very famous Lizano sauce (they're available by the bottle there if you want to take some home) The sauce is boss and has a tangyness with a little bit of a kick. You also get a fresh array of sauteed veggies and of course some rice and beans and a side of fried plantains with the dinners. I only get the Casado if I feel like having a fried egg with my meal....mmhmmmmm.<br><br>The servers are friendly and courteous and they make you feel right at home.

This is a huge portion and should be shared with another person unless you are a big eater. The steak was flavorful and rice was amazing.

Honestly, I have surprisingly not found too many places where that is true!  And the potato tacos were really good- I thought it was a bizarre thing to see and had to try them.  I know others have commented that they are a bit boring, and perhaps that's true, but I look at is as \"potatos- good. taco shell- good guacomole- good. rice- good\" it was all just plain good, even if not a terribly exciting dish (and it was plenty of food for the price too).  Based on this one attempt, I would love to have a reason to come back and try more of the menu.  I have no idea what my lunch partner ordered as all I remember is being irritated with him for being so ridiculously unimpressed (but that is a whole different story)<br><br>The outdoor seating area was nothing all that exciting- but I went in April on one of the very early nice days of the year, so I am guessing it gets spruced up a bit as the summer approaches.  Maybe my limited experience with this place is screwing with me- is there more seating somewhere else? This was a little patio with about 10 smallish tables right?  I think I'd like to try it at night some time, as I was there on a Saturday afternoon and there wasn't much atmosphere to speak of.  But I also appreciate outdoor seating in any form so I wouldn't hold it against them if I returned and had the same experience.<br><br>I would direct people here without hesitation, particularly if they were looking for something in that neighborhood.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I am a big fan of their empanadas and blck bean soup!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I like this place.

She'd spent part of last summer in Panama, and since there's seemingly no Panamanian restaurant in the city, this was the closest we could get. We approached the restaurant at 8:30 on a Tuesday and were dismayed to see patrons waiting all over the place in front of the restaurant. Fearing a ridiculous wait, we went to put our names into the line as soon as possible and found that it was just the line for patio tables. Seeing as it was still 90 degrees and humid, we selected an inside table and were seated immediately. Our waitress came promptly and quickly took our drink orders and got us the guacamole (again with the guac, I know...it's not costa rican but it was good) we asked for in a minute or two. We decided on getting some empanadas and then we both settled on some steaks (she got cubed tri-tip and I got a skirt steak. The empanadas arrived hot and fresh and although I was not a huge fan of the plantain one (just don't like plantains I guess), the chicken and beef and potato ones were delicious. The steaks came soon after we finished the empanadas and they were great. I ordered mine with the special Costa Rican rice and I was not disappointed.
