Not helpful in the slightest bit, even feeling like they are going above and beyond to sway you from drinking.<br><br>-The place is a screaming-tourist trap. It's entirely too small for the amount of people they let in. Just because you throw some palm trees up and bamboo, does not make you a tiki bar. I'm not a doctor in tiki bar setups but jeez this place goes only so far to be creative.<br><br>-The drinks while made well, are not traditional. I asked the waiter to make me a classic tiki drink and he snarled that he doesn't make drinks that way. Cool. Thanks man. It must be so hard to literally do one more thing but i guess when you're so busy, you can't. <br><br>-Seating is a joke. Multiple times we tried to stand close to the bar where there was space to stand, a bouncer came and told us that we couldnt stand there - there were no signs to indicate we couldn't. So we moved. A table opened up so we sat down only to be told we couldn't sit there, it was only for reservations. Again, no signs to indicate this, just being berated for trying to enjoy the super overpriced drink. Then, we couldn't too close to the tables by the bar for some unknown reason.

She told us they've never had a happy hour special and asked me to show her what I found online. I showed her and she brought her manager over and he said those aren't official happy hours by their company, it's just posts by random people that think they have happy hour. I thanked him for clarifying that and a few minutes later he ended up coming back with two zombie shots for us and told us \"here, we believe that every hour is happy hour\" and offered us complimentary shots. That was unexpected and sweet of him to do! The zombie shot was delicious! It was super sweet but also strong enough to give you a little buzz. <br>I ordered the top many chiefs drink because it had strawberries in it and I was craving some strawberries haha. The drink was tasty. You would think that it's light but after finishing it in 20 mins, I felt tipsy. My husband had then cobra's fang. On the menu, it indicated that his drink was on the stronger side and it sure was! It takes a lot for my husband to get drunk and he felt a buzz after just one drink.

Perhaps the name, Three Dots and a Dash is a morse code reference, a nod to being \"top secret\" in location. When you enter, you descend down a dark stair case with a wall adorned completely in skulls. The bar is dim lit with big round booths and the decor is very much tiki/beach themed with tiki lights, bamboo, tropical plants, palm grass, nautical rope, and ukuleles and tiki masks on the wall. The servers are all dressed in floral print dresses and Hawaiian shirts. The atmosphere is super fun/cool, fun theme, dark lit, moody and upscale vibe. Fun place for a birthday or group outing. The music started off very much Beach Blanket Bingo (60s beach movie), and then was music from Tarantino's Pulp Fiction (still kinda beachy, think Big Kahuna) but then veered away from beachy to Outkast's Miss Jackson, and Chance the Rapper. Still fun, but the dj couldn't make up his mind what genre he was in. <br><br>We made a reservation on Open Table for two and we arrived a little bit early but the hostess was able to seat us immediately.

Later on when our friends showed up, one was standing for a second before he sat down, and a server rushed over to ask if we had a reservation, and that she would have to ask her manager, even though we had a reservation and we'd been sitting there for over an hour, enjoying drinks. So that was sort of strange/off-putting. Despite this, the drinks were very tasty and have fun/festive presentation. They offer several fun themed tiki drinks, about $14-$16. The potency of alcohol level is marked by skulls. No skulls probably isn't too boozy, while one skull is moderately boozy, and two skulls would be denoted as deadly. All of the drinks have fun names like Aloha Felecia and My Anaconda Don't Want None served in coconuts and Tiki God mugs. They also offer group drinks that serve four to five that cost $65. One group drink on the menu, Rock Out with your Conch Out was $125 so it can get pricey. The group drinks are extremely festive and have awesome presentation though, so you get some bang for your buck.

I had the Strip and Go Naked, which the server had recommended and said was fruitier and had flavors of passionfruit, tangerine, and gin. It was served in a large tiki god mug with a tropical flower, and seahorse pick souvenir that has the bar's name on it. It was pretty tasty. My friend ordered the mai tai, which was very good and was probably the best tasting cocktail of the ones I tried, although a little less festive presentation. I also had the Jet Pilot, which had rum, lime, grapefruit, cinnamon, and absinthe and it was also very good. Another friend ordered the Anaconda Don't Want None and it was also good and had nice presentation. All of the cocktails on the menu have a picture next to them so you can see what kind of mug that they are served in. They also had a page on their menu of classic cocktails such as caipirinha and Cuba libre, which were a little bit less expensive. They also serve food like pu pu platters and burgers and shrimp. Service was a bit slow but it was busy.

They'll talk to you about their process, their style, and share their thoughts on the different notes of the drinks in a manner that is unpretentious and welcoming to even the most boring \"uh-I'll-have-a-rum-and-coke\" type (me, usually).<br><br>This staff, this bar - they're on to something special.

I think they will ID everyone (I mean, I walked in right after 4 giggling, suspiciously jubilant girls who surely made me look like I was their mom or something) so bring it. Then... then you enter the dark lair and prepare to worship at the alter of the tiki gods. I like. I like mucho. <br><br>The room is just as you would want it to be in a tiki bar. Cavernous. Dark. Tropical. I'm going to go ahead and say it: Chicago's Enchanted Tiki Room beckons (I know, I know. When your introduction to all things Tiki is formed by Walt Disney, you just can't help it).<br><br>Both times I've been here, I've very much enjoyed the atmosphere and Tiki libations, expertly crafted (although one of my friends found a squeeable bottle top in their drink) and garnished (those mermaid drink stirrers!!). Both times, though, I have to admit, service was a bit lax and not very friendly (for example, when we pointed out the bottle top in the drink, our server barely seemed to care and just took it away and brought another drink with a toneless, \"sorry about that.\") I can get past all of this, though because I do love this place otherwise.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I don't know why people are so over the moon about this place.

For that reason my experience has always been just fine - no line out the door, no wait for a table, drinks arriving right away. <br><br>As for the ambiance, it feels very Disneyland to me. They have the theme down pat with cute tiki related details everywhere and dim, moody lighting, but it definitely feels somewhat manufactured. But again, I'm a sucker for tiki so I was pretty into it. <br><br>As for their drinks, they go from classic to more creative versions of tiki cocktails. One of my faves is the Aloha Felicia, and not just because of the amazing name or the pineapple/skull cup it comes in (which I believe is available for purchase at a very high price!) If you're there with a group, why not splurge for a shareable drink like the Zombie or the Treasure Chest and make it a party! <br><br>As for the food, I've had nibbles and honestly I'd rather go elsewhere in this area for a meal.

We ordered the Lapu Lapu and it tasted as great as it looked! Very tropical.. I think many of us assume tropical drinks to be saccharine but Three Dots And a Dash does a great job balancing that and reinterpreting it with exotic flavors featuring unexpected ingredients. For example, falernum is commonly featured in the menu, and it's typically composed of almond, ginger, lime, vanilla, cloves, etc which truly grounds an otherwise \"fruity\" drink. We also ordered the namesake Three Dots and A Dash, and the Cobra's Fang. Both drinks were phenomenal but with the Cobra's Fang, you could not taste the absinthe at all! It was remarkable how they disguised an otherwise bitter undertone! The food was also great - initially started with the spring rolls and tuna poke before tacking on the Thai chicken wings and crab rangoon. The spring rolls were lightly skinned and actually had vermicelli in it! The tuna poke was just delightful, fresh, and light.

Love it. Can't wait to try the rest of their drinks.<br><br>They also have these crazy group drinks that can serve up to 8 people. (That treasure chest drink is almost $400...!!!

I've been an avid follower of these guys on Instagram and after years of obsessing, decided to make the trip from Atlanta to check it out! Let me just tell you folks, Three Dots and a Dash did NOT disappoint! Every dreamy drink I put to my lips was better than the last, the poke- pretty perfect and the heartfelt service by bartender Chris... intuitive and impeccable! We went fairly early on a rainy Monday, had no wait and found two seats at a very occupied by bar which we heard was rare! The ambiance sweeps you away to a 70's-esque South Seas escape with bamboo accents, up-lit tiki masks and pops of Polynesian kitsch around every corner. I see people commenting on drink prices but these are authentic tiki drinks, hand-crafted with premium ingredients and I actually thought they were UNDER priced for what they were. They are not just drinks- they are experiences! From the custom tiki mugs they are crafted in, to interactive elements such as fire and dry ice, to the gobs of garnish and swizzle sticks each drink is topped with, $14 bucks is a steal! If you are a Rum head, this is your spot! Literally, hundreds of beautiful rums to choose from! We also can't say enough about custom cocktail crafter, Chris! Watching him create cocktails, interact with his guests and gleefully taking our picture requests for Instagram for about a thousand times was a joy! He appreciated how much we were enjoying our experience and as a former service industry professional, that truly touched me! Please pass my compliments on!

Like I said, though, both were awesome and it was hard to choose when every other drink looked just as sinfully good.<br><br>I'm obsessed with the mugs/glasses the drinks came in, and had I been drunk enough I probably would have splurged and bought one.  Yes, you can buy the mugs that the drinks come in, but for about $30.  They're super awesome, though!  Speaking of awesome, can we just talk about the actual atmosphere itself?  The lighting is very dimmed which sets the mood for a relaxing get together with friends; there's a bunch of lounges amongst the regular tables and the tiki bar itself dazzles with brilliance as it displays all of it's rum.  It's fairly big inside, but from what I hear this doesn't suffice most of the time due to hw buy it gets.  When I went on a weeknight it wasn't overly crowded and we got a table right away.  Obviously, the weeknights allow for easier access than do the weekends, but isn't that the case anywhere?  <br><br>Okay, so we have established that drinks are the bomb and the atmosphere is legit - well what about the food?  I didn't eat much, and there's really not much to choose from (because it's primarily a lounge, duhhh), but we got the Thai fried chicken.  This was spectacular and I would highly recommend that you get it if and when you make your way to Three Dot and a Dash.  <br><br>P.s. to actually get into Three Dots and a Dash you have to find the alleyway.  Here are some clues for finding it: there's a blue light that illuminates the entry way, there's a big old bouncer standing outside and there are most likely people wandering around the same alleyway, aimlessly looking around.  You have to be 21 to get in, so if you're not then I guess you're S.O.L.  Once you're in, though, you are golden and you're about to get tipsy!  (\"Everybody in the club get tipsy!\")<br><br>Although all the drinks have multiple components to them, the bartender(s) are efficient in making them, but the serving staff does a good job of making sure all the patrons are getting what they need and in a timely fashion.  Overall, this is a great establishment and I'm excited to come back for more drinks.  Aloha for now!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DwkA9zijhvQgGIx2dY4jNA/348s.jpg", "caption": "Thai Fried Chicken"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/n1ZJXley7Wo77UgaBIGQkQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Dead Reckoning drink"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/l3QXoHRTR_PP7hKz46-1UA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Jet Pilot drink"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "One of the coolest bars I've ever been to!

My most recent visit this spring on a Monday night at 10:30pm with a party of 4 was disappointing. There were at least 6 large tables that were empty with \"reserved\" signs. I asked a waitress if we could sit down, and she directed me to the hostess stand. The hostess told me it would be a 30 - 45 minute wait for a table. I walked back inside to tell my guests, one of which had already grabbed a menu and was settling in at a smaller table. I barely got back to the group to explain that we weren't allowed to sit anywhere when the hostess rushed to the table and sternly told us the table was reserved. My friend questioned whether all of the tables were actually reserved, and the hostess said they were. My group walked back to the bar area, where all of the seats were taken. We didn't feel welcome. We started putting on our coats to leave, and the waitress who originally told us to talk to the hostess came back and told us we could sit at one of her empty tables (which was 'reserved'). After we were seated, the service and drinks were great. However, the venue needs to think carefully about how they are treating their customers.

And then the bar itself has a tongue-in-cheek, retro, sophisticated tiki bar! <br><br>Their drinks are BEAUTIFUL! Jet pilot and their daiquiri are some of their best! They have elaborate, kitschy garnishes...some with lovely flowers and elaborate \"straw art\". My second trip I tried the crash landing, which was good, and strong....it seemed to have a bit too much of an anise and nut meg flavor to it, which left a pretty yucky after taste. <br><br>The drinks are definitely pricey, but the motif of the restaurant, strength and appearance of their drinks makes up for it!

Love the tiki! Drinks are all tiki related... Lots of rum. I was visiting from San Diego and decided to try this spot out-someone recommended a reservation because it's packed on a Sat & they claimed they waited 2 hours previously. Tried getting a reservation without success but decided to see if we could get in. The wait (in an alley with tiki torches) was about 15 min- not bad. The wait for drinks (with the first couple of our group) took 20 min, a piece, at least. We had a group of 8, the waitresses were extremely rude about where we were standing, yet there was only so much room to stand in line and we weren't trying to cut or stop people who were waiting from getting drinks. I quickly got tired of being stuck in line after almost an hour of holding a drink I didn't feel right drinking since a few of my group didn't have drinks yet. I also noticed quite a few open tables so I walked out to talk to the hostess who was sooo cool and tried to find a spot to have us seated- successfully! Friends were happy & impressed but our waitress wasn't interested in waiting for us to finish with our first round, nor was she interested in bringing us menus for us to order another round, so 3 of our 8 decided to leave. Buzz kill! I asked another waitress for menus and we eventually ordered fishbowls. Too bad half the group already left. I requested light ice in my fishbowl (hot/cold tooth sensitivity) from our disinterested waitress- didn't get it. We quickly left. It was my birthday and I was visiting from San Diego- this place was not worth the hype (check grass skirt, false idol, & Bali hi in SD for decent tiki bars).

Plus, it gets automatically docked for being in a basement.  (Please see, \"Inglourious Basterds\" regarding basements.)<br><br>Let's start positively: amazing drinks!  I mean, you need about three (3) total, and I have an insane tolerance.  Drinks tend to be on the tropical and sweeter side.  Personally, I recommend the \"Pain Killer\" with subtly tangy but thicker viscosity and several types of rum & 'Island-style' liquors/liqueurs.  It is a tasty compliment that is higher on the sweetness scale but not overly sugary.  Obviously and if it's a group effort, go for the Volcano or other monster drinks for the experience.  (Again, it's definitely a taxi/ride-share night.)<br><br>The execution requires, though, that you have a state of awareness.  Breaking that down, the theme of Island/Hawaiian/Tahitian/Caribbean means that you're getting amazing, hand-crafted drinks; so SOME WAIT is to be expected.  HOWEVER, I make a stern recommendation to get a table--either reservation or on the spot.  (I have experienced that their rules have changed a few times as to whether you can have a reservation back-and-forth, so call ahead to see what they're doing that day.)  Additionally and as of my last visit (see, I don't hate it b/c I keep returning), they had removed a terrible manager that was basically a Persian Frat Guy A-Hole, so already this place reacts and improves: excellent.  With that, the staff is putting out QUALITY--NOT QUANTITY.<br><br>As to the ambiance, this as started to improve.  Recently, this place HALTED the \"wall-to-wall\" people posture and the 5-deep bar wait.  However, it can get full.  Thus and again: Get at table!<br><br>I have to say that \"it is worth the wait\" applies if you approach this place with your eyes opened.  But for a tag line, let's go with \"Best Hawaiian/Island drinks outside of the exotic locations in the world.\"", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The doctor is in.

Not that this place can handle all people getting out of their seat to dance; however, the music is so loud that it makes it hard to talk so a little mingling while standing at the bar would justify the music being so loud and consequentially tolerable. Music is so good and yet I find it interesting that no one dances. They just wiggle in their seat and that's it. So either the music should be lowered a bit or perhaps a little bit more space - especially space closer to the bar- should be made for people to just stand up and have a drink and perhaps wiggle while standing, as it is difficult to carry a conversation there.<br><br>With all that said - please just remember this the most: it's a must \"go to\" for at least that one time.

You either like it or you don't. Can't make anyone like anything. But those that LOVE it - LOVE it! I won't say those of you that don't like \"3 Dots\" don't \"get\" it because I HATE when I hear that. (Mostly from my wifey poo.) For instance after lame romantic comedy she'll say to me  \"You just didn't get it\". And I'll reply back \"Nope just didn't like it.\" For instance I enjoy ALIENS 4, Akira, Spirited Away, Japan over France for vacation, and truly believe The Moody Blues \"A Question of Balance\" is the greatest single recording from in history . Good luck convincing anybody else. I've tried and failed . We humans like what we like. <br><br>I'm freakie for tiki. You just don't like it. That's it! But I believe many of you may grow to dig \"3 Dots and a Dash.\" Someday. One day you may (sorry) \"get\" it. I used to be teased about  my love of the musical Hamilton, Shatner, West World, The Prisoner (TV show), Iron Man, Biale Black Chicken wine,and Star Trek. Now they are all retro hip and cool. I was ahead of the curve. However, sometimes I'm not ahead of the curve. Lost in Space (1965),Johnny Quest, Land of the Lost, Thundaar, Voltron, The Kinks (Arista years), Ultraman , Riverview Amusement Park collectibles, Johnny Socko, & Wizzo the Magician, I'm still almost alone on in my appreciation of.<br><br>\"3 Dots & a Das\" could turn out to be either for you . Epic or just Blah. Both crowds correct.<br><br>To me? EPIC! Big time!<br><br>I'm fascinated by tiki culture. It's my private obsession. I've always DREAMED of being in a Tiki Bar when it was happening, hip, and THE place to be. Don the Beachcomber, The Luau, Trader Vic's, Kahiki, or Kona Kai, in their heyday in the 1960's. Wow, to have been there once upon a puff when Tiki was THE scene. To me it'd be like being at the original Playboy Club in Chicago, The Pump Room w/ Irv Kupcinet and Sinatra drinking 2 fingers of Jack, or seeing The Doors on stage at The Whiskey a Go Go, back in the day. <br><br>My experiences of seeking tiki in every city during a lifetime have always lead me to the old, the faded, and the dingy. Their heyday but a mustard burp lost to the vapor. Their glory years in the rearview mirror.<br><br>So my visit to \"3 Dots and a Dash\" made me burst w/ joy and almost cry. Sincerely.<br><br>It's but a dream. An oasis in a basement. Beautiful women in Polynesian attire bring bizarre expertly crafted concoctions loaded w/ the freshest fruit and ingredients YOU CAN TASTE. (Their intricate drinks aren't from some stale powered mix or a can.) Exotica fills you from first sip.<br><br>Notice the thought that went into the menu . Kitsch overload! Just holding that menu was worth the visit. Did I just time travel? Nobody does menus like this anymore. Slapdash and rehash is the norm now. Not here. Delight is in the details. <br><br>Notice the different sculpted glasses for every drink!!! Each individual  one a work of art.<br><br>It has an almost \"secret\" speakeasy entrance The Batman would tip his cowl to.<br><br>The swizzle sticks are mermaids.<br><br>Is that a full cinnamon stick and large chunk of coconut in this icy ceramic totem? <br><br>Now my treasure is others trash. I get that! You may HATE this place. Some evidently do. I read your reviews. But I think they are  the born in Chicago types that sit at Blackhawks games and cheer on The Redwings. Jag offs. <br><br>Some will see silly glasses, tacky menus, dank basement, and sexism on display in some of the art and required staff garb. Ugh. I feel sorry for those that recoil in falsehood. Oh , the deluded brainwashed masses.The offended by everything crowd. A cancer to our society really.  <br><br>Sorry, I keep getting off topic because I'm still buzzed out of my zombied skull right now.<br><br>If I wanted to be like hipsters that breathe out loafs of loathing at all they survey I would complain that the music they play wasn't even a bit tiki. The music could be much better. They could throw a bit of exotica or space age bachelor pad music  in. Heck, even a minute of Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Bird music might be nice. Xylophone anyone?<br><br>The food I tried was great but the drinks are the real stars. <br><br>Drinks that could fuel a stealth bomber.<br><br>BEWARE LADIES you might wake-up w/ someone that looks like me next to you if you aren't careful. <br><br>Deceivingly POWERFUL in their almost unseen ability to sneak up on you their drinks are like an invisible maniac in his invisible Cadillac that run you over.

My gps was no help either. It literally is along a side street and in an alley, and then down the stairs. I arrived around 6pm on a Fri and it was PACKED! There was not one empty seat in the place and since it is first-come-first-served seating, it took a while for me to get a seat. It actually took about an hour for me to get a seat (and I was by myself). <br><br>The decor is interesting- cheesy tiki theme. However, it is not too cheesy, it's actually kinda cute. The bartenders are all decked out in the typical tropical garb equipped with the standard Hawaiian shirts. They were all very friendly and patient, especially considering most people in the place appeared to be tourists. My bartender wasn't even annoyed by me asking her to describe each of the drinks before I ordered and to order them by level of sweetness (this is a tiki bar after all). Luckily, the three drinks that I chose were not terribly sweet, as tiki drinks tend to be. Here are the drinks that I tried:<br><br>1. Painkiller No. 3 (called 109 now) - made with Virgin Island and Jamaican rums, coconut, passion fruit, pineapple and cream<br><br>2. Banana Daiquiri (most popular)- made with Jamaican spiced rum, coconut liqueur, banana,  lime and nutmeg, all blended together like a smoothie<br><br>3. Jet Pilot- Jamaican and Dominican rums, lime, cinnamon, grapefruit, Falernum, Absinthe and Angostura bitters<br><br>Drinks are $13 and punch bowls are $65 I believe. All drinks were very well made and none of them were too sweet. Every last one of them was also extremely boozy, even the banana daiquiri. After three of those boozy tiki drinks, I was drunk and needed to stumble back to the L. Definitely can't wait to go back.<br><br>Fun note: All of the drinks come in cool and unique tiki cups, in which you can purchase if they have extras for around $10. Also, each drink is is a masterpiece, adorned with flowers, shrubs and other cool things to make it fancy.

Except there is a line formed outside so you'll probably notice it. <br>Walking in this place has all the jazz of a tiki bar and the drinks are as good as how adorable they are! The presentation of all the drinks are on point. They only have two people working behind the bar and it's always super packed so service can be super slow. The drinks are also on the pricey side seeing as how they're suppose to be shared among friends but to be fair it's not that strong so you could probably just drink it yourself... <br>This place is great if you've never been or want to bring new friends to a place they haven't been before but I don't think I would be a regular. There's so many other bars especially in that area that are more attentive with serving patrons.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I love tiki bars and I really couldn't get enough of the speak easy style find. <br><br>I came with my sister and found a seat at the bar.  We shared a banana daiquiri and a larger bowl drink.

After wrapping up dinner at a different establishment around 8:45pm we asked our server for any recommendations for a night cap before heading back to our hotel. Considering we are from Miami, on a business trip and unfamiliar with the area we figured asking a local would be the best option. She pointed us over to three dots. Upon walking up to the establishment which had a back door entrance we noticed a reception booth/kiosk but no one was around. We waited for a couple minutes as we were under the impression the establishment was closed and began making other plans. A couple minutes later a rather large/heavier set gentleman with a beard in his mid 30's, about 5' 10\" and a hat came outside and IMMEDIATELY told us we could not come in because \"we were too drunk\". There was no prior engagement with this man, he walked outside without hesitation and without any exchange of words between our party and him immediately gave us that line. We initially thought he was joking considering there had been absolutely no interaction with him when stepped out side to greet us, unfortunately he was not joking. Also, 2 out of the 3 clients I was with DO NOT even drink alcohol. I asked to speak to the manager which he then told me was not in. This might have been true however on a busy Saturday night I can't believe there would not be any managment on the property. I was extremely disappointed, offended and disrespected as my clients and potential investors were with me and looking to have a good time. I hope management can look into this issue as it would be a shame if this happens to anyone else. I am a partner at 2 different restaurants/bars in Miami and this kind of behavior would be totally unacceptable In any of my locations and would not be taken lightly. This is not how you treat guests. As a business owner myself I would hate to see an establishment go down for issues like this which could be easily resolved with proper training and staffing.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Great drinks and strong.we went and it was crazy busy.

Even though we had reservations two months prior, we were jammed into a booth. We did even come close to fitting, so they ended up placing two chairs awkwardly on the outside of the booth. We were told this is how they always do it, but I find that hard to believe given how awkward it felt (and I don't understand why it wasn't already set up like that).

It was definitely strong and fairly tasty - until I tried my hubby's signature cocktail. And let me tell you, it's deemed that for a reason. The \"Three Dots and a Dash\" drink was fantastic.

Clark, but could not find the entrance.  We asked a nearby valet where the bar was.  He said the entrance is in the alley.  We walked around to the alley and sure enough there was a bouncer standing between two tiki torches.  We walked in and then proceeded down stairs, past a pretty cool wall of skulls.  (They were doing there best to get us into the mood).<br><br>Personally, I was on a mission to learn about the bar and its drinks.   And I would say I succeeded in increasing my curiosity for Rum.<br><br>Our bartender was Aiden and he was quite engaging.  He gave us the spiel on the 290 rums that the bar has.  I was surprised that there were that many kinds of rum.  But knowing the little history of rum in the americas (and the west indies), I should have known there would be a significant selection of rum at this tiki bar.  <br><br>I was not sure what to order and Aiden was quite helpful.  He made me a daiquiri (not on the menu) which if I had I been paying attention it, would have been added as a cocktail of the week recipe for my youtube channel (chezmacbistro).  <br><br>We had a couple of the appetizers:  the Tuna Poke and the Thai Fried Chicken.  Both were delicious and made the whole experience fantastic.<br><br>I watched as they prepared a slew of different drinks using traditional and modern presentations.  They even used liquid nitrogen to chill the glasses!<br><br>I will be returning to Three dots for more research on the rum list!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Probably one of the coolest bars I've been to!!!

Our experience here was nothing shy of embarrassing and discriminatory! We had a reservation for a party of 8 and learned earlier that evening that our friends also had reserved for a party of 4. Upon arrival, we checked in with the hostesses and asked if at all possible could we be seated near our friends. They stated that it may not be possible however approached us later with an opportunity to be seated together- both parties in one area. We were told there would be a required 20% gratuity, one bill with no more than 5 separate cards for payment and no minimum requirement. We were very appreciative and excited at this point. This quickly changed as we were shortly after approached by who we later learned was the shift manager, Geoffrey. Geoffrey came over and stated that we would be seated shortly however the hostesses left one stipulation out as a requirement for our party. He continued stating that because we were a party of 12, we would need to secure a $400 food and drink bill and would have a 2 hour maximum time frame. We explained that we were not a party of 12 and that we were told by the hostesses there would be no minimum required. Not that this would be an issue with a party of 12 successful working professionals. Geoffrey then expressed that he wanted to get us seated and \"would be wiling to meet us halfway at $200\". Please note that we never asked for any accommodations in reference to payments and would have been perfectly fine if our friends were not seated with us. We stated this multiple times. Nonetheless, we were then seated together and approached by a rude female server who literally snatched the menu out of one of our guests hands and proceeded to review the drink options. A male server then approached another guest and stated that he would need to move. At this point, we are certain he made a mistake however he returned with Geoffrey. This time Geoffrey is holding a laminated pamphlet and a bill from the previous seated guests in the area. He stated that he wanted us to see what the guests seated in the area prior to our arrival paid or secured in food and drinks- which he said was roughly $600. He went on to say that the policy of Three Dots and a Dash is that parties over 8 would require a deposit. We again explained that this was never our intention and we were only given the opportunity to be seated together per the hostesses. At this point, other restaurant guests were beginning to turn around and watch as Geoffrey continues to explain why he was now requesting a group of now 12 people squeeze into a booth and two chairs that would barely seat the original 8. The behavior exhibited by this manager was completely unprofessional, abrasive and discriminating. The assumption was made that we would not spent what he felt was appropriate from the moment he approached our group. Additionally, there was never any attempt to recognize that we were only operating on what we were told by his team. As a leader, he made no attempt to ensure customer service was priority and address miscommunication regarding the situation with his team. Instead, he stood in the middle of the establishment and in many ways attempted to berate guests who were looking forward to an evening of celebration.  For purposes of time, I will not recall verbatim everything he stated however at one point he nade reference to his skin color in comparison to ours. As if this was relevant, perhaps to him it was. We were embarrassed and disappointed to say the least. The hostesses were very apologetic for our encounter and we were thankful however I will not be visiting this establishment again.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This is a nice tiki bar place.

Yes, we were those tourists everyone seems to mention on here. Finding the bar was not as difficult as I had expected.  Just look for the blue lights in the alley and you're good to go. The atmosphere was great and did not seem over the top like some bars can be when they have a theme. Despite the room filling up with people, we were greeted and served promptly by the bartender. I ordered the strip and go naked and the SO ordered the rum barrel. My drink was served in a cute tiki glass with a mermaid swizzle stick, orchid, and pineapple leaves as garnish. The presentation was really a treat. The drinks were balanced and not too sweet. Mine was fresh and fruity, though for the price tag, I'm on the fence whether it was worth it. The ingredients were clearly fresh and the bartender knew exactly what he was doing, and the bar is downtown, so I suppose it's just the typical price of admission. The rum barrel was strong, which was designated by the single skull next to it on the menu. By the way, the menu does a great job of describing each drink along with the ingredients. The rum barrel was definitely worthy of at least one of those deadly little skulls, so I shudder to think what a double skull tastes like. This place was on my bucket list, so I can happily say I can cross it off. Would I come back?  I would consider it, but the size of the crowd and lack of seats is a huge turn off (yes, I realize reservations can be made, but the place just gets packed and more than a little claustrophobic).

Three Dots and a Dash security and management made several visits to the table asking the guests (not my sister and her friend) if they were ok. My sister was confused to what the issue was and soon everyone felt uncomfortable. No Three Dots and a Dash employee or management member came over to discuss any questions or concerns. <br>I say all the above as a factual statement to leave out any prejudice and bias- Now this is where it leans to that. My sister, myself and the guests are all African-American.

She was embarrassed that the staff made an obvious yet passive attempt to point her and her guests out for sitting with other patrons.

Our server was so friendly and on top of her game, it's been quite a while since I've had such fabulous service on all levels.<br><br>I tried a few different cocktails with my favorite being Bunny's Banana Daiquiri which was kind of like an alcoholic banana slushie. I think it was my favorite because of the adorable garnishes - fruit animals for the win! Everyone raves about Painkiller No. 3 and I have to agree flavorwise, it was a real winner. After trying the signature Three Dots & a Dash drink and the Jet Pilot in addition to the two previously mentioned, I feel like you really can't go wrong no matter what you order. Each drink is well executed, tastes delicious and comes out looking like a mini masterpiece.<br><br>Be sure to make a reservation because the wait outside can get up to 2 hours on busy nights. I'm sure I'll come back to Three Dots and a Dash as I simply fell in love with the upscale tiki joint.<br><br>My favorite part of Three Dots and a Dash - the bad@$$ skull wall on your way downstairs to the joint.

They were really strong, pricey, and took forever! It was well worth it though. Watching the bartenders make these well crafted concoctions was part of the fun!  Look up on the way out, you will see a wall of skulls. Creepy and cool!

The entrance is a little hard to find since the entrance was through the alley and not off the main street. We got there around 8:30 and there was already a small line outside. When we got in, the place was pretty packed since it was a Friday night. The main focus of the room was the actual tiki bar. There were a few stools at the bar and tables along the walls. Overall, this place had a chilled out vibe with dark lighting and buzzing energy from the crowd. I would definitely recommend trying to get a table if you have at least a small group of people.<br><br>Drinks: Damn, these drinks were STRONG. As a fan of making stiff drinks myself, I like their style. These guys don't mess around. One or two drinks could definitely get you going. Yea, the drinks are $13 each, but it's not your typical jack and coke style order. Each drink has a bunch of different components and you can actually see the amount of work the bartenders put into every drink. Expect to wait a little bit if the bar is swamped. All the drinks come in different style tiki cups and have different fruit and decorative garnishments. I think I even saw one drink that made a banana look like a dolphin haha. <br><br>Jet Pilot - Three different kinds of rum. Get it if you like stiff drinks.<br><br>Dr. Funkhouser - A little bit sweeter than the Jet pilot, but still good and equally as potent.<br><br>We were lucky enough to get a table so we also decided try 3 of their punch bowls: <br>Zombie Punch<br>Pieces of Eight<br>Scorpion Bowl<br><br>I'm not gonna lie, things were a little hazy at this point in the night so I don't really remember the different flavors of each. All I know is they all tasted good, had a ton of liquor in it, and was a fun way to drink with your friends.<br><br>Food: The food was pretty tasty, but pricey for the amount that you get. <br><br>Luau Chips - These were light and airy and paired well with the bunch of dipping sauces they gave us. It's definitely on the small side and we could've used more to soak up all that liquor haha.<br>Curry Chicken Skewers -  Asian style marinated chicken. I didn't really taste too much of the curry flavor.<br>Pork Belly Buns - Standard pork belly, tender and flavorful.<br><br>Overall, 3 dots is a cool, fun place to start off the night with really strong drinks.

Although we did not have a reservation, they were extremely accommodating and were able to get a table until 6:30pm. Our waitress did a great job of walking newcomers throughout the menu and giving recommendations. She was attentive throughout the evening and was patient throughout the process of dividing the check. Our group started with individual drinks. I had the Jet Pilot which was awesome. I really enjoyed the cinnamon and absinthe components of the cocktail. My favorite part about the drinks at Three Dots is that while they are sweet and tiki themed, they always taste natural and fresh and are consistent. They also are great for sipping and last a long time (if you want them to). Next, our group decided on ordering the infamous treasure chest. At $385 it's an excellent way of celebrating. It comes out bubbling and overflowing with dry ice fog and a glowing bottle of Dom Perignon. Once placed on the table, it is opened to reveal a trough containing the drink and the Dom is opened and poured in. Our group drank it with excitement and it was definitely the highlight of our time there. After that, a few others and I split another large format drink called The Zombie. This was excellent as well and served as a great close to an extremely enjoyable happy hour.<br><br>Overall, I love this place because it truly is a great bar.

I'm old and not very hip anymore, so I made a res on Open Table so I would be guaranteed a table and an enjoyable experience!<br><br>We arrived at 7:30 on a Saturday night and I definitely got lost trying to find the cool, secret alleyway entrance.

We were seated right away at a half-circle booth along the wall of the bar and dug into the menu to decide on drinks.<br><br>I began with the Jet Pilot, which I chose because it had grapefruit and lime. Admittedly, I didn't love it. The cinnamon was super powerful in it and the drink was exceptionally boozy. But the presentation was deeeeelightful and I was intrigued enough to try more. My next drink was the \"Cacchen Some Rays,\" which I chose because it had cold brew coffee in it, even though the rest of my party thought I was crazy to order a drink filled with coffee, tequila, rum, passion fruit, lime, and pineapple, it was strangely delicious! All of those seemingly clashing flavors melded together into a sweet, caramelly, complex drink. My final beverage was the Demarara Dry Float, a sweet, floral concoction that was easily the most drinkable of my choices and I would definitely order again. Some of my favorites from around the table were the Saturn, which tasted like an amped up Tom Collins, and the banana daiquiri, which was sweet and decadent.<br><br>Though the drinks were fun, the food was AMAZING. Having perused the menu prior to arriving, I knew that they offered mostly small plate type snacks and the food was not the main focus of our visit, but it was incredible! We began with luau chips and guac. The chips are thick, almost chewy, fried bits of guacamole-holding deliciousness. We also got the Thai fried chicken, a sweet and spicy bowl of chicken morsels doused in addicting sauce, the tuna crisp which was a refreshing bowl of fresh tuna pieces tossed with an avocado cream and served with chips, and the pork belly buns which, albeit small, were incredibly delicious, perfectly decadent, wonderfully flavored, and addicting.

I love the decor here and that it's underground as well, it gives it a very cool feeling-a cross between a club and a beach bar that you'd find in the Caribbean. The tables are decorated with fishbowl centerpieces with miniature \"beach scopes\" in them, so cute. <br><br>Our server was fantastic with recommendations and was efficient and kind. I would recommend any of the drinks, but I love the traditional Pua Pua Punch, it's simple, fruity, and just what you'd picture drinking at the beach.

Our server was great with refilling our waters and even suggested that \"water is your best friend after two of those drinks\"! Although I didn't like the actual drink, I loved the dolphin banana garnish on the banana Daiquiri. I believe there is a photo of me kissing said dolphin floating around of instagram and Yelp...<br><br>The food here is great too, surprising so as the drinks are more touted than anything else. I loved the pineapple guacamole with luau chips and the pork buns were second to Sunda's.

I would recommend this place for a date, group outing, birthday celebrations, and honestly anything else. If you want a table, make sure and make a reservation as all of the tables are already reserved and the bar becomes standing room only very quickly.

The platter came with meatballs, egg rolls, crispy chicken bites, pork skewers and yucca fries; all with some sort of Asian sauce or seasoning.

Premium Tiki bar feel, completely with cool blue/green lighting, vestiges of bamboo and tropical garb, and of course a wall of 100+ types of rum.  <br><br>The big thing here is the group drinks, and looking at the menu everything cocktail seems uniquely crafted with it's own special features. For example, there was the Zombie Punch which comes in a skull cup and is lit on fire, or what we ordered being the Pieces of 8 which came with in a giant oyster(?) mold with straws for all 7 of us. Rum, Passion Fruit, Lemon, it was pretty tasty but the drinks they make here are otherwise pretty strong. Granted these aren't cheap($13 a cocktail, the grouop drinks are usually a little less per person), but a great scene to visit and certainly try out.<br><br>Also, our server was THE nicest server I have ever had at a bar.

I ordered the Pago Pago cocktail which had rum, pineapple, and cacao and my friend ordered the Dead Reckoning which had Jamaican rum and pineapple. I was upset because the woman next to me ordered the Pago Pago as well and she had a piece of pineapple in her cocktail but I didn't... how inconsistent. I guess the guy was trying to hurry up and finish my drink because not too long after, it was change of shift and he clocked out. Both drinks were disgusting and too overpowering. I just wanted to enjoy my cocktail which I thought would've been sweet (especially with the rum and pineapple) but I was struggling to finish and savor my drink. Is $13 expensive for a cocktail? No, it's a standard price considering it's Chicago. However, was it worth $13? Nope!

Quite often, another server kept coming over trying to take away our cocktails which weren't finished yet. I get that the glasses/mugs aren't transparent and so you can't see if the person has finished yet or not, but damn let me savor my 13 buck drink. It appeared also that some peeps tried stealing the cups (said something on the menu about the cups are not meant to be stolen - duh lol- and that you can purchase them at the shop if you want to take them home), so I guess maybe that explains why they were so eager to take away our drinks? I could see that being an issue on crowded weekends, or people drinking fast on weekends, but come on, it was a Monday night, and I'm not going to finish my drink in 20 minutes lol. <br>The waitress also kind of was putting pressure on us to order more each time she passed by, and I just wasn't feeling that.

I despise rum. And I hate sickly sweet (or even moderately sweet) cocktails. But even I can't deny that Three Dots & a Dash is an nifty little spot that has filled a niche here in Chicago. No one hangs out at a tiki bar every day/weekend (nor should they), but as a novelty, and a place to take others (maybe out-of-towners), it works well. <br><br>As tiki bars should be, it's dark (basement), though I could totally use some more kitsch. The glasses are different for every drink, and I'm not going to lie - could totally be worth it to choose a drink just based on the mug it comes in. Presentation is spectacular (especially the flaming bowls). <br><br>And even me, rum hater, can find a good cocktail (specifically, Pinky Gonzales). Golden Glove is one of the \"less sweet\" options, or Ports of Call. <br><br>Expect a line on weekends. When busy, best to try and grab a spot at the bar to have a captive bartender. People may complain about service, but tiki bar bartenders have to have one of the hardest jobs out there (EVERY drink is a piece of work). So keep that in mind.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "It was almost S.O.S. when we arrived at Three Dots and a Dash without a reservation, because despite the early (for Chicago nightlife) hour there was already a line. Since the weather is getting cold, be sure to plan ahead! (Really: the smelly, guttering tiki torches that rim the alley need to be replaced with heating torchieres.)<br><br>Speaking of the alley, despite the fact that they are seemingly trying to cultivate a quasi-speakeasy vibe, you can still find it pretty readily. If you're walking on Clark, look in the alley between Hubbard and Illinois (conveniently lit with blue neon); you will see a small sign hanging from the building (pass the service door for Bub City, oh yeah and look for those tiki torches). If there is a wait, don't buy it if they tell you ten minutes; it was closer to twenty.<br><br>Once enough people came out to let us in, we made the odyssey down the skull-lined passage into the cavernous depths of the lobby where we were met by...a Polynesian sage? A harem of hula girls? No, the hostess in a Hawaiian print maxi dress and huge hipster glasses, who told us there was standing room at the bar or we could wait for a table. The wait wasn't bad and we were soon ensconced in a clubby little booth along the bamboo-lined wall. <br><br>The cocktail menu is huge, and unless you are an advanced mixologist you won't be able to guess what any of these drinks will taste like, since there are so many ingredients in each and the average person probably isn't familiar with falernum, orgeat and fernet. Might as well pick the one with the most fun mug and go from there. <br><br>I chose the eponymous Three Dots and a Dash, which was rather spicy (probably due to its ingredients of allspice and falernum). Interesting, but I would try something else next time. My friend went with the Golden Glove, in a slender, gilded bamboo-shaped glass, and despite it not being a very large glass, and not one of the drinks indicated to be particularly strong (which are marked with a skull on the menu), she was quickly on her ass. We offset the booze with food: crab rangoon, coconut shrimp, and Thai fried chicken; all good, particularly the last.<br><br>Ambiance is fabulous: the lighting, the music, the sand terrarium centerpieces on your table. The place is run by Lettuce Entertain You and those folks know how to put a restaurant together. I'm too young to have crossed paths with the original Trader Vic's, and the fabled Chin Tiki of Detroit (RIP) closed just after I was born. But I don't know who wouldn't love this! Loosen up and enjoy.<br><br>After one drink, though, we were ready to bail. My friend had been overcome by her cocktail, and a table of four squealing twentysomething girls arrived beside us, quickly sucking down the Scorpion Bowl group cocktail they'd ordered. Once we finally flagged the bustling waitress, we made the malevolently lurking table-counting guy happy [this being the dude who relays via earpiece to the doorman when there will be space for new customers] and headed out.<br><br>Overall, it was fun to spend an hour or two in the islands and shake off the chill of the Chicago night!

Needless to say I hung out in joint since I was a kid, i worked in the bar, I asked my wife to marry me on stage and we had my mom's funeral service there too. So I am very qualified to talk about the tiki culture and the cocktails that come with it. This place you have here is incredible. <br><br>We had five drinks. The Three Dots and a Dash, Jet Pilot, Banana Daiquiri, Puka Puka Punch, and the Seyoney. My favorites were the Jet Pilot and the Three Dots and a Dash. The flavors and garnishes of these drinks were top notch. The hint of fresh nutmeg in the Three Dots and a Dash shows you the care given to each drink by the head mixologist/owner Paul. Fresh, pure, and tranquil is how I would describe what Paul and his staff are concocting. See, when you have a great tropical drink it is supposed to transport you away like a good book or a movie. Paul's cocktails do just that, one sip and looking at the beauty of the garnishes whisked me away to a beach with white sand with palm trees all around for shade. <br><br>The ambiance sets you up for your imaginary ride to utopia. The design is simple and not over done. Walking down the stairs was my only issue because I had my 76 year old dad with me. No worries I would have strapped him on my back to get him here. Lol. <br><br>Service was excellent. Paul enjoyed listening to my dad's stories of the Mai-Kai and we even suggested that he add two drinks made famous by the Mai-Kai, their Barrel of Rum and the Black Magic. <br><br>As we climbed the stairs to leave the door opened up and reality set in. It was still light out and we walked into a concrete jungle of an alleyway. Chicago is a beautiful town but I so much wanted to turn right around and go back downstairs to paradise.

He asked if we wanted a table or the bar, since it was just my friend and myself we wanted to sit at the bar to watch the amazing talented bar staff. Unfortunately we didn't find any open seats, so we went back to the host stand where the manager took us to a table. As we were being sat we asked to grab a table in front of the bar so we could get a closer look. He promptly moved us and we were immediately greeted by a very sweet server (I didn't get her name....she kind of reminded me of Sofia Vergara). She asked us if we've ever been here before and then gave us some recommendations, the house favorites and popular items as well. My friend who loves gin ordered the Saturn (amazing gin tiki cocktail with passion fruit, Orgeat and Falernum) and I ordered the Aku Aku Lapu (it's for two people but I didn't care it looked to amazing. It had Jamaican Rum, Mezcal, Arrack....I love Batavia Arrack, and pineapple.....so good I drank the whole thing). We ordered the Crab Rangoon and the Crispy Wings (both were great, I will definitely order them again). After she took our order she came right back with plates, napkins, utensils, and dipping sauces that she explained. Right after that....like 5 minutes it seemed, the two dishes we ordered came out. About 5 minutes later our drinks came out........ITS TIKI, IT TAKES TIME PEOPLE!!!!<br>Everything tasted amazing!

These royal blue skulls as you walk down the basement of this alley where the actual restaurant is located, now those skulls were fun. Then they have this lounge where people wait to be seated, also kind of fun, and even where the actual restaurant is, definitely tropical but not overdone.

Okay let's get to everything else.<br><br>When we walked in on a Saturday night around 6:30pm it was packed, and I don't like the idea that they take reservations for some nights on open table and not for others, but whatever. The hostess said you can have one table and by this point it's already like 6:45pm but we have to promise to be out by 8:15pm. I figured okay why not, otherwise we would have to wait an hour or so just to be seated. We took the nice table in a corner booth and got comfortable. Our server approached us right away and took our drink order. I have to say the cups that the drinks are served in are pretty freaking cool, definitely the best part of the place. I ordered the Mai Tai but not the one on the menu, one that is a new drink served with tequila instead of rum called the pinky gonzales or something, and I did like it. I didn't love it, but thought it was a decent drink that I would order again if I was here since I'm a tequila girl all the way. My husband got the \"A lonely island lost in the middle of a foggy sea\" made with rum, cold brew coffee, pineapple, lime and some other things and I have to say, we both tasted it and thought it was gross. It's only saving grace was that it's soo strong so the more you drank it, the more you started to like it...but he hated it, in fact in retrospect he should have asked the server for another drink instead of not enjoying your $13 concoction. Our friends that were with us got the Three dots and a dash drink and the Painkiller No 3 which was not served in a pineapple mug. That was disappointing. <br><br>Okay, so after having these very strong drinks, you get the munchies so we ordered a few things for the 4 of us to share and I looked at the prices and I thought, they aren't pricey, not bad. But the portions were TINY, like I never complain about small portions, but I think they need to be up'd a size or two considering they come with these huge, strong drinks. We got the pineapple guacamole with these yucky chips, they should really consider doing plantain chips, and for $9 it's like a spoon of guac. We got the coconut shrimp and you get a total of 6 shrimp and they weren't jumbo, and were more like fried shrimp instead of coconut. We also got the thai fried chicken which was my favorite dish and I def. recommend it, but once again, super small portion, enough for one person to nibble on, and not to share with 4 people. However, that kind of comfort food goes well with the drinks. Overall, the place is fun, the service was okay, the drinks were decent but strong and the food portions were too small. I don't know if I'm dying to go back, but definitely wouldn't want to wait over an hour here.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YZLyVjMAMkFYbtaFkXrQRA/348s.jpg", "caption": "A few of their tasty drinks"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "This place is AWESOME!

They were all so tasty but I think my favorite was the Boogie Board. The banana flavor may be a bit too much in Bunny's unless you really enjoy banana! I was surprised to see all the comments about the price of the drinks. Yeah, they're about $13/each but they were very strong and much more work goes into these then your average rum and coke! I thought the prices were very reasonable for River North and especially because the drinks were strong.<br><br>Appetizers - flaming shrimp and tuna crisp. It's fun that they flambe the shrimp tableside. Both were delicious. <br><br>Service - prompt and friendly! The server found out it was my mom's birthday and offered to bring over a birthday shot :) Not my mom's cup of tea so the server replaced a shot with sorbet which was the perfect finish to drinks and appetizers here.<br><br>I've since been back with my husband and he also really enjoyed Three Dots.

We were told that parties must show up together or else the late comers wait with the crowd; they have typically long lines (there were 30 people waiting outside at one point). No worries however because the host was very accommodating and understanding and allowed two sets of friends to come in later on in the evening with no problems and even gave us extra chairs to make sure we were comfortable.

I mean when someone tells you how they walked down a torch-lined alleyway, ended up in a tropical basement bar and swiftly browned out on elaborate island drinks in painted skull mugs, it sounds like they were deeper in the sauce than they are letting on. But last night some of my friends and I ended up here and I realized that it's real and it's pretty awesome!<br><br>We went around 7pm and had a reservation (go early with a reservation! It was the only way this would have worked for us because even though it was the first 80+ degree day of the year, people were still flocking to hang out in this basement bar). Walking in we were kind of giddy looking around at all the cool tiki decor and that we were finally here. When we sat down we immediately decided the best tactic was to all order different things and sample and we laughed at the little skulls next to the extra strong drinks. Let's get this straight - even the drinks without the skull are strong. But it's still a cute idea. I really liked both of the drinks that I ordered: the Siboney and the Dead Wreckoning. My friends' drinks were really good as well - especially the banana daquiri. I would order that or the dead wreckoning if I return<br><br>We didn't really know the food situation here so we planned on eating dinner, which I wouldn't reccommend because they don't have a huge menu and it's mostly snacks. That said, we loved all the apetizers we shared and if you don't mind that kind of meal then it's great. We had the luau chips, spring rolls, crab rangoon, and cocomut shrimp - all nice accompaniments to the cocktails. I would try the other stuff on the menu since the people at the table next to us seemed to order one of everything and some of the other things looked awesome. <br><br>Overall, the theme is fun and the service was fine but I don't think this will be a regular hangout for me. The stuff is a little pricey, although good (average prices for normally overpriced River North but I'm too much of a lush to spend $13 per cocktail unless I'm taking it easy) and since it's in a basement, it must be a great tropical escape in the winter but I'll be sticking to more patios and rooftops once summer eventually arrives for good.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nrbeQghrNEYkCzD3ac6W9g/168s.jpg", "caption": "Dead wreckoning in the front, surrounded by other drinks"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "This place is amazing.<br>The spring rolls are finger lickin' good and so are the drinks.<br>Loved the dolphin banana.<br>Also thought it was cool how it was hidden in a back alley and through a rednecky bar.<br>Very nice...cant wait to go back.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Horrid management.  @ 9:30 on a super cold Wednesday night...Tables are full, no waitress in site.  The bar is full and additional patrons waiting for a drink.  NO menu and pictured menu on site nor you can ask for one.  Some section of the venue is closed off.  All packed on one side of the room and NO service.  Only 4 competent bartenders (2 at front and 2 in back) to service 800 sq ft of patrons.<br><br>Good luck getting a drink...wait is at least 30 mins for a menu, prolly another 30 to find a person to place an order.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Very cool tiki bar in Chicago.

To get drinks, you have two options: Wait at the guard rails and the waitresses, dressed in floral print dresses, will take your order, but on a Saturday night, they're usually busy serving the bachelorette parties. Your second option is to squeeze in between the patrons at the bar. You may have to flirt/charm your way in, or be prepared to break up large groups and get dirty looks. <br><br>TDD is known for its atmosphere: Its underground, dimly-lit, and decorated with both tropical paradise-themed (think tiki bar) decorations and skulls.

He was also willing to make some off the menu drinks.<br>I love the way he's about to bring in alcohols you just never see in Tiki. They usually really work. Although he has the more typical Tiki where the drinks are rum and fruit driven with good complexity, he's doing wonderful drier drinks. You taste the fruit, but there's bitter elements that cause to drink to taste far more dry.<br>On my second visit I just enjoyed watching the ladies make drinks. The place was very busy, but not so full they were in danger of having to start creating a line. Everything they make just has so many ingredients. It's like watching a ballet as they make two drinks at a time with only a couple items in common.<br>My only recommendation is to come Sunday-Wednesday and skip the busy days.

The sauce on the ribs were so tasty that I licked them clean. Those were my favorites. We also enjoyed the coconut shrimp, springrolls, chips (more like pork rinds) with guacamole, and tuna. The chips for the tuna were a bit too seasoned for our liking but we ate them all anyway.

Even though the address is 435 Clark St., Bub City is actually located at that address.

The truth needs to be told here.<br><br>If you don't like the drinks at a certain bar, then that's respectable. However, there are certain comments that just make no sense and defy logic. For instance, when people (as some on here have done about Three Dots and a Dash) complain about a two hour wait, that's just a dumb comment. Why? Any bar/lounge that is really good is GOING to have a two hour wait on a Friday and a Saturday night. What makes you think that you are going to walk into a hot nightspot and not have to wait? You should be concerned if you walk into a Friday/Saturday nightspot and you DON'T have to wait at all because the place is empty. <br><br>Another personal favorite comment of mine is when we got there, the bar was crowded and we couldn't get anywhere near it. Guess what? That's what happens when you go on a Saturday night! When I read these comments, I really shake my head because many people lack this thing called common sense. I shouldn't have to say what I am about to say in the following paragraph, but I guess I have to educate the slow people when it comes to nightlife.<br><br>Like I have always tried to tell people, you should really avoid going to any bar on Friday and Saturday nights because of the potential long lines outside as well as the crowded atmosphere. If you want a good experience, go Sunday through Thursday. However, if you must tempt fate and go on a Friday or Saturday, then get there early, preferably when it opens. Don't go at midnight because, again, it's going to be crowded. Even when it comes to Sunday, get there when it opens. We got to Three Dots and a Dash at 5:10 PM on a Sunday, and the bar was already crowded.<br><br>I've been to many bars and restaurants all over this country, and the aforementioned rules apply ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. So, before you complain, at least learn the rules. Again, if you don't like the drinks and Three Dots and a Dash, that's respectable. However, if you complain about it being crowded, then your comments are pointless.<br><br>With all of that said, go to Three Dots and a Dash.

VERY bad service is not really even the start and overpriced unimpressive drinks. <br><br>To start I had high hopes for this place as some people had told me how amazing it was. So when I walked down the stairway to the entry I was definitely starting off impressed. Let me assure you it did not last long. <br><br>I arrived in a party of 2 on a Monday night around 7pm and the place was pretty empty. There where MANY tables available through the entire time we where waiting for a table. I was told that there was nothing available when arriving and that we could put are names on a list. We never got a table the entire time we waited and drank which was about an hour. We where never asked if we wanted food which we did. <br><br>After been told we where on a list the fun began. So with normal expectation of a 15 min wait we walked over to the very full bar area even though there where 15-20 table seats empty and most of them stayed empty for the full hour we where there. I guess there thing is make people wait for seats. So we sat down and waited and waited and waited ..... So as we waited to order drinks I was informed that I was standing to close to the side of the bar and the server decided to move the rope so close to me I could hardly move with out falling over. So after almost getting my legs roped off and waiting 20 min for the bar tender Lisa to ignore us completely and serve even new arrivals to the bar with out even looking at us. After removing the rope from behind my legs and complaining that we had been waiting for not only a drink and a place to sit as we had not yet even been able to sit down. The manager did come over after the 30 min mark and give us an extra stool for the bar after I stopped another server and asked if there where actually reservations for the large number of empty seats on a Monday night. The manager did come over and asked if everything was ok. It wasn't until then that we where able to order a drink about 30 min after arriving. We then waited another 10 min to actually get are drinks. Are server still didn't ask if we wanted to order any food the whole hour we where there. I would say that I am not surprised to get bad service down town but I was definitely not impressed by anything about the bar, drinks, severed, staff or operations. <br><br>The drinks where overpriced and I have had better at other tiki bars. My opinion the whole bar is just a unauthentic gimmick to be able to charge crazy prices doe mixed drinks. For what you get in your cup I have been to a lot better locations and had a lot better frozen drinks. To top it all off the server took my drink before I even got to finish it and threw out at least 1:4 of my $16 mixed drink. If your looking to wait a long time for overpriced drinks and be completely underwhelmed then this is your place. I would suggest that you skip this place completely and just go down the street to Fado for a nice beer.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "My kind of bar!

I've been to only 1 Tiki bar (Tonga Room in SF) and loved it, so when I walked in (and down, it's underground) here I was in awe. The place is decked out in sweet tiki decor! The top of the bar is lined with what looks like part of the roof of a hut and there are huge beautiful totem pole looking piece throughout.<br><br>The ambiance is dim and intimate but with a little of a spooky vibe, which is perfect. One thing I didn't like was the music. When we walked in they were playing some more ambiguous music, some unknown reggae-type stuff, etc. which was fine. But then they switched into mid-2000's hip-hop (think old Common, etc.) and it really completely destroyed the vibe. Some people nodded their heads, but I don't think that means it's the best option -- a fellow visitor agreed with me. I did however appreciate that it was loud enough I could hear it, to give the space some vibrance, however I could still talk to friends without shouting too much, which is important as this place is primarily a sit down place.<br><br>The music situation really put a damper on the vibe for me, and is the primary reason for the star off, though another reason was because the service was really slow, to the point that even if we wanted another round after it taking ~20 minutes to order and receive the first round, I would go for the check rather than another round. To be fair, this could just be a kink with it being opening night and all. Our waitress was extremely nice and even brought us all a round of water without us asking, so we definitely appreciated that.<br><br>The drinks are $13 each, great tasting and -very- strong as traditional Tiki drinks are! Half the menu is Tiki classics and half are modern twists on old Tiki cocktails. Part of the menu is also for large shareable drinks. All the drinks come served in very interesting looking glasses, many with scary type faces, some are porcelain coconuts, etc. And if you really love one, you can buy one from them -- a nice touch for the tourists! I had the Halekulani which was boozy yet smooth and a little creamy ... it was delicious. I also tried a friend's \"Jet Pilot\" which is marked with a skull on the menu to signify alcohol potency! It too was very good, with a slight bitter turn but it wasn't too intense.<br><br>I didn't get a good look at the food menu but it seemed small and inconsequential.<br><br>All in all, I loved this place and will be back very soon to try all the drinks. The decor and drinks are the star at this underground Tiki joint.

The drink was superb, not even a touch of sweetness and blended beatifully with the rum. It was the strongest drink I had all night and I would come back just to enjoy the Mai Tai again. <br><br>The other cocktails we had were also superb. The Rum River Mystic, which appeared to be a take on the Vieux Carre, except with Puerto Rican rum substituted for the brandy. It was dry, bitter and simply outsanding. <br><br>We ordered practically the entire food menu and enjoyed the luau chips and pork belly buns. The chips are actually puffed rice reminiscent of pork rinds in appearance and served with a bowl of guacamole. The buns reminded me of the favorite menu item at Takashi, but sadly not nearly as savory and addicting. I thought the chicken curry skewers and Thai fried chicken were rather uninspiring. What food here lacks is spice, plain and simply. Add some chile to the Thai fried chicken and it would pop. <br><br>Unfortunately the food here plays second fiddle to the cocktails. And it should.

This one has bourbon, passionfruit, pomegranate and lemon. <br>4) Siboney: Probably my favorite of all the drinks--instead of a cool mug it's served in a glass cup...I'd order 10 of these. <br>5) Bunny's banana daquiri: Mm!! This tastes like a banana shake, lol no joke. I feel like I could have this after a workout!!

My favorite was the cherries that tasted like they had been aged in bourbon or rum. Between this and a Bloody Mary, one could also make a meal out of their drinks...I digress. The spot is dark and the whir of a blender punctuates conversation. If you're looking for an exotic escape in a glass, come here.

I had one person over the max before having to sign a contract tract at my table so there was a minimum I needed to spend within two hours. When we were one hour in I asked our waitress if we're able to put purchasing their cups towards our total to make our minimum and came back, twice, and told me yes. She has told us when we sat down that if we needed ANYTHING to let her know-we either did not get her name or she didn't tell us. After thirty minutes being handed a total of three cups, two different times of confirming it could go towards our total,  a manager came with only 30min left to drink and eat to tell me that was false information and I need to spend $120 more ... in less than 30min to make the minimum. After speaking with him, Kurt, he told me that the waitress should have known that it was not going to be ok for us to put purchases toward the cups and it could only be towards door and drinks, 15min conversation on explaining what his waitress told us and nothing to compromise with the miscommunication they had led us to. He told and interrupted me I was getting \"More upset than I needed to be\" when I was simply explaining to him that what was the complete conversation. I said we would forfeit the rest and just pay for it the rest because it was poorly communicated to us when I explained that we had been drinking and eating all day so we didn't think we wanted to eat or drink anything else. When I said, there was only 15min left at this point we couldn't drink $120 more alcohol and it was unreasonable to think we  could, he said \"it would be a loss for us to not spend it\" and we wouldn't have a table anymore to be drinking at... so why he kept encouraging more alcohol/alcohol poison was beyond me when I already accepted the loss of the amount left for the minimum. There's absolutely no effort to compromise or apologize for his waitresses poor lack of knowledge of the contract (the only comment he as to say was \"she should have known better\" and when I specifically asked about adding the purchases to our total he did not say well I can put one of the three towards your total) NOTHING polite that could have been nicely handled that would have made EVERYONE'S last thirty minutes better like -this isn't our policy and I apologize for the miscommunication, I can honor it this once because my associate told you wrong- <br>A situation could have been handled better and my friends who travelled hundreds and thousands of miles from Canada and Ohio could have had a better first time experience in a Chicago, at a very well known bar, but instead they had that. <br>After speaking to the manager we ended up getting one more large drink and the waitress was not sociable or apologetic to us for her miscommunication. She gave me the check and walked away shyly. We had left disappointed in how they all left our table because they did not make that effort to make a bad situation better. As a person who is a manager myself, I know that there were definitely better ways he could have communicated with me-the tipping point was telling I was that I was \"more upset than I needed to be\" because a manager should never tell a customer they are any kind of emotion-especially when the customer is consuming alcohol...that was not professional and we will not be going back or telling anyone to go there. After spending $12-$15 a drink and $65-$85 on large group drinks, you would think the management would be more receptive to the miscommunication or apologize for their associate's lack of knowledge-not blame it on them and give absolutely no reason for the customer to come back... <br>happy birthday, to me.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Awesome fun Tiki Bar !

THIS PLACE IS THE TRUTH! I'm a Miami girl so I know my clubs. lounges, and bars like the back of my hand. I was on vacation in Chicago for Valentine's day weekend. My guy and I found this place on Yelp. And I'm glad we did. It's located on an alley off a main street. Getting in was so easy, I envy Chicagoans, I want to take time to give a shout out to the bouncer at the door. The guy was so cool and nice, I am definitely not used to that in Miami! Stay gold bouncer dude at the door. As soon as you walk in there's a small entry way that leads you to a staircase that takes you underground. The place was packed at around 9PM! Again, where I come from clubs and lounges don't start getting good (filled with people) till about midnight. It was refreshing to come to a place like this. The dress code was all over, I saw girls in club attire and others in jeans and a t-shirt, again this is a plus. The drinks are a little pricey, BUT there is a good amount of alcohol in them. The attraction here are the dinks and the décor. The drinks are very elaborate and come with special effects! We ordered a \"Bali Bali\" that was on the menu for a limited time and it came with dry ice smoke and lights. Very beautiful and sooooo worth the 35 bucks (It's meant to be shared between two people). If you are in Chicago, go, trust me you will love it. I secretly want to go back to Chicago so that I can go to this lounge. The only weird thing for me was the music selection, the DJ was not very good at mixing music or genres. One minute you have R. Kelly with ignition then the next you hear Cuban Salsa queen Celia Cruz belting out tunes. That was the only iffy thing, but this is easily overlooked as this is more of a place to have drinks with friends and have conversations.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ddSABM1PPvyRGQy90B10rw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Omfg!

This place probably has its fair share of reservations and people in the know because I doubt  anyone just happens to walk by it and go in.

All of them were tropical and refreshing and came in very cute mugs and glasses with pretty garnishes. My only complaint was that my drink, the Siboney, was a lot smaller than my friends' drinks and still cost the same ($13). Though thinking about it now, I don't think mine came with any ice, so that may have been why the glass was so much smaller. <br><br>The food that they serve is only small plates, so we got the Crab Rangoon and Thai Fried Chicken to share, which was really good. The Crab Rangoon was crispy and came with 4 different sauces, which were all good. The Thai Fried Chicken was my favorite and was more like boneless wings than fried chicken. It was drenched in a garlic-chili sauce that was really delicious and had a nice kick to it.

The entryway is cool but a little congested, maybe it's because you MUST stop and look at the skulls on the wall and at the private space off to the side, it's pretty spectacular.<br><br> The host asked if we had reservations which they do accept since they also serve food but we did not. We were able to snag some awesome seats at the corner of the bar so that we could see everything. The drink menu is cute (I folded one up and stashed in my purse, sorry!). The drinks are split into three categories: traditional, modern, and group drinks. They also have some beer and wine but why would you do that?! Since it was just the two of us, we skipped the group drinks but they did look pretty awesome. I ordered the Bunny's Banana Daiquiri and it was frozen but fabulous, they used an entire banana and it was blended to order. My bf got the Painkiller number 3 and it was also fabulous, with strong pineapple flavor. The gimmick here is that every drink has its own particular glass and design which you can purchase. I do not believe that the drinks are worth $13 each but you are paying for the ambiance and the location at best they are worth $10-11.<br><br>This place is super cute and reminded me of a few places I visited in Hawaii last year and it was warm!

The Poipu Beach Boogie Board, which was a wipe-out because... I guess the drinks are indescribable--you just have to try yours, try your friend's and get another round of something different.

The drinks are strong and very tasty.  I did not find the drinks overly syrupy, like I've found with many tiki drinks I've had in the past.  I found the service to be friendly and laid back.  If in the area, this is a place to certainly check out.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Coming here is an adventure. The entrance is in a back alley in downtown, and while it may be obvious where it's located on a weekend when the line stretches down the block, it can be difficult to find on a weekday evening although that's the best time to go since there's no crazy line. My Chicago-native friend led me here with a group and I got to try some amazing drinks. I got a Mai Tai for myself, which was good but in retrospect I should've ordered something more creative. I had the opportunity to try The Saturn and the Tall As A Tree And Twice As Shady, which were both bomb as in crazy amazing. The Jet Pilot was also good but crazy strong. I really want to try everything on their menu eventually. I also aspire to be rich enough to order the treasure chest here one day.<br><br>One of my friends said he came here, ordered a drink, and felt duped because the menu showed a cartoon pineapple and his drink came in a ceramic pineapple, but he expected to receive a real pineapple.

At this time, it's still pretty empty. We were greeted by a cheerful waitress, who gladly explained the concept of the restaurant, talked about the owner, and her favorites of the food menu, and recommendations on the drink menu. We liked how she explained slowly- not in a rush, and answered our questions with details. <br><br>I don't remember the names of our drinks, but my advice is, because there are so many, ask about your favorite type of drink and then get recommendations. I like pina coladas and my friend likes moscow mules, so we went with similarities to those drinks. If you get any food- get the thai chicken, the sweetness melts in your mouth, and the crunch adds the perfect textures, and the 4 different sauces are the perfect pairings with the wings. And the price is decent, but please skip out on the guacamole, it's really small and not tasty. And as great as the lava chips are, they are full of sodium, and my friend couldn't even finish. <br><br>Excellent service- this was impressive. But it was because we weren't there on a crazy packed night where you have to wait in line. Our plates were being picked up, we were asked if we wanted anything else, and how everything was. We weren't pressured with anything. It was a relaxing, enjoying time. The drinks are amazing- strong and pretty. I was escaping to Hawaii with every sip I took. When I come back, I want to get the coconut shrimp. <br><br>I feel that the problem with people is that they hear of 3 dots and a dash- and make reservations on a busier evening or just wait in line and then because they are mixology type of drinks, it takes forever to get one, and then the bartenders are not in the best mood on top of wait staff. <br><br>So I'll definitely come back, but I'll be smart about when and what time I do just like I did this for this visit!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "There's not many places in the city that make me feel like a million bucks, but this is definitely one of them.

That's the only bad thing about the location of the entrance.<br><br>Just a forewarning-- food and drinks are a little pricey but high quality, and you are paying for the ambiance as well, which is unique.. it's beautiful (but DARK). Also, most of the drinks are very strong, so they're really worth the price. I recommend the Painkillers. Off the food menu, I love the coconut shrimp. <br><br>The bartenders are extremely talented and the service is usually pretty good for a bar that is often packed Thurs-Sat.

Small portions/tapas style so order more if you're hungry. <br><br>There are also 4 different large drinks that you can order to share with a group!
