We were seated and the menu was explained to us by our server. Water and bread were brought to the table immediately - there was olive oil on the table with salt and pepper but no other spices or balsamic vinegar. Dipping bread in olive oil wasn't my jam so I left it to my partner. We ordered a pitcher of the black raspberry sangria and absolutely enjoyed it throughout our meal. <br><br>We ordered the Potato and Onion Omelette and the Goat Cheese Baked with Tomato Sauce. The omelette was served with what I believe was a garlic aioli, not bad overall but nothing to write home about. <br><br>The Goat Cheese Baked with Tomato Sauce was served with crispy, thinly-sliced garlic bread - I thoroughly enjoyed this dish and once I ran out of the garlic crisps, I used the bread table to finish the remainder of the dish. <br><br>We ordered the chicken paella - their paella is priced per serving with a minimum of two servings to order. Kind of a bummer if you are interested in a different type of paella than other people at your table. The paella itself was a little salty but good. <br><br>We were there for a date and the servers were a little too attentive for my taste. I felt like we were being checked in on every 5 minutes - just a bit much for me but that's a personal preference. <br><br>Overall, great atmosphere and good food.

We heard great things about this place before coming here but overall, we felt many tapa dishes fell short of our expectation. The only notable mentions were the fried potatoes, omelet, and paella mixtas. We really didn't like the fried chicken that was drenched post-frying in some overly pungent sweet and sour sauce. The bacon wrapped in dates was another major miss as the combined taste profile just didn't make much sense and tasted strange. Also didn't make sense was the order size as each order of the bacon skewer consisted of only a single piece. What were they thinking for something so simple yet not very good!?

There's free dessert with your yelp check-in!<br><br>While all of the dishes we got were absolutely delicious, my three favorites were the garlic shrimp, squid, and the hanger steak. The shrimp was cooked to perfection and was a blast of flavor the moment you put it in your mouth, yet not overwhelming. I'm not the biggest fan of garlic, but the combination with lemon and the pepper flakes gave it the perfect kick of spice and tang. The same went with the squid, which was chewy and tender. While this seems simple, many places serve it way too chewy making it hard to tear apart and swallow. The hanger steak - nice and medium rare, tender, and full of flavor. <br><br>I loved that the portions were just right.

Brussels Sprouts Salad was surprisingly good. I usually don't like raw brussels sprouts, but I enjoyed this salad. The Octopus a la Plancha was pretty mediocre, which I found surprising considering that I love octopus and I expected them to knock this one out of the park. The Shrimp with Garlic, Olive Oil, Red Pepper Flakes on the other hand was delicious, and I think we went with 2 or 3 orders of this. I'm not a fan of blue cheese but the others at my table enjoyed the Beef Tenderloin & Blue Cheese. The Grilled Hanger Steak was also a hit among us. Someone ordered a Beef Empanada and really liked it. <br><br>We definitely ordered more plates than just this... I think our final bill came out around $300 after tax and tip.

Our second waiter didn't seem to know the menu very well. We asked for recommendations because there were so many tasty options, but he seemed to read over my shoulder to recommend the dishes already highlighted in red on the menu. <br><br>-Paella with confit pork shoulder, crispy pork belly, chorizo, and chicharrones<br>The description sounded bomb. The reality featured a dry yet oily, under-spiced rice with really dry meat. It was just very, very far from my idea of a moist, pleasant paella.<br><br>-Grilled Octopus<br>The flavors of this confused me. I felt like the greens on the plate were frivolous. They did not enhance the octopus, and their texture didn't work well make one cohesive bite. The octopus on the other hand was cooked very well, but the flavors were subtle and a rather unidentifiable. The concept for the dish has so much potential, but the execution of it was too all scattered to be enjoyable. <br><br>-Short rib<br>If I had to relate this to something in terms of flavor, this reminded me a bit of the taste of a canned beef stew. It was tender and flavorful though.<br><br>-Grilled Hanger Steak<br>The highlight of this one were the mushrooms. There were seasoned so well and had great texture. I could have eaten a bowl of just these mushrooms. The steak was also delicious. <br><br>-Buttermilk fried Chicken<br>The sauce is a bit like a buffalo hot sauce, but more subtle. I'm not a huge fan of buffalo sauce, I find it to be a bit too acidic. The chicken was cooked very well though. Given my bias, it was just A-OK. <br><br>The inconsistencies in the meal kept me from giving Café Ba-ba-reeba a higher rating, and although I had a lot of constructive criticism of the tapas, the tapas were tasty and deserving of 4 stars.

Or maybe I've only eaten small dates before? The saltiness of the chorizo perfectly complemented the sweetness of the date and tanginess of cheese.<br><br>Seared Cana de Cabra with onion jam & membrillo honey - A thick crostini topped with a large smear of creamy goat cheese, onion jam, and honey. The flavors worked well together too.<br><br>The only dish I wouldn't order again was the Buttermilk-Fried Chicken Thighs with piri-piri sauce & shaved vegetable salad.

They have a wonderful Moroccan chickpea stew that's very comforting especially during the winter time.

Brussels Sprout Salad, Marcona Almonds, Manchego Cheese - this was OK, not impressed as the simple dish above. I did like that they shredded the brussels sprouts that it is not overwhelming. It was bit dry, but not terrible. <br>3. Garlic Potato Salad - this was very good and tasty. I would only recommend to order one potato dish because it does become overwhelming with too many potatoes. <br>4. Goat Cheese Baked in Tomato Sauce - this was delicious. I loved how it was such a simple dish that is very tasty. They give you a herbed and butter bread with it to dip or top the goat cheese on. It was nice it warm!<br>5. Burrata with Catalan Tomato Bread - I love burrata. I always have to order it if it is on the menu. This was nothing different from any other burrata from any other place, but since it is my favorite cheese, i liked it. <br>6. Spinach & Manchego-Stuffed Mushrooms - this was the best dish of the night. This was a nice warm, baked mushroom stuffed with cheese and spinach - YUM!!!<br>7.

We were informed of an almost two hour wait, and while thinking about what we wanted to do, the hostess had a party of 4 cancel a reservation and we were able to be seated immediately. I have never ever been so lucky at a restaurant like that, what are the odds!?<br><br>We had a quiet little nook of a table in between the two dining rooms. One thing I must say about Café Ba-Ba-Reeba is that is it HUGE! There are multiple rooms, a ton of patrons as well as waitstaff; people were still being seated for reservations at 9:30pm. It's quite an experience to watch all the different foods and people coming and going, definitely one of the busiest restaurants I've ever seen. Super cool inside, it has a rustic Spanish/European feel to it but nice energy as well.<br><br>We started with a pitcher of the daily special sangria. That night it was a mango apple one, which was amazing, dangerously easy to drink and we all got at least 2 full glasses worth of it.<br><br>We only wanted a little bit to eat so we got 5 plates between the 4 of us. Started with the brussels sprout salad. I thought it was really good, the nuts and cheese blended together well. My mother thought it was dry but I did not agree it needed much, maybe a little olive oil (already on the table) but still, not really.<br><br>Then came the garlic bread with tomato sauce and baked goat cheese. This was really good as well, super creamy cheese and it went nicely with the acidic tomato sauce, the bread was crispy.<br><br>After the garlic bread was the short rib. This was a bigger portion plate and it was good as well. I must admit it is hard to impress me with short ribs because I've had some excellent ones in the city. This Rioja-braised one from Ba-Ba-Reeba was only good, but did not wow me. The carrots and potatoes went well with it.<br><br>Then came the grilled iberico pork with chimichurri. I really enjoyed this one, the chimichurri was potent, very garlicky with a celery flavor too that went well with the tender pieces of pork.<br><br>Lastly we ordered the sea scallops. They took a very long time to come out, but were delicious. Perfectly seared over an acorn squash puree, I liked them a lot.<br><br>I forgot our server's name but he was cheery and fun, a very good representation of Café Ba-Ba-Reeba itself!<br><br>Overall a very good experience here.

Something told me to call and see if they were packed seeing all the reviews that had been posted, I could tell they were a popular spot. Good thing I did because the wait was 1.5 hours. However, they do call ahead seating. This was great and they put our name on the list. When we got there we walked in, checked in and a nice couple was leaving the first come tables in the bar.

Honestly this dish was not anything special. It was mushrooms with sauce, spinach, a little cheese on top and bread crumbs. The flavors/ingredients didn't really go together or flow. It honestly just tasted like mushrooms and cream sauce. Nothing special and my husband who loves mushrooms wasn't even crazy about them.

Does it live up to the hype? Not quite. I came for brunch for restaurant week and was impressed by the variety on the menu, the insane bloody mary bar and the physical space. As a tapas restaurant, Ba Ba Reeba offers every little taste you could ever need for a weekend brunch... sweet, savory, spicy, you name it. SO, you know that huge internal debate you have when there's pancakes/waffles versus scrambled eggs and hash on the menu? Here, you can take both sides by ordering a bunch of their pinxtos (small bites) and sharing brunch tapas! The bloody bar, which costs $10, is well worth the price- you get your choice of booze (Grey Goose is the same price as Ketel One, HA!) and as many accoutrements as you can fit in your glass. Cocktail shrimp, olives, pickles, spices, hot sauce, celery, pearl onions, tomatoes, garlic, salami, and your choice of gazpacho or tomato juice. Basically, just stuff your glass with shrimp and call it a day! The food we ordered was tasty in general, but everything was too rich- the waffle-battered chicken stick was basically a greasy chicken sausage corn dog.The Ibérico ham hash was also too greasy, salty and overall heavy. My favorite dish was probably the citrus french toast, but even that was too much on its own (the goat cheese butter, while great in contrast to the honey-covered toast, was pretty overpowering). Even thought the food wasn't the best, the place is worth visiting for the experience. It's HUGE and really does have a Spanish courtyard vibe.

The night before, we compiled a list of numbers we wanted to order ahead of time. We were given a lunch and brunch menu, but all the numbers we chose weren't on there. Where's #41 - anchovies and #43 - the fried green peppers?!?! Rest assured our awesome server, Tim said anything goes if it's online. Now why in the world would they hide these delectable dishes? I'm sorry if anchovies and hot peppers offend you. Maybe that's why those numbers are invisible during lunch/brunch hours.<br><br>The build your own bloody mary bar seemed interesting as you can put whatever skewer shit you want in there as the server gives you a shot a vodka. I saw a guy with like 6 skewers jammed in his cup! Where we were seated, I don't think I would've made it down the stairs, to the left, between all the tables, servers running around, just to get to the corner of the bar without falling after my BAC is probably above the legal limit in my state. I settled with the classic red sangria which wasn't too sweet, quite strong, and topped with fruit. It was tasty and I soon found out I felt buzzed, walking down a few steps to the women's bathroom which had 3 stalls, 1 sink, and I couldn't effing see anything in there let alone find the TP in the stall. The girls line was long when I came out. I'm assuming these girls had one too many drinks and needed to tinkle bad like me.<br><br>Drunkness aside. The food was FANTASTIC imho. Anchovies topped with an olive tapenade paired well with the complimentary bread and evoo. Toasty catalan tomato bread topped with arugula and Manchego cheese triangles was delicious. The meatballs with sherry tomato sauce was simply divine as I sopped up the sauce with bread. If you go, the charcuterie plate (plato de la casa) is a must if you're a cured meat lover. We also ordered a breakfast paella which took about 30 minutes and was served sizzling hot table side. Well worth the wait. The bomba rice was perfectly cooked and I loved the crispy rice bits. The bill for 2 was about $100 w/tips, but we dined like a king and queen.<br><br>Was Ba-ba Reeba quick to deliver excitement?

Another green sauce (the piri piri I believe) also paste-like and grainy, at least had a bit more flavor. Every other dish was predictable. Every combination felt like the obvious choice.<br><br>I am also not generally into enormous restaurants. I didn't choose this place, but the interior is so large, so many rooms, huge staff, no intimacy. And sure enough, a high school group walked out as we were coming in. I think as a general rule, I am never going to like a restaurant that caters to a high school sports team. That to me, indicates a blandness and lack of creativity that would appeal to a wide range of people. I want food to challenge me, as well as satiate. Also, having an out of use enormous bar in the back room looked tacky. It felt like we were shuffled into the utility closet. The bar should either be fully set up or maybe have a curtain over it to hide the empty counter top.<br><br>I was also bemused by what I received when I ordered a vodka on the rocks. I was presented with a cup filled to the brim with ice chips. It was absurd. So much ice for no apparent reason. Idk who trained the bar to do that. Maybe it's a Chicago thing, but it was way too much and looked ridiculous. Another indication that this place is feigning sophistication. I wonder about the quality of ingredients.

This was on a long list of recommended brunch places our friends picked so we ended up choosing to come here and I'm very glad we did! <br><br>We got a table for six pretty easily around noon on Sunday. The layout of the restaurant is pretty fun and there are pretty deliberately sectioned off parts of the restaurant. We were ushered to the back right of the establishment. Just glancing at the menu I knew this was probably going to be a great brunch. That, and the fact that there is an \"!\" in the name of the restaurant makes me expect big things.<br><br>The menu was big. Like reallllly big. There were breakfast/brunch options on one side, and then more lunch/dinner options on the other. Lots of dishes to choose from. We split three pitchers of sangria between the six of us throughout the brunch and it was delicious. We got the regular house red and the white peach. They don't put way too much ice in their pitchers like you see at some places, for which everyone was thankful.<br><br>As for the food, you'd think with a menu so big, everything might be one note and taste the same. That's definitely what I was expecting going into it. That was not the case AT ALL. We probably sampled 12-14 dishes between the six of us and each dish was unique and had its own flavor.<br><br>Some standouts for me: The Pan Catalan, bacon mac and cheese, bacon wrapped dates, and the patatas bravas. All of these were incredibly tasty, and something I'd recommend you NEEDING to get while you're there. I thinkt the patatas bravas was my favorite. I've had them done a dozen different ways by different Spanish restaurants, but the sauce they put on them here really stuck out to me. It had a nice spicy kick but wasn't too much for people who aren't a huge fan of spice. Just really well done.<br><br>The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the shrimp and grits and the paella. The shrimp and grits were a little bland and the paella I thought was just sort of \"Meh.\" I'm not a huge paella fan so take that with a grain of salt.<br><br>With all the dishes we had and the sangria, I'm pretty sure we all got out of there for less than $40 a person which was incredible considering we all had our fill of drink, and were stuffed to the brim with food. It's probably not the first place you think of when you hear \"authentic Spanish cuisine\" but it's pretty damn good.

Greene) in NYC. Or even Spain? I've only lived in Andalucia (Southern Spain) and I think the comparison is similar to Chinese food in the US (babareeba) vs. Chinese food in China... <br><br>The Bloody Mary bar should be avoided at all costs. Even their \"spicy\" mix is just a tad spicy at best. Plus, the choices are overwhelming... your drink will just taste like tomato juice with random spices in it. <br><br>The food was just off.

I appreciate that they don't want to serve up traditional patatas, but this iteration tasted starchy, processed and strange. <br><br>2) Brussel sprout salad: This was admittedly the best dish from what I tried. However, the ratio of cheese and dressing to sprouts was off... So I felt inundated with the fixings, I could barely taste the sprouts. <br><br>3) Octopus: Check out my picture, does that look appetizing? It was overly oily and rubbery. My cousin had never tried octopus and I convinced him (Since I savor the octopus at Taverna Kyclades in Astoria, Queens and even Boqueria).

This provided enough food for everyone to share. <br><br>At my most recent dinner experience, we ordered the following:<br><br>chorizo-wrapped medjool dates and cheese-a popular tapa that reminded me of Avec's prosciutto-wrapped dates. <br><br>spicy potatoes with tomato aioli-one of my favorite tapas here and at Mercat a la Planxa. I prefer M a la P's patatas bravas over the spicy potatoes at CBBR, but for the price point, CBBR hits the spot. <br><br>grilled octopus-this was one of my favorites tapas at CBBR and I would order this again.

Not what you'd expect if you're a Nando's fan. This is a marriage of fried chicken doused in peri peri sauce. <br><br>grilled hanger steak-sliced for sharing, moist and succulent meat. <br><br>seafood paella with squid and squid ink-Our entire party's favorite dish, this is a special that should be made into a regular offering.

Some of the standouts for me were roast dates with bacon and burrata with bread and tomato marmalade. I'm a big fan of sweet/salty, and the flavors of both those dishes were richly complex. I also really liked the brussels sprouts salad, mixed greens salad, grilled squid, and the ham/chorizo plate. I could have done without the fried calamari or garlic potato salad, but I think other people liked it.

Sausages were good but nothing that really stood out for me and the buttermilk fried chicken was tasty but kind of out of place in my opinion for a Spanish tapas bar. My favorite was probably the braised short rib due to how tender and flavorful the meat was. The melon salad I really enjoyed the serranos and the smoked vinaigrette they used. The grilled octopus was good, but some of the pieces of octopus were had a bit too much char in my opinion. And lastly, for the pork paella... be ready for a mouthful of pork flavors and textures.

My husband and I also shared 1/2 pitcher of the pomegranate sangria that was a feature and it was phenomenal. 1/2 pitcher was about 3 glasses each as they are short glasses. A couple glasses of sangria and some tortilla and you'll feel as though you've been transported to a bar in Puerto del Sol. <br><br>The space is surprisingly big but I would still highly recommend a reservation to avoid an hours long wait.

Less busy on weekdays, usually no wait before 7PM.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Where do I even begin?  Everyone always asks me what my favorite restaurant is in the city, and almost always I say, \"I don't know, I have so many!\", but now I can give a definitive answer and tell the whole world that Café Ba-ba-reeba is one of my all-time favorites.  This restaurant totally hits it out the ballpark, and I would reccomend it to anyone and everyone.  Café Ba-ba-reeba is equivalent to the eight wonder of the world - can you tell that I love it here?<br><br>Like I said - where do I begin?  I suppose I can just start off by listing all the tapas thar we ordered, so here we go:<br>1. Potatoes and aioli<br>2. Spicy meatballs in sherry sauce<br>3. Beef empanada<br>4. Ham and chicken croquetas<br>5. Melted goat cheese in tomato sauce <br>6. Octopus with smoked potatoes<br><br>Although I could just lean back, relax and tell you that each of these were phenomenal, let me just give you a brief description of each tapa we ordered. The potatoes and aioli are simple, but amazing; the aioli is finger-lickin good (quite literally).  The meatballs are juicy, and the sauce they are in is wonderfully flavorful.  The beef empanada was like a meat filled croissant - it was awesome.  The croquetas were amazing - that's all.  The melted goat cheese in tomato sauce came with garlic bread and the flavor mixed perfectly together - this was one of the best deals as well.  And finally, the octopus tasted like they fetched it straight from the sea; it had all the salinity your heart could desire, not to mention it was chewy but tender in the most perfect way.  Biased as I may sound, all of these tapas are a \"must-get\".  Yes, there's so many others to choose from but these were freaking amazing.  <br><br>But hey, guess what?  The empanada, meatballs, croquetas and potatoes are all $3 or less during happy hour which is 4pm-6pm, Monday-Friday.  That way you can try more of their tapas for a little less money.  You can only take advantage of these happy hour deals if you sit in the bar area, but why not?  You still get the same great atmosphere and service when sitting in the bar so take advantage why don't ya?  <br><br>Now, I'm not done - oh no, not even close.  My fiancé and I got the seafood paella after all those tapas.  I had high expectations for the paella since my fiancé has said it's the best he's had, and I was anything but disappointed.  The paella exceeded my expectations, and I can say it is now my favorite paella as well.  The saffron is very distinct, but not overwheleming, and the seafood was cooked perfectly.  I had some left-over and it still tasted just as good the following day.  That's impressive.  I don't usually have a burning desire to go back to the same restaurant twice, but I'd go here 10x over to indulge in this paella.  <br><br>And after the paella, we had dessert - not one, but four to be precise (we pigged out just a little).  We had the black raspberry sorbet, caramelized bananas, natilla flan and the butterscotch mousse.  Don't even ask what my favorite one was there - they satisfied the sweet tooth like no other dessert ever has.  I'd say that you definitely should try the butterscotch mousse and the caramelized bananas...if you really have to choose.  Each dessert is only $3 and they're small so you should choose to get more than just one.<br><br>And finally (as if that wasn't enough, right?) We got a pitcher of sangria that lasted throughout the entire course of our meal.  That pitcher is huge, and it's not filled to the brim with ice so you truly are getting a whole lotta sangria.  We got the red sangria which is only $17 for a pitcher during happy hour - hell yeah!  The sangria was awesome, maybe a little too awesome since I walked outta that place a little tipsy.  We also got some Spanish beer that was on draft and it was also very good...and yes, I was double-fisting it for a bit there.<br><br>The atmosphere and the service made this dining experience even better.  The waiters and bussers were extremely attentive and always came through picking up our dirty plates.  We definitely didn't feel ignored, even though we weren't sitting in the main dining area.  In fact, it was kind of nice because it felt like private dining be for all the dinner crowd came.<br><br>Ultimately, we left in some pain because of all that we ate, but can say that we came, we saw and we conquered.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bTo6Kng1SvVKsBC5n_DnWw/348s.jpg", "caption": "With everything we ordered the bill came to a reasonable price"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Os-bl0EitA2gCzLvdy8eJQ/168s.jpg", "caption": "Vanilla flan...omg so good"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eXQ5LsF2QJrjMzdmtkBiIg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Butterscotch mousse"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "This place is one of the best in the city for Tapas style food.

And Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba was it. Brunch is fantastic, but I LOVE their dinners. Truly one of my favorite restaurants in the city. <br><br>I like the way they designed their menus with favorite items and/or chef recommendations highlighted in red. Because they do change the menu pretty frequently, it's nice to automatically know some of the newbies you should try. <br><br>Some things you should absolutely order:<br>-a pitcher of sangria. We shared it among 4 people and we each got two full glasses and then some. The pitcher costs $26, while a single glass costs $7. Huge savings, and well worth sharing among a small crowd. <br>-on the pinxtos menu, the date stuffed with cheese wrapped with chorizo is to die for. Embarrassingly enough, I always order 2-3 just for myself. They have something similar on the full size menu, but it's not identical, and these are sooooo fantastic that I don't even chance it. Get more than one. It's all of the flavors you would never expect to work that just do. <br>-spicy potatoes. They aren't over powering, and contain just the right amount of kick... And that chipotle mayo sauce is delicious!<br>-beef tenderloin with blue cheese = perfection. It's cooked medium rare and has a slightly salty taste from the cheese. Mmm, mmm, good!<br>-goat cheese with tomato sauce. It's super creamy and warm, and when placed on top of the garlic bread, it melts. <br><br>Some other menu items we thought were tasty (though not at the same 5+ star level as the above list):<br>-ham and cheese croquettes. They came four to an order and were jam packed with flavor. Although they look like mozzarella sticks, the cheese isn't melty, it's more cream-based. <br>-hanger steak. It was cooked medium rare and came with roasted potatoes and harissa sauce (which we all thought was similar to sofrito, but I'm not sure if it was the color or the flavor that led us to believe that!). <br>-octopus! It was many of our first times trying octopus, but it exceeded our expectations. Ever so slightly chewy, but great pop of flavor. <br><br>Tips:<br>-Check-in on Yelp and you get a free dessert. Surprisingly, because we all checked in, they let us all get a free dessert. It was NOT one per table. We tried four different ones and passed them around the table in true tapas fashion.

I've always sat towards the front of the restaurant and didn't pay that much attention...the tables are still small as heck though. Good thing that the servers are typically quick to pick up used plates because there's not a lot of room to place the various tapas that you will undoubtedly order. <br><br>As for the tapas itself, I can't think of a single one I've tried thus far that I didn't either like or love.

I don't even eat bacon, but I will if it's wrapped around those dates!<br><br>I went for weekend brunch and you get to order from both the brunch menu and the regular one. Highly appreciated. <br><br>Price is reasonable but keep in mind, because these are small plates, and depending on the size of your party, it may take you quite a few to get satiated. In other words, don't be surprised if your bill falls into the $30-40 range. The one cost-effective tip I'll give you: if you have a party of 2-3, split a sangria pitcher, instead of going glass by glass. I split a pitcher of red with another person and felt like I got a whole lot of sangria out of that thing...definitely my money's worth. <br><br>Ba-ba-reeba is consistent and I've yet to have an awful experience.

There are so many different rooms that all have their own atmosphere. My friend and I were seated in one of the back rooms, so it was quiet and made for a really pleasant and private dining experience.<br><br>Our waitress was really nice and attentive, and gave good recommendations. We ordered a half pitcher of the Classic Red sangria. It was delicious, and red wine is not usually my favorite. We really debated between the Classic Red and the seasonal special, which was white with mango. Next time.<br><br>This is definitely a menu you have to approach with a plan. Because we were only two people, we wanted to maximize our plates, so we ordered one plate from each category:<br><br>32. Goat cheese baked in tomato sauce.<br>42. Grilled squid with olive oil & garlic.<br>51. Short rib with mashed potatoes.<br>58. Meatballs with sherry tomato sauce.<br><br>They were all AMAZING. I wouldn't change what we ordered and I would order them again -- but first I would try everything else on the menu. I was seriously impressed.<br><br>The meatballs came out first and they were the perfect start. When we finished the meatballs, we dipped the table bread in the sauce -- YUM! The squid, short rib, and goat cheese came out pretty quickly after that.<br><br>The goat cheese was so fresh and creamy and the tomato sauce complemented the cheese very well. With the garlic bread that comes with the plate, these 3 make the perfect bite. Amazingly fresh and vibrant flavors.<br><br>The squid was wonderful. I'm not used to having grilled squid and it was so refreshing to actually taste the flavor of the squid and not fried breading. The sauce was really light and made this dish a great choice for something lighter, especially compared to the short rib.<br><br>The short rib was definitely the heaviest of the dishes and wasn't my favorite. The short rib had a great flavor but the mashed potatoes were kind of bland and eh (IMHO). The veggies that came with also weren't mind-blowing. I'd like to try the other meat choices.<br><br>We also got a free dessert for being first-timers (so I got to save my check-in dessert for later!!!). After the richness of the meal, I probably should've opted for a lighter dessert choice, but I couldn't resist the chocolate truffle cake. It was deeeeelicious. Definitely super rich and maybe not the best choice after such a rich meal, but it was amazing. I would for sure order this again.<br><br>Overall, an amazing dining experience.

We were able to be seated right away arriving around 5:30. We chose the chorizo-wrapped date and the laughing bird shrimp for a bite-sized pinxto ($2/ea.) Hubs enjoyed his date; my shrimp was good, but I wasn't prepared for the actual strip of chewy white fat adorning the top of the skewer, which I removed and didn't eat. When they said \"topped with fat\" I guess I assumed it was drizzled with a little grease or something; I personally don't eat solid pieces of fat like that. <br><br>We shared the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, which was really delicious ($8), and had a plate of soy-orange duck wings which were the special that evening and should go on the permanent menu, they were so tender and tasty. We attempted to order 1/2 a pitcher of the blood orange sangria (also a special for the evening) but apparently the server heard \"HAVE a pitcher of sangria,\" and brought us a full one, which we didn't figure out til we looked at the bill. I thought it was a little generous for a half, but didn't ask! Oh well. Guess someone's gonna have to drink all that extra sangria. Shucks! <br><br>We also ordered 2 portions (the minimum order) of the seafood paella with shrimp, scallops, and monkfish. I could only find a single piece of monkfish in the entire pan, but there were a more reasonable number of shrimp and scallops. The paella takes about 30 minutes to cook to order, so they ask you to be prepared that it will take a little longer than the tapas orders. Though we were stuffed by this point, my Yelp check-in earned us a free dessert tapa, so we chose the caramelized banana with vanilla ice cream and pistachios, the perfect sweet but not too heavy ending to our delicious meal. We ended up spending about $85 for the meal, which earned us 1 point per $1 for the Lettuce Entertain You group's frequent diner reward program - there are so many affiliated restaurants, it's a great program to enroll in!

Sausage fried paella rice with poached egg (off the brunch menu, everything else we ordered was from the dinner menu): This was good but not really a paella.

Seared sea scallops with leaks, torched oranges, and jamon serrano: Soooo yummy! This was the most expensive thing we ordered, but it was worth it!

Rioja braised short rib: Okay this was probably one of my favorite things. The meat was sooooo tender and just ugh tres magnifique! The sauce was good, the mashed potatoes were very buttery (maybe a little too buttery?) but meat and potatoes is just such a classic dish. It's hard to go wrong with something like that.<br><br>6.

Not only because of the flavors and presentation of the food, but also because we surprisingly didn't break the budget doing it, spending around $20 per person(I was fully expecting to spend twice as much). First thing to note is that this place is gigantic. It has like 5 different rooms, two semi-floors, walls of bread and bundles of ham swinging from the ceiling. They really do try to capture the dim but bustling atmosphere of a restaurant in Barcelona, and in my opinion they do so fairly successfully. Ordered 7 tapas between 3 people, including the warm potato and onion omelette, spicy potatoes with tomato aioli, beef empanada, chicken and ham croquetas, buttermilk-fried chicken thighs, seared Spanish sausages, and skewered chicken + chorizo sausage. All the dishes were good, though my personal favorites were the potato dishes, the croquets, and the skewered Spanish sausages. The beef empanada was also good though for a single $6 empanada I would probably wait for happy hour. Speaking of which, they have a solid happy hour here, where their dishes are priced as they were when they first opened 30 years ago, meaning you essentially get 50% off a lot of their favorites(patatas bravas, empanadas, roast dates, chicken & ham croquetas, pintxos, etc.) along with $16 pitchers of Sangria. It's every day from 4pm-6pm, along with Friday sand Saturdays from 10pm-midnight as well, and you can definitely get full off of $10-15 or so if you come by around this time. <br><br>All in all tapas are never cheap, though with the right orders, along with plenty of complimentary bread and olive oil, you can actually get fairly full without breaking the bank. We averaged around $12/person on just food, and with drinks it just brought it a little higher, which is not bad at all. Also, they knew it was our first time there, so they even brought us out a trio of desserts, on the house, which was a great way to end the meal and start off the night. For that and their happy hour, they are definitely warrant another half star(4.5/5)", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This is probably my favorite Spanish tapas restaurant.

But coming and asking too frequently whether we need anything else/ whether we're gonna order some more is a little uncomfortable. To me, experience is the second important thing (of course, the first thing is food) when I evaluate a restaurant but it was bad today. It felt like she wanted us to either order more or eat quickly and just leave. Yeah, more people started to come in for dinner but it wasn't that busy like last time when I came during the weekend. There were still empty tables. Also, when we got out receipt I wrote down my LettuceEats number on the receipt but it seemed like she didn't add it so I asked her and she said she'll add it later. I checked and it's not added.<br><br>The supposedly warm/hot tapas dishes we ordered were generally quite cold when it came out. Seems like it was sitting there for a while before it was served to us.  Also, I told my friend that grilled octopus tapas they have here is so soft but what we actually had today was hard to chew. Since I had a really great time last time, I was really disappointed. I felt sorry to my friends for recommending. Before today I always recommended this place when people asked me some good places to dine but I don't think I will anymore. Well, they might have a good experience like when I first came, but I'm afraid they'll have a bad experience like i had today so I don't want to take that risk.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-dNgBrv6kyqg-Z5v0DeTGw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Skewer.

It was 3 huge pieces of lettuce with 2 big pieces of tomato and then some green dressing. The cucumbers and onions in it looked old and dried out (9 dollars). The charcuterie was terrible. The only good thing we're the side cup of olives. The meats had funky flavors, the bruschetta was on hard stale bread and not appetizing. The cheese was not good and only came with 3 tiny thin slices. (20 dollars!!!). The chicken empanada only came with one, it was the better of the three. (6.50).

In a city where it can be hard to find a seat for brunch, they welcomed us with open arms at prime brunch time: no wait, yay!<br><br>This is a tapas place, so as long as you don't mind sharing you can choose a bunch of things and have a taste of each.

As two people with inquisitive appetites, we ordered bits of this and that and it was pretty uniformly great. <br><br>In (roughly) order of fave to least fave:<br><br>- Let me start by mentioning the bread at the beginning of the meal: crusty, toasted and served with butter and marmalade. Starting the meal with this assured good things in the future...but don't fill up too much because there's more to come!!<br><br>- Citrus French Toast with Goat cheese butter and honey. This was a wonderful amalgam of flavors: sweet citrus against the tang of the goat cheese, all smoothed over with a drizzle of honey. Delicious!!<br><br>- Bacon-wrapped dates. This is a tapas classic, and it's not hard to see why. These tiny morsels combine the best qualities of smoky and sweet.<br><br>- My dining partner got the mini Cubano, which he adored; I had a bit of the meat, but pork just isn't my favorite thing.<br><br>- Waffle-battered Chicken Stick. This is seemingly a chicken sausage stick; some sort of sausage at least was encased by the sweet batter. Sounded like it was going to be a version of chicken and waffles; ended up being more of a Spanish corn dog.<br><br>- The traditional Spanish rice dish paella was spicy with chorizo and studded with veggies. I avoided the poached egg, so he got to enjoy its combo of fluffy white and oozing yolk himself.<br><br>- Spinach and artichoke crepe. This was spinach-heavy but also filled with mushrooms and cheese. Yum.<br><br>- Bacon mac and cheese. Thin but delicious cheesy sauce, with strips of crisp bacon on top. Tasty though paled compared to other things.<br><br>- Surprisingly, the thing I liked least was a dish I usually love: shrimp and grits. Their spin used chorizo-flavored polenta in place of the grits (I should mention that this menu is loaded with chorizo in general, so if you don't care for sausage your options are somewhat limited.) The shrimp were what is described as \"Spanish baby ghost shrimp,\" which turned out to be half-inch-long minnow-looking things. The tiny pinpoint black eyes on each is clearly visible, which disturbed me somewhat. Tasted okay, but would not order again.<br><br>Daniel, our server, was friendly, explained things well, and checked up on us so we could order more.

This place is always solid!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I am a fan of tapas, and it being both Easter and my cousin's birthday, I thought it would be fun, so I decided on Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba for our family brunch. <br><br>We had a reservation and were seated promptly in the back room (where I worried that we may be neglected), but it was no problem. Our waiter and the bus boys were very attentive, and the pace was good. The only thing we had to ask for constantly was water, because the glasses were so small and a few people in our party were only having water. For larger parties where this is the case, leaving a pitcher of water on the table would be best. (Or at least larger glasses!)<br><br>My husband and my mom enjoyed the bloody mary bar ($10 for just one trip), while I tried the special sangria which was blood orange and just OK. ($8).<br><br>We enjoyed: the spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms (yummy!), brussel sprout salad (both crunchy and flavorful), beef tenderloin and blue cheese (a definite hit!!), chicken skewer, shrimp in olive oil and garlic, beef benedict, and the seared sea scallops. My daughter loved the chicken empanada, and I was the only one at the table who liked the potato and onion omelet. Of the above listed, the beef tenderloin was definitely a family favorite. We ordered two of those ($11 each), and they were cooked perfectly with the right amount of pink, juicy and tender. My husband is a former chef so he can be hard to please, but he was impressed by the presentation and the demi glazes and other sauces that accompanied the dishes. Most everything was flavorful and appealing to the pallet. <br><br>Missing the mark were the scallop empanada (the scallops were buried in all the bread, while the seared scallops were much better), and the grilled flank steak, which was tough. The fingerling potatoes that came with it were good, although that was $9 wasted for such a small, disappointing dish. My cousin also ordered the citrus cured salmon, and was disappointed because it was flattened and thin like paper. Thinner than even smoked salmon usually is, and I think he was expecting a filet, even if it was a tapas-sized one. Yet for our first try, this was not bad. <br><br>My husband ordered the veal special and while he was skeptical, it was very tender and cooked to perfection. Our only concern was that it was $17. That's pricey for a small tapas portion! <br><br>There was another group seated behind us, and one of the servers gave us their deviled egg by mistake. We ate it before we realized, and we actually would have ordered more if we weren't so overwhelmed by everything else that we had. It was good!<br><br>I liked the dessert menu and the fact that those are all $3 each. We got one free dessert for checking in on Yelp, and we ordered another one to sing Happy Birthday to my cousin. We ended up getting that one taken off the bill as well, which was nice. I wanted to try one of their coffees, but decided to wait until next time. <br><br>We thoroughly enjoyed our visit, and I'm only deducting one star for a few dishes and some of the priciness. Since it's all tapas, people are going to order a lot anyway, so prices for each item should be reasonable. Our bill was $190 before tip for 5 of us. Now that we know what we like, future trips can be planned a bit better. I see a date night with hubby in our future.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "After being in Barcelona, I was happy to check out all my favorite tapas here.

Dates wrapped in bacon and tomato sauce with goat cheese. Yes, I admit, both dishes are incredibly simple, but both are delicious and staples of tapas food. The dates and bacon are heavenly. The goat cheese and tomato sauce is fine, not the best, but i think it's just one of those you have to try.<br><br>Then I'll move onto some of the meat dishes. There are plenty and I've tried a great many, but I'll mention a couple. Specifically the rioja-braised short rib, skewered chicken and chorizo, and any of the squid. The skewered chicken and chorizo is especially good because that chorizo as absolutely top notch and it's only in a couple dishes.<br><br>This most recent time we also tried the Paella. Wow, definitely getting it again. Order it the moment you sit down because it'll take a while to come out, but man, it's absolutely superb.

If you are a sangria fan, you have to try it here! <br>We ordered six tapas and loved each and everyone. From the veggies and appetizer section we had the Brussel sprout salad and the spicy potatoes. I preferred the Brussel sprout salad because it was so finely chopped, lightly drizzled with oil and enhanced with sweet almonds. My partner preferred the spicy potatoes with the spicy tomato aioli. It was a perfect split for the two of us, but we enjoyed both! From the beef section we ordered the short rib and we ordered the fried calamari from the seafood section. The short rib was decadent, flavorful and heavenly tender. I could have eaten five of them, they were so good. The fried calamari were also good, but the mixture of the red Fresca salsa and cream sauce was the highlight of the dish! From the pork menu we ordered the assortment of cured pork meats and olives as well as the dates wrapped in bacon. The cured meats were a great starter and way to try some of the restaurants house cured meats. The dates, however, were my favorite dish. Paired with a sweet vinaigrette and apples, it was simply to die for!<br>We ended the evening with the $3 dessert a.) because they are only $3 and b.) because Yelp checkin provides a free dessert tapa! Perfect! We both got the chocolate truffle which was amazing! However, it was sooo sweet that I had to give half of it to my partner.

We were celebrating my son's birthday last Saturday and made reservations online thru Open Table. This restaurant gets SUPER busy, even at 5:30 pm, so be sure you make reservations. Parking is permit only in the neighborhood and there is no garage. CBR does have a valet service for $13. Totally worth it, Lincoln Park is super busy on the weekend and it's very hard to find street parking.<br>We began our evening with cocktails; they offer many flavors of Sangria. I usually order 1/2 a pitcher of red wine Sangrias. You get about 3 full glasses from 1/2 a pitcher. It's more economical than individual glasses. CBR also offers full pitchers. My sons ordered a margarita and a mojito. We discovered that many places offer a mojito but there is an art to actually making a good mojito, CBR fell short on this mojito. Not mixed correctly. Margarita was fine.<br>Tapas is a great way to try several dishes with your companions. Tapas are appetizer sized portions of Spanish dishes and arrive at your table in no special order. We usually start off with 2 per person, keep a menu handy and order more as the night progresses. We've been to CBR a few times and have tried pretty much everything on the menu and have been happy with taste, quality and quantity. If you order the paella, allow some extra time for it's preparation. <br>Our waiter, busboy and servers were very efficient, even thought the restaurant was packed!

The back is a little more crowded/but oddly romantic if you're looking for that atmosphere.<br><br>I find that when I go here it's the best when the table orders a pitcher of sangria to share (possibly more depending on the size).

And a dessert to split (despite the small portion) is actually quite perfect to tie it all together.

I've had their Blood Orange Special, and the Passion Fruit, but they don't compare to the White Peach.

Must have<br>-Goat Cheese baked in Tomato sauce (#32) great for group sharing but they give you bread anyways so I kind of pass this one unless someone else from my group orders<br><br>MEAT:<br>-Beef Skewer, horseradish (#54) DO NOT SHARE. You will regret it because it is so good you just want it for yourself. This is one of my favorite items!<br>-Shrimp with garlic, olive oil (#44)- Other favorite if you like seafood, this is good! Just make sure to flick off the red pepper flakes if you aren't into spicy!<br><br>DESSERTS:<br>-Caramelized Banana- Probably one of the most underrated options at the restaurant. THIS IS AMAZING. Probably could make it home but so worth $3. <br>-Butterscotch custard- small portion, but again just melts in your mouth and the perfect bites.<br><br>DISLIKE:<br><br>-The only menu item I haven't really enjoyed was the chicken & ham croquetas (#63)- unfortunately my experience was like a few sad soggy corndogs. <br>-The paella is alright, but honestly I don't find it all that exciting and definitely not worth how much it is.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Tapas Extrordionaire!!

Highly recommended: #44 (shrimp with garlic), #67 (bacon wrapped dates), seafood paella, and any flavor of sangria.<br><br>Intro<br>---<br>This has become my favorite restaurant in Chicago, and my 5-star rating isn't a case of severe fanboyism, but is a distinction well-earned through repeated visits. I've been to Spain and loved the food there, so I was very excited to try. The first time I went was with a couple friends, and I was very impressed with the quality of food, drinks, and service. It's not the most authentic Spanish cuisine, but the inspiration and heart is there.<br><br>Setting<br>---<br>Very warm and cozy. However, the restaurant is huge and there's so much activity going on around it can be loud and hectic. Added bonus: hanging Iberican hams for that authentic Spanish touch!<br><br>Service<br>---<br>Despite the craziness of all that's going on during a busy night, my table has never been neglected or forgotten. Food comes out in blazing fast times after ordering. The bussers are attentive in clearing your dishes and refilling your drinks. Everyone seems happy to serve you.<br><br>Food<br>---<br>There are so many different tapas, I will highlight the ones I've particularly enjoyed.<br><br>Roast dates with bacon & apple vinaigrette: Bacon wrapped dates has been overdone to oblivion but the apple vinaigrette is a nice complement that sets it apart. Second-best bacon wrapped dates I've had (sorry Ba-Ba-Reeba, but the honor of #1 goes to Avec!)<br><br>Seafood paella: Has a generous amount of shrimp, scallops, and monkfish. I despise green beans but I don't even care that they're in this dish, it's absolutely delicious. The rice has the perfect consistency.<br><br>Burrata with tomatoes, charred sweet corn, and avocado: A great marriage between all the different ingredients. The char on the corn brings an appreciated depth to the dish, and the cheese is very fresh. Vibrant and light!<br><br>Shrimp with garlic: They are unapologetic with the garlic. A blast of flavor will spread over your entire palette as you meditate on the texture of the perfectly cooked shrimp. Dip your bread in the leftover oil. It is liquid gold.<br><br>Caramelized banana: I can inhale ten orders of these if I wanted to. All desserts here are delicious but this one in particular is fantastic. Great toasty flavor from the caramel while never overpowering the banana. Texture contrast provided by pistachios. Temperature contrast provided by the ice cream. A delight to the senses.<br><br>Sangria: I hate sangria. I love Ba-Ba-Reeba's sangria. Five great permanent flavors with a rotating seasonal flavor. Do yourself a favor and get a pitcher... for yourself.<br><br>Other notes<br>---<br>What? They have a brunch you say? Admittedly I have not gone there for brunch service. I will have to make the effort to try it out. Check out their rewards program. Though Lettuce Entertain You does require money up front, you receive credit through your first several visits to make up for it.<br><br>Conclusion<br>---<br>I applaud the staff at Ba-Ba-Reeba, both front-of-house and back-of-house. It is a well-tuned machine that operates efficiently amidst all the chaos. Great service, great food, great memories. If you haven't tried Spanish food, Ba-Ba-Reeba is a great place to go.

We were seated at a table right next to the bathrooms and I constantly found myself drawing my chair back and forth to let people pass. The small plate (tapas) experience is indeed unique. Perhaps I'm just too used to the conventional style of dining (starter, main, dessert), but for me, I wasn't a fan of getting each small plate spaced out 5-10 minutes apart. Two tapas plates would show up, followed by a Pintxo (\"starter\") plate, then a 10-minute wait before another plate. Just seems oddly spaced out.

The dough was flaky and buttery and contained a generous amount of beef filling. However, the taste of the beef lacked seasoning. I would skip this one next time I go. <br><br>2. A seafood mixture which had shrimp and scallops: I don't remember what it was called but it almost looked like a ceviche. This was light, refreshing, and tasty. I did not feel guilty while consuming these calories. Yum. <br><br>3. Seared scallops: WOW! The highlight of the meal. Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, hint of garlic and a slightly sweet after taste. mouthgasm at its finest. <br><br>4. Stuffed mushrooms: My second favorite; however, a bit too greasy for being a veggie dish. <br><br>5. Chicken and spanish chorizo skewer: This was really, really, good too. They definitely know how to cook their meats. Me likey.<br><br>I must note that the food came out in \"chunks\", step by step, one by one. It was strange. It took about 5 minutes between each plate.

If you live near walking-distance or are above the law, try all three pitchers! You wont regret it (maybe later).<br><br>There are these pork ribs that are some of the best I've ever had! They satisfy all of rib criteria: crispy shell WITH a glaze + a true fall-off-the-bone texture. These really dont need any tooth effort for separation. Someone could pass gas in your general direction and the force of that small current of pleasant air could send the meat FLYING off these bad boys.<br><br>Spicy tomato aioli potatoes are a must at these places. Loved it. Again, crispy outside and soft center in that sauce.<br><br>Beef tenderloins w/ blue cheese + potato chips. I'm quite sensitive to blue cheese so I typically dont like ones that are super strong and overbearing. Here, they've got that balance between the cheese and the beef. Remarkably good!<br><br>Rioja-braised short ribs broke apart when introduced to the fork.

Hold on, WHAT! We decided to walk a block over to Café Ba-Ba-Reeba. What a blessing in disguise!! This place is awesome. <br>We obviously wanted to try some of the sangrias. Our waiter told us that we can order half pitchers, which was great because we just could not decide! We chose the sangria of the day, mango, and cevé I believe it was called, which was a sparkling sangria. Both were great, but I preferred the mango one, which we ordered a second pitcher of. <br>We ordered a WIDE array of foods, which they brought out as they were ready. We were also told if we wanted paella, it would take ~35 minutes to make, and you need to order at least two servings. Glad to know it is all prepared fresh!!<br>First up was the bacon wrapped dates (in some kind of apple glaze) and shaves Brussels sprout salad. The bacon wrapped dates were unreal! The apple glaze paired very well with it, and it wasn't too sweet. The Brussels sprout salad was also delicious. It was light. The dressing wasn't too much. And it had some kind of tangy cheese thrown into it, which I was a huge fan of. <br>Next out was some kind of steak with bleu cheese with chips and stuffed mushrooms. The chips were crisp and browned, just as I like them. The steak was cooked perfectly - the waiter said the chef usually cooks it medium, but we can choose how we like it cooked. We told him however the chef recommends, we will do that! The bleu cheese was a bit much, though, so both my friend and I scraped it off. The mushrooms were stuffed with spinach and cheese of some kind and topped with bread crumbs. They were cooked to perfection. Still had a little bite to them but the mixture inside- YUM!<br>Next up was a short rib of some kind with mashed potatoes and onion bulbs. The short rib melted in your MOUTH. I can't remember the taste of the sauce off the top of my head, but holy COW- it was delicious. The mashed potatoes were creamy and whipped. And the onion bulbs were soft but crisp at the edges. <br>The paella came out last of the food. It was warm and a flavor explosion. The rice was divine, and it had chicken pieces and green pepper in it. At this point I was pretty full, so I ate the chicken and green peppers out of it with some of the rice. I had a lot left over, but whatever! Still glad I ordered it. <br>I needed a wheelbarrow at this point, but we decided to indulge in a flourless chocolate cake dessert. It was the PERFECT size. Very small. But that sucker was DENSE. Very rich chocolate. It had the texture of fudge. And it came with some kind of whipped cream thing. Goodness. I couldn't help myself. I ate a few bites, although I was full. <br>My friend got an iced latte, and he said it was also good. <br>They were busy, and our server was pretty busy, as well. Usually, I don't like when servers don't check on you often, but honestly the type of intimate environment in there calls for slow service. It's a place that you go to relax, slowly eat, drink, chat, etc. When our server did stop by, he was friendly, helped answer any questions we had, etc. The only thing that I noticed was when we asked for recommendations, I felt like he pulled an answer out of his ass and didn't really give a genuine response.

Between four people, we ended up ordering nine tapas and also got two free desserts thanks to Yelp.

Of course, you can't go wrong serving a hunk of burrata, and the grilled octopus was tender and had a delicious char to the outside. The beef tenderloin with blue cheese was a bit of a strange request, but ended up being delicious. The blue cheese topping was a perfect salty complement a well-cooked and tender beef tenderloin. Personally, I am a huge sucker for bacon-wrapped dates and have to order them whenever I am out for tapas. There is something so special about crispy, salty bacon wrapped around a warm, gooey, and sweet yet slightly crisp on the outside date. Perfect combination and Ba-Ba-Reeba's dates certainly did not disappoint! I found tapas like the waffles with banana and nutella and the hangar steak to just be okay. Nothing really special or super flavorful going on. For dessert, we had a mango sorbet, which was good, and a flan with nitilla, which was also good, although it was fairly runny in the center.

I have to say, when I ordered the roasted peppers I  didn't expect to just get literally 8 little peppers, roasted. That's it. $6. Seriously. No sauce or even 1 other thing on the plate. That was a condiment, not a dish. The garlic potato salad was ok, but isn't that American grocery store stuff? I only ordered it because I ran out of choices. Didn't say \"Spain\" to me. The waiter said paella takes 45 minutes...so after the first round its too late for that. Wish i knew that...45 minutes!!! Really? So people wait 45 minutes for a meal here? I was starving still after about 5 shared dishes that were sooo small, so I ordered the omlet. Two of them. They were huge and it was toward the end of the meal...I didn't want an omlet for dinner, but after trying pretty much the whole veggie section, they were they same price as the meat items and there was not enough food. Why on earth would there be an omlet on the dinner menu? Chick pea stew was pretty good and a decent size. They need to get something with some substance on the veggie menu. And get rid of the omlet, it wasnt even very good. But at least it made me full. The good: spicy potatoes, the mushrooms and chick pea stew. The bad: roasted peppers, potato salad, omlet, brussel sprouts salad (no taste). The ugly: $50 each with tip and only getting full because of the omlet.

Just like in Spain!<br><br>This used to be my favourite restaurant--it reminded me of Spain. I even had my bachelor's party at the (doomed) Las Vegas outpost because I liked it so much, even after moving across the country. I've eaten here with my parents, friends, and colleagues over the past 25 years.<br><br>The last time I was here my daughter was 4 months old, this time she was 4.5 and I was able to take my son and husband (who has heard about the place for over a decade).  The original menu changed 11 years ago. Rice balls were added, the fantastic gazpacho and seafood ceviche, gone. Gabino's hand-laid brick patio has been gone awhile too, as are the terra cotta sangria pitchers and cheap goblets.  It's certainly more chic now, which I'm sure appeals to the local Trixies. <br><br>The vibe is different. It's not just because I'm old and there's progress, it's now, well, kind of blah & mainstream. The service remains top notch--fast refills, friendly, on it.  It's a well oiled machine that just works, but why were the kids given hummus & carrots? I'd expect chickpeas, but hummus? They loved the bread and oil, but hummus? In Madrid & Barcelona they weren't served hummus. I also question why the bacon wrapped dates were deliberately made soggy with the citrus vinaigrette--just put them on a plate. Stab an apple with the toothpick, if you like, but never, EVER make bacon soggy. That's just not fair to the pig.<br><br>The beef was perfect, as expected. The octopus tasted like fish sauce. I remember trying a Spanish restaurant in NYC which marinated its pork in fish sauce, and didn't get it then. I'm not offended by nuoc mam, but seriously, what is it doing in my Spanish meal? My 2 year old, however, loved the Vietnamese infused octopus, and ate most of it.<br><br>Sadly, my favourite dish was the lamb with mint sauce and ratatouille. Greek & French, but absolutely delicious. The shrimp skewers and mushroom bruschetta were also quite good. Toasted bread w/tomato caviar, cheese, and jamon were as expected. My husband loved the fried banana dessert & the kids loved the chocolate mousse. Sangria is still great.<br><br>I am, however, glad they haven't changed things so much as to serve tortilla chips.<br><br>My standards for Spanish restaurants remains high because I love Spain--it's where I stopped being a vegetarian because everything smelled so good that I just HAD to eat it. All of it. We spent a week there last year, will be returning this year. Sadly, I don't expect to return to Cafe Ba Ba Reeba on my next visit to Chicago. Maybe it was having the two managers stare and point at my table during what was supposed to be our relaxing final night in Chicago, or maybe it was the food, which is more pan-Mediterranean than Spanish. Hummus?  The servers, bussers, and rest of the staff remain friendly & efficient--you will not have to worry about not having your water glass refilled or having too much food served at the wrong time instead of in stages.

The fried peppers were surprisingly nice. They were a tray of a not super spicy pepper, I believe green jalapeños, fried, with most of the heat cooked out. There was however a big red pepper, which was still quite spicy. They are in some sort of a savory sauce with course salt.

My favorites include: sea food paella, it's fresh and the huge portion is easily sharable by 4-5 people. The market salad is delicious with the textures all playing well together. The spicy potatoes and goat cheese in tomato sauce actually pair well together, who doesn't like high-carb foods? I've also never been disappointed with the chef's specials, so be sure to hear them out.<br><br>- The classic sangria (red), is a hit or miss. Sometimes, it's superb, well balanced with plenty of fruit, but other times it's overly sweet and disappointing. If you'd like more fruit in your sangria, be sure to mention that, they'll usually bring you a side of pre-soaked apples to add to your glass. <br><br>- Definitely save room for dessert. All chocoholics must try the dark chocolate crema, the rich chocolate and orange contrast is simply too good to share. I'm not a fan of the chocolate truffle cake since the kahlua makes it a bit too sweet for my liking, but if you prefer milk chocolate I've heard it's a must eat. Finally, if the mango sorbet is in season, then definitely try it.

They are tender and I believe they use the same marinana sauce that the goat cheese comes with.<br><br>Lamb Kabobs - These are super flavorful! There are three in the dish and they have been grilled and marinated for deliciousness. They taste similar to indian kabobs but more tender and come in a tomato sauce!<br><br>Pincho de Pollo y Chorizo - My favorite Pincho de Pollo is at Cafe Iberico, but this one is delicious as well. It comes with a sauce that I wish i could make at home. The chicken is grilled, as well as the chorizo. It's pretty basic but really great!<br><br>Sangria - They always have a bunch of different types to choose from. I've never had a bad one, although I do wish they were a little stronger ;) You also can't go wrong with a bottle of wine!<br><br>Carmelized Banana with Ice Cream - This is always my favorite dessert!

After we got engaged and waited about a week, we already knew that CBBR would be it, we love the restaurant and the food and the tapas/family style plates and casual atmoshpere. Picking CBBR was just as easy as saying yes to him. Sure we had other places in mind (Carnivale, Tapas Valencia) but CBBR was more us. And it was important to us that we keep it personal, like we were just throwing a party. Traditional we are NOT. Plus, communication with CBBR was timely and friendly, which matters when you plan a wedding 6 months away.<br><br>From the moment I reached out to them about my possible party size (Was: 75, Actual: 125), to the day of - the communication and service was just wonderful in a word.<br><br>Alison and Ashley are some of my favorite people ever. My wedding day went off without a hitch because the entire staff is amazing. Literally amazing. We wanted to pay for everything before the wedding day because who wants to think about that when you're getting married. And it was so easy, and they ran our card for the final payment like we asked and let us know once they did. They think of everything before you do, which comes in handy if you're a frazzled, busy bride.<br><br>We wanted something low-key obviously, and we didn't even realize we picked St. Patty's weekend for our nuptials. So many other patrons stopped my husband and I for pictures and we can't even begin to explain how much fun our guests had. <br><br>So many guests commented on how this was \"the best wedding meal of their lives,\" which meant a lot to us because we obviously love to eat haha. <br><br>In fact, we got a wedding card yesterday from friends who added a PS in the card: \"We had so much fun at your wedding we forgot to put the card in the box!\"<br><br>That's all we wanted after all, to make sure our guests have a great time. Alison is so flexible and accommodating it was literally so easy to plan this with her behind the scenes. Also, she is so sweet in person (and in email but you know, email is your first point of contact!) We literally upgraded our bar package a week before the event and it wasn't even a big deal, they were both just like - SURE NO PROBLEM! In fact, my head count kept changing and I would just shoot her an email the week of and she would just thank me for me letting her know.<br><br>Ashley was there on the day of and always made a point to check in with me at every part of the day. She even brought me sangria refills too! So thoughtful. We actually dropped off our items the Friday before the wedding and they took care of everything, put programs at every place setting and literally (with the help of our friends/coordinators) gave us the day we dreamed of, better actually. <br><br>So sure, a restaurant wedding isn't for everyone. But this wedding was exactly us. My husband and I cannot wait til our one year anniversary. We're going to dinner at Cafe Babareeba and spending the weekend at the Four Seasons Chicago to re-live our wedding weekend just as it was. <br><br>Thank you so much Alison + Ashley for giving us the wedding day that was better than Rith and I could have ever imagined.

First thing that caught my eye on the menu was a little note stating that all charcuterie, cheese, olive oil, rice and spices are imported directly from Spain. Pretty neat!<br><br>A must order here is the Sangria. They have so many flavours, and the 8 of us shared 3 pitchers: White peach, Mango, and Passion Fruit. The Passion fruit was my favourite. Refreshing, fruity, and went well with all our food. So good for the summer!<br><br>Meatballs with sherry tomato sauce ($6) ---Forgettable. Nothing too special.<br><br>Roasted dates with bacon & apple vinaigrette ($6) ---Where to start with this plate. Okay, lets go with the one word : SPECTACULAR. I'm not particularly attracted to dates or bacon (I know I know, I'm a weird one), but this dish was an explosion of delicious. A good flavour balance from the honey sweetened dates, savory crisp bacon, and refreshing tart apples. My friend John quotes: \"Worth giving up your first-born child for. THEY ARE THAT GOOD.\" I'll let you decide how much of that statement is exaggeration and truth.<br> <br>Shrimp with garlic, olive oil, red pepper flakes ($8) --- If you like garlic, you will get a real kick out of this dish. Those thin garlic slices are extremely potent, but not overdone when added to the succulent shrimp. <br> <br>Spicy potato with tomato alioli ($6) ---Nothing overly special about these potatoes, but the spicy mayo does give it a little extra edge.<br><br>Serrano ham, salchichon, chorizo & manchego ($9)---A great plate of curred meats. I really liked that they weren't overly salty, which is a common characteristic of charcuterie I don't particularly enjoy. Cheese lovers will love the  manchego (a spanish goat milk cheese), so creamy!<br><br>Overall, a great experience!

We had a reservation on a Wednesday for 6 PM and we were seated immediately. The restaurant did not full up until around 7 PM, so it turns out that we did not need reservations. I have heard that weekends are a different story entirely, but my weekday experience was that it was not crazy busy. <br><br>We were seated toward the back next to a mirror (one whole wall of the restaurant is a mirror to give the illusion of a larger size). I noticed right away that there suble, classy Christmasy decorations that created a very inviting and cozy atmosphere. I could not stop smiling from the start to the end of my meal!<br><br>Our waiter was cordial and helpful in explaining the menu to us, as well as how tapas work, after we informed him that this was our first time dining at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba. We ordered the seafood paella for two for starters after our waiter informed us that would take the longest amount of time to be ready (30-40 minutes). We also ordered a glass of the classic red sangria to share. (Okay, mostly for my boyfriend. I don't really drink, so I just took a few sips of his because I had never tried sangria before.) I have nothing to compare it to exactly, but I thought it was delicious and certainly more enjoyable than red wine by itself (in my un-wine-cultured opinion). While waiting for our seafood paella, we did not hold back at all in ordering small plates of tapas. We kept ordering and ordering and the food just kept coming and coming!<br><br>My boyfriend had the roasted dates wrapped in bacon with apple vinaigrette and he said it was so good that I tried a tiny bite (I'm pescetarian). Sure enough, it was absolutely delicious. The flavors worked perfectly together. Next, we had the pintxos platter with the short-rib stuffed piquillo pepper, bacon-wrapped grilled shrimp, chorizo-wrapped medjool date and cheese, goat cheese croquette with lemon gastrique, roasted beet crostini with herbed goat cheese and hazelnuts, deviled egg with bacon and mustard. The goat cheese croquette was my absolute favorite with the shrimp in a close second. Next, I had the market greens salad, with chili-roasted corn, tomato, cucumber, avocado, goat cheese, and fresno chili vinaigrette; grilled squid on arugula with olive oil and garlic. It was fairly straightforward, but truly excellent. The salad was a great break from some of the other heavier tapas I ate tonight. We also ordered the spicy potatoes with tomato aioli, which were simply divine. I was skeptical when I first read the description on the menu, but boy, was I wowed! <br><br>By the time the seafood paella arrived after ~20 minutes, we were stuffed with tapas. I barely made a dent in my portion, which was pretty large. It's hard to say if it was because I was quite full or not, but I was not as impressed with the paella as I was with the tapas. The dish could have used a bit more flavor and the rice seemed a bit undercooked, which makes sense given it arrived at our table earlier than the waiter originally said it would. However, the calamari in the paella was of very high quality and I enjoyed it a lot!<br><br>After clearing our plates, our waiter brought us complimentary desserts because it was our first time at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, but I pretended it was because it was my birthday. There was no way I was going to turn down free desserts, even if I was very full from all of the abovementioned food. The coconut flan was the best. Simply The Best I Have Ever Had. I would make the trip back *just* for that flan. The other dessert was caramelized banana with vanilla ice cream, quince syrup, and toasted pistachios. The presentation was cute and it was quite delicious, though perhaps a bit too sweet with the quince syrup. <br><br>This was my first tapas experience, but now my expectations are quite high. My only real complaint, apart from not being blown away by the paella, was that the tables are pretty close together and it was easy to hear the entire conversation of the table right behind us. I should also mention that the portion sizes were pretty large. My boyfriend, who has had tapas before, observed that the portions were much larger than other tapas places he has eaten.

Great way to try more food for a lower price point.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "A few summers ago I was driving with one of my friends back then when we got a flat tire in Lincoln Park, in front of this Spanish restaurant. I had never changed a tire, so I was useless, my friend worked on changing it and a few passerbys helped.<br><br>Fast forward a few years to last night. I'm in the car with my best friend. We had made rum and Cokes with 7-11 slurpees, stopped at my piercer's shop to chat, had attempted to go to Peace Fest, and decided we should eat something. I'm particularly good at finding the best places to eat, and I usually refer to my Yelp app as a point of reference as far as what's near and what's good per the reviews. We're driving, I'm getting overwhelmed with what's near us at the moment (Lincoln Park area) and what's near our destination (Wrigleyville area), when Café Ba Ba Reeba pops up. I had read up on it, bookmarked it, and was determined to go one day. Over 900 reviews and I wanted Spanish, so off we went.<br><br>I had lived in Spain for six months, so I was so excited to see all the décor, complete with jamón hanging from the ceiling and FC Barcelona (Booo) scarves above the bar. We opted to sit outside. The patio was decorated with pretty lights and they even had traditional Spanish street signs on the wall (Calle de las lechugas AHAHA) Upon the standard checking-in to Facebook, Foursquare and Yelp, deals popped up. At the time, checking in on Facebook got you a free order of baked goat cheese, checking in on Yelp got a free pintxo platter. Such a good deal! We first wanted the baked goat cheese but then saw the pintxo platter and went for that. I was originally going to get only that, but I ordered the special Green City Market paella while my friend ordered a garlicky shrimp tapas. We rounded it out with a pitcher of white peach sangria.<br><br>I will say I was little put off by the waiter. He asked me if I had ever heard of pintxos, tapas and paella, I said yes, I lived in Spain for a while...and he still proceeded to explain what they were. Bro, I told you I lived there. I KNOW WHAT THEY ALL ARE.<br><br>Anyway, so I lived in southern Spain, went to Barcelona once, but never got to try the pintxos, so I was excited to try them here. Separately, they are $1.50 and during certain times, they are only $1...all together they are $8.95. On the platter:<br>Chorizo wrapped medjool date & manchego; ahi tuna poached in olive oil on avocado toast; goat cheese croquetta; short rib-stuffed piquillo pepper; artisanal Spanish cheese & quince; mushroom & rice croquetta<br><br>My favorites were the chorizo-wrapped date, the artisanal cheese and the mushroom and rice croquette.<br>My paella was depressingly tiny in comparison to the huge pans I had in Spain, but I wasn't too hungry so I guess it was okay. I also think the chef ran out of vegetables because I saw carrots in it when there weren't supposed to be...and it was missing green onions. My friend's shrimp was good, although she was disappointed in the portion size and lack of spiciness - hey, that's Spanish tapas and food in general.<br><br>My friend and I took an embarrassingly long time to finish our pitcher and the staff was nice enough to wait for us.<br>A great place!

The bacon wrapped dates had SUCH great flavor! All bacon-y from the first bite, but the finish was with the deep sweetness of the date. It's a great flavor combo. The jalapeno aioli was absolutely wonderful with the calamari. It had a nice heat to it, which I would expect! The beef medallions were succulent and had a little bit of bleu cheese on them, but not too much, so it wasn't overpowering. The potato chips were fine, but I'm not a plain potato chip person. The goat cheese came with some crostinis to spread it on and they were perfectly crisp without being too hard to bite into.<br><br>Our second round was: asparagus with manchego cheese, the mushroom, onion and arugula flatbread, and spicy roasted potatoes. The asparagus was perfectly cooked and had a great grilled flavor to it, especially on the tips. The flatbread was very tasty, but I felt it was missing something. Maybe a tiny sprinkling of lemon juice or a vinegar reduction. The spicy potatoes were just roasted potatoes with some kind of spicy mayo which wasn't spicy. I was disappointed with that one. When you say \"spicy\", I WANT SPICY. <br><br>Third round was dessert: caramel almond bar with a butter crust, and the butterscotch pot de creme. Heaven in my mouth. I had to take a few bites despite the fact that I am allergic to dairy, and it was worth the digestive counterattack. That butterscotch pot de creme was topped with a thin layer of a salted caramel sauce which complemented it perfectly. The best way to eat the caramel almond bar was to take a bit and chew it slowly while it melted in your mouth. Then all the flavors really popped out before you swallowed it.

Before you think \"Wow a food club. how impressive.\" It's not impressive at all. It's just a group of friends that want to eat, drink and try new places. Our 3rd official club meeting was this past weekend at Cafe Ba Ba Reeba. We made rezzy's for 10 but of course 3 people bailed within 15 minutes of the time we planned to leave. The restaurant was really nice and didn't get huffy when we explained that a few people bailed at the last minute. Our service was phenomenal from start to finish. One thing that I especially appreciated here versus where we went last weekend (Girl and the Goat) is that you can order your tapas 1 at a time, whereas G&G they make you order everything all at once. There is no rush to get you out the door here. In fact, we were there well over 2 hours and the waitress didn't seem bothered by it at all. <br><br>What we ordered:<br>-1/2 pitcher of Peach sangria. At $14, it was a steal. One glass of Sangria is $7 and I think I got at least 4-5 drinks out of the pitcher. Tasted phenomenal.<br>-Goat Cheese Croqueta Pintxo. A one-biter that was okay but I probably wouldn't order again.<br>-Deviled Egg with Bacon Pintxo. Why don't my deviled eggs taste that good? So fluffy and airy. I wish I could figure out the secret ingredient!<br>-Spicy potatoes with tomato aioli. Pretty good but they taste like fried potatoes that I make at home. The tomato aioli was good, but not sure if I would get these again. My friend had these before and said she remembered them being better -- maybe it was just an off night?<br>-Rioja braised short ribs w/ mashed potatoes. So yummy! The mashed potatoes tasted like white cheddar mashed potatoes and were the perfect compliment to the tender, juicy short ribs. <br>-Beef skewer and horseradish sauce. This was my favorite thing that WE ordered. The beef was extremely moist and the flavoring on the beef went perfect with the horseradish.  <br>-Serrano ham, salchichon, chorizo and manchengo. This was a cold plate of meat which we didn't realize when we ordered it. If we ordered it first, it would have been a great start, but we ordered it last so it was a let down.<br><br>What I tried but didn't order myself:<br>-Bacon wrapped dates- definitely my favorite of the night and a shame that I didn't trust the reviews and order them. Super tender and soft and one of those foods you could eat the entire plate and then order another.<br>-Fried calimari with jalapeno aioli. I've never had calimari with anything other than marinara so this was a pleasant surprise. It wasn't greasy at all but still very flavorful. Another dish that I wish I ordered.<br>-Roasted Chicken empanada. Pretty good and about what you can expect of an empanada, but compared to all of the other awesome dishes it wasn't brag worthy.<br>-Goat cheese baked in tomato sauce. This looked interesting when it came out and seeing the big ball of cheese in the center of some sauce made me apprehensive that it wasnt going to be special. It actually was very VERY good.<br><br>Dessert:<br><br>-Carmelized banana w/ toasted pistachios. Yummy! It was torched in the same manner as creme brulee so you got a nice crunchy topping along with the nuts.<br>-Butterscotch custard cream. Me and several others at the table enjoyed this the most. It's basically custard with homemade butterscotch on top.<br>-Churros with cinnamon and chocolate dipping sauces. I didn't order this but someone else at the table did. It was pretty good, but probably my least favorite out of all 3 desserts I tried.<br><br>I was overwhelmingly impressed by everything that I tried. Nothing I tasted was BAD and I tasted a good portion of the menu. Our bill for food, dessert, tax and tip was around $70 which included 2 desserts, 4 tapas, and 3 pintxos. Drinks were separate as we purchased those at the bar before dinner. <br><br>Only downfall of the whole experience is that the women's bathroom is TINY. Two girls were waiting in line before I entered and there really was no room for 3 girls to stand.

So we waited.... An hour and half later I go back up and ask how much longer to which they said \"We texted you it was ready quite a bit ago.\" To find out they texted the wrong number. They \"apologized\" and said they'd seat us next. We sat back down, right in front of the hostess table mind you and after 20 more minutes I asked again what the status was told yet again that they had texted me and hadn't heard from me. The lady repeated the number back to me and again they had it wrong (after 3 times of giving them numbers mind you).

It doesn't hurt that with sharing you get to try a bunch of stuff, too!<br><br>A meal at CBBR should begin with some sort of tasty beverage. Any of the sangrias are a great choice.

And some of the best tapas on the menu include the goat cheese in tomato sauce, citrus-cured salmon [YUM!!], braised lamb with couscous, and plato de casa.<br><br>But the fun doesn't stop there, kiddies! The pinxtos are definitely worth a shot at least once, especially if you get the platter for free by checking in on Yelp!! But if you're ordering singles, go for the ahi tuna or the short rib-stuffed poblano pepper.<br><br>And it keeps going and going...with paella. Order paella right away, as it takes quite some time to make. So decide quickly! I'd say that the seafood paella is my least favorite, and either of the other two are about even. Ask if they're serving specialty paellas that day, too. You might get a secret surprise!!<br><br>If by the end of your delicious meal you can manage it, go for the dulce de leche tres leches cake. A-MAZ-ING.<br><br>On the real, if you haven't already, download the Yelp app for your iPhone/Android device. Checking into CBBR twice [I believe] will get you a free pinxto platter.

Good variety to choose from.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "$25 gift certificate + desperately clinging to the last days of summer = an evening at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba. <br><br>Cleaning off my coffee table for the first time in months (that's what watching a marathon of \"Hoarders\" will do to you), I came across a gift certificate that was earned by attending the New Years Day Pajama Brunch at Ba-Ba-Reeba. Since it was expiring in November, I figured it was time to get off my duff and use it, and since I don't love sitting inside here and it was warm last night, my s.o and I made our way there to enjoy some tapas and sangria on their outdoor patio. <br><br>He hadn't been there in years, and I hadn't been there since New Years, and to be honest, neither of us would have gone here if not for the weather and the lure of saving $25. <br><br>To my surprise, this place still packs 'em in, despite tapas being rather passé. This was one of the first (if not the first) tapas places in the city (not sure if Café Iberico holds that distinction) and it's still going strong, so people obviously still go crazy for tapas. I can take 'em or leave 'em. <br><br>We were lucky enough to snag one of the last remaining tables outside since we didn't have a reservation (which never occurred to me that I'd need) and our jovial server greeted us and we ordered a pitcher of red sangria while we decided what to order. <br><br>Our server brought out our pitcher and asked us if we were on any time constraints so he could guide us accordingly and time our food. I thought that was a really nice touch and wonder why more servers aren't proactive. We actually had all the time in the world but we appreciated being asked nonetheless. <br><br>The sangria, as always, is consistently good and refreshing. Appropriately sweet (but not cloying) and fruity, it went down faster than a $5 hooker. <br><br>We selected a few tapas to get things going: ahi tuna poached in olive oil on avocado toast, baked goat cheese, and grilled calamari. <br><br>The tuna arrived first, and instead of tuna it was covered with chopped cauliflower. We both dug around and could find no tuna. The server came over and we showed it to him and he apologized and took it away to be remade. Once it came back correctly, it was very good. In fact, the server brought us an extra order of it, which was nice. I loved the smear of avocado on the crusty bread. <br><br>The goat cheese is exactly the same as every other tapas restaurant on the planet; nothing mind-blowing, but satisfying just the same. <br><br>I didn't really care for the calamari as it was rubbery and chewy and didn't have enough \"char\" for my liking for being grilled. <br><br>We were still hungry so we ordered a mushroom empanada and the sirloin with shiitakes, asparagus and potatoes. The empanada was huge for a tapas, but the crust was flaky and the filling was earthy and had notes of sherry; it was delicious. The sirloin didn't have much flavor, and it was cooked as ordered, but it was a tough cut of meat, so I'm not convinced it was sirloin. The accompanying vegetables were fine; the asparagus was a bit woody and tough, but the mushrooms and potatoes were decent, as was the sauce. <br><br>By then we were appropriately full, so we declined dessert and lazily sat and finished our sangria, lamenting the end of summer. <br><br>All in all, Ba-Ba-Reeba is a perfectly respectable place to dine if you enjoy tapas.

Since the bar is near the exit of the kitchen, separated from the main dining area, service was extremely slow.

She provided no apology and didn't know what to do with our mushrooms that we had already cut into. She stared at the plate of mushrooms like they were alive and said, \"Ohmigod, that's so weird!\" It's not weird, Honey; we ordered it 1/2 hour ago and it's been sitting up at the pass waiting for someone to bring it to us. Hot food eventually gets cold.<br><br>The food runners were rude, just dropping plates off and disappearing, leaving dirty dishes on the table and unable or unwilling to answer simple questions \"Which tapas is this?\" and \"Can you please tell me where the rest room is located?\"<br><br>The tapas themselves (when they were temperature appropriate) were good (that's why they are getting 2 stars and not 1) but not spectacular. The other reason for the 2nd star was that they had their menu sectioned off by type of meat (fish, pork, vegetable/cheese, etc) and THAT is a good idea.  However, it would have helped if we knew what was supposed to be cold and what was supposed to be hot.<br><br>The waitperson acted like their olive tapenade was some exotic dish just brought to Lincoln Park last week from far off lands (\"Have you ever had this before?\" the waitress says, Yes, Sweetheart, Trader Joes has the exact same thing except twice as much for half the price). She couldn't even tell us what olives were used in the making of it...yes, usually it's Kalamata but she acted like it was \"ohmigod so weird\" that I started thinking maybe it was some olive I've never heard of.<br><br>The food, in general was overpriced and super small portions, even for tapas.  Again, you get more for your money and less attitude at any of the three tapas restaurants I first mentioned above.

Our server gave us her honest opinion with our questions and her dining suggestions were spot on--we really enjoyed our whole experience. We started with a 1/2 pitcher of sangria--which was just enough for the two of us. Fruity and refreshing with lots of bits of fruit throughout. I didn't need more ice, but I noticed there was one server that all he did was add ice to sangria glasses for the folks that wanted/needed more ice. <br><br>We shared the Pinxto platter, the mixed greens with beets, oranges & goat cheese, the grilled sirloin with asparagus, shitakes & potato, and the grilled squid in olive oil. <br><br>My highlights: <br>The short rib-stuffed piquillo pepper (on the Pinxto platter) had a nice smoky flavor balanced by the mild pepper flavor. I also liked the Spanish cheese and quince (also on the Pinxto platter) just a very simple flavor of semi soft cheese and sweet quince. The salad was also very fresh and so light--I could have eaten the whole plate of salad by myself. The squid was very fresh and tasty--not at all rubbery, but I wished it was a bit hotter. By the time it arrived at the table it was lukewarm. The grilled sirloin was cooked to medium and delicious. The asparagus that came out was more like asparagus tips and there were definitely more potatoes than asparagus and shitake put together. <br><br>I also now have a new favorite summer beer--Estrella Damm--which the Hubs swears I can find at Binny's. (hope so!) and can you guess--yes, it's very refreshing and light. Perfect with tapas! <br><br>For dessert I had the coconut flan--I loved how all the deserts are small servings too!

Unfortunately, no one can, so the wait here is ludicrous or you just shouldn't try. I went to Babareeba last Friday with a group of seven. We weren't able to arrange for reservations ahead of time, and decided to put our names in. My friend first put our name in at 7:15Pm. We weren't seated until after 9Pm. With reservations, the wait isn't usually this long...I'm just giving fair warning.<br><br>The sangria is a must. I love all the different types that they offer. Passion fruit is probably my favorite, but the regular red and white are very tasty staples. Our table ordered a bunch of plates to share. The complimentary bread is also far better than average. <br><br>Normally, I list my favorite dishes and the dishes that miss, but I would be listing the whole menu under the heading \"delicious.\" The best approach is to come with a group of four to six people and try everything. Make sure to order the wood-roasted sweet potato bravas, rioja-braised short ribs, and the beef skewer with horseradish cream & red onions. Other favorites include any of the croquetas, the meatballs, and the spicy potato bravas. I'm not a huge fan of artichoke dip and the goat cheese spreads in general, so I would skip that but I know the rest of the table loved them. <br><br>The paella is good, but I don't think that it is necessary for a delicious and filling meal.<br><br>This past trip was the first time that I had sampled the desserts thanks to a free gift with yelp check in. Thanks yelp! We all LOVED the dessert. DO NOT MISS THIS! The desserts are small bites, so you can find room after stuffing yourself with the tapas.  I didn't think that a caramelized banana could be improved upon, but Babareeba's banana dessert is fantastic. The hard sugary topping is a nice touch. The Butterscotch pudding was definately worth a taste, but it is very rich. Everyone loved the Chocolate truffle, no one needed more than a bite....it was that satisfying and dense.<br><br>I don't love the layout of this place, but I understand the need to cram in tables wherever they fit, especially since big groups and birthdays love this place. There are so many rooms and corridors that you can get lost going to the bathroom. While I love being seated on the recently renovated patio, I'm less of a fan of being seated I the basement. <br><br>The BEST part of Babareeba was the bill. For a table of seven that ordered two pitchers of sangria and three rounds of tapas, our Subtotal was $19 per person!!!! One of our part even had a $10 off coupon.  Its definitely worth the wait to be promised such a fun, festive, and filling evening.

I highly suggest this as an option if you do not have a reservation.<br><br>Order a pitcher of Sangria. The traditional Red is a good option.

The tapas here are affordable, but be aware that if you order Wine/Sangria, you're bill will reflect accordingly. Be Warned.<br><br>If you check in on foursquare, you get a free pintxos platter. A $9 value, pretty awesome deal. 6 bite size tapas for free! The goat cheese croqueta was one of my favorites. It was oozing and delicious. The mushroom and rice croqueta was also very good. The short rib stuffed piquillo pepper was too spicy for me, skip it. <br><br>Let's face it, one reason people use Yelp is to see what to order. Here's some tips:<br><br>#44 Shrimp with garlic, olive oil, red pepper flakes - Like a Spanish style shrimp scampi. Really delicious, a little kick of spiciness. Save the plate, the olive oil and garlic is delicious to sop up with your bread. <br><br>#50 Beef tenderloin & blue cheese - So damn good. I wish I could have an entire steak of this, but unfortunately it comes with 2 small medallions. Perfectly cooked, it'll make your knees buckle. Must order. It comes with potato chips (homemade?) which are good to munch on but nothing to write home about. Not ideal for big groups, however, because of the small serving size. <br><br>#53 Handmade Beef Empanada - Flaky crust with a beef filling. This was ok, but a single empanada for $6?? I've had way better empanadas from Lito's for $2.59 apiece. I went out on a limb and got this and won't be ordering this again. <br><br>#68 Roast dates with bacon & apple vinaigrette - Best bacon wrapped dates EVER. Been recreated many times, but none better than these. For $5, sweet Jesus this could be my form of crack at that price. So good. <br><br>#30 Spicy potatoes with tomato alioli - Glorified potato wedges? I had high expectations, a lot of rave reviews for these but I didn't think they were too special. Not spicy and were pretty much something I'd get from a breakfast diner. Plus, very filling. <br><br>#32 Goat cheese baked in tomato sauce - I read a previous review from Jen B. that called this dish what it really is... deconstructed pizza. Very good for sharing with friends, but this is pretty much just a cheese spread with marinara sauce. I will say though, that this would be one damn good pizza.  <br><br>The food came crazy fast. Additionally, if you fill out cards to join the Lettuce Entertain You email list, you get a free tapa. We each filled out a card and the server said he'd take off 2 tapas from our bill.

For the second tapa we had the chicken and chorizo skewer, the flank steak, and the garlic shrimp. The steak was very tender and had a great sauce and the chicken and chorizo were great! Even though the chorizo wasn't spicy, it still had a great flavor. However, the garlic shrimp was fantastic; definitely a favorite of that course. The garlic taste wasn't overpowering, and they were seasoned perfectly! For dessert, our waiter informed us that we could order any dessert, not just the ones off the dessert restaurant week menu. We ordered the caramel marcona almond bar, the carmelized banana with quince syrup and vanilla ice cream, and the apple empanada. The desserts came small and just perfect as to not be overly-filling.

To start, we ordered the bacon wrapped dates (my fave!) and a bread with tomato, parm, and arugula. It was so good!<br><br>Then, we ordered the meatballs, which were delish. You could taste a hint of green pepper in the sauce. Just wonderful. We then ordered a roasted veggie spread with bread. The bread was warm!<br><br>We also had the chicken skewers with pesto and grilled zucchini. The chicken was just okay.<br><br>Then, we ordered 2 servings of chicken and pork paella! i absolutely love their paella. It comes with artichokes and green peppers. If you have never had saffron before, the taste might be something you have to acquire.<br><br>For dessert, we ordered the coconut flan, almond and caramel bar, and caramelized bananas. They were all wonderful and only 3 bucks each!<br><br>All of this food was for 3 people and it cost 93 bucks.

Spain also has the Mediterranean Sea and its incredibly fresh seafood to draw on...we in Chicago are not quite so fortunate. All of this is a long way of saying that I'm usually satisfied at best with American renditions of tapas. While its impossible to recreate the history, culture, and (dare I say) magic of tapas in Basque country, Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba does a more than passable translation right in the heart of Lincoln Park.<br><br>I realize that this place is a bit of a scene, and while I'd normally opine more fully on the decor and service, I'm going to focus on food in this review which is the basis for the 4 stars I'm giving. Suffice it to say the service was efficient and the atmosphere lively, even on a Sunday evening. Here's what we tried:<br><br>1. Chorizo-wrapped mejdool date & cheese: With good ingredients (which these were), this one is hard to mess up. Almost sweet & rich enough to have for desert, however, so consider saving for later in the meal even though this will likely be one of the first dishes out of the kitchen.<br><br>2. short rib-stuffed piquillo pepper: an absolute knockout. Get more than 1.<br><br>3. goat cheese, pistachio, mint and nispera preserves: sounded better than it was, which basically amounted to a goat cheese spread (could barely detect the mint or pistachio) with a very sweet fruit preserve on top. Wouldn't order again.<br><br>4. salmon, celery root puree, kale chips & sea salt: not exactly your traditional tapas dish (last I checked, no salmon swimming around the Mediterranean), but delicious nevertheless. Salmon was perfectly cooked & seasoned, celery root puree was flavor & texture-wise spot on. Kale chips, though crispy and delicious, were not quite enough to add a textural contrast to the dish. Only a minor complaint, would definitely order again.<br><br>5. octopus a la plancha, fingerling potatoes & olives: this is exactly the type of dish you'd expect to see as a hot tapas item in Spain, and CBBR executed this one perfectly.<br><br>6. serrano ham, salchichon, chorizo & manchego: good but not great, and I say this mainly in comparison to the real deal (versus any other Chicago charcuterie, this dish totally stands up).<br><br>Also had a pitcher of the traditional red wine sangria which was a bit sweet (read: not boozy enough) for my taste.<br><br>All of this for $60 pre-tip and I felt like I had gotten away with at least a light misdemeanor. Dinner was last night and I'm ready to go back today. Hat's off Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "All of the food we tried was delicious!!

The first time I went, we waited a very long time after being seated even to be greeted and have our drink orders taken. By this time we were ready to order everything already. We did have to grab a different server at one point because we didn't see ours much at all. It was not too busy at this time, either. The second time was early, around 10am when they opened. The service was prompt, but we had a different issue. I understand when the restaurant first opens there are not many tables to attend so the servers stand around, but we felt down-right uncomfortable eating because we were being watched by different servers who were not busy. It was hard to relax and enjoy the food when we could see them just standing there watching us. Quite uncomfortable. This is more a note to the business, just something to keep in mind.

My boyfriend and I went on a Wednesday night around 9:00 and it was still a 20 minute wait. However, the hostess invited us to take a seat at the bar if we were able to find a seat, and there were plenty of open ones so we decided to just do that. I actually really enjoyed sitting at the bar--we were able to ask the bartender his opinion on a few things, and he was really helpful. We started with the Pintxos platter of small bites and EVERYTHING was delicious, especially the grilled shrimp and the goat cheese croqueta. Then we ordered a first round of tapas and again, everything was delicious.  If you aren't familiar with what is on the menu, I would go for the red-font items--those are their specialties and you can pretty much count on it being a home run. We started off with the shrimp with garlic and olive oil (delish), the chicken and ham croquetas (delish), the beef tenderloin and blue cheese (delish), and the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce (SUPER delis). Like I said, it was just me and my boyfriend, but neither one of us had eaten much that day so we were still hungry and decided to order a couple more. We added on the meatballs with sherry tomato sauce and skewered chicken and chorizo and that was perfect.

I honestly felt like my friends and I were not paid full attention to because of our age. We are not of drinking age, and I think we were discriminated against because of this. Our waiter, although friendly at first, was not attentive, nor did he provide adequate information on general tapas knowledge, despite us telling him it was our first tapas experience.
