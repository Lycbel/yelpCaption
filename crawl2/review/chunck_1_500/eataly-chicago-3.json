They have amazing fresh pastas, charcuterie plates, and wines. As far as atmosphere goes this place is spot on, and the food is good it's just a tad overpriced for what you get (hence my 4 stars). Service is never that great either and with their high price point I'm definitely looking for a higher standard of service. Last time our waitress didn't know any of the new menu for the winter pop up shop, but good thing my foodie friend and I were able to make some excellent choices. Whatever you do, please try the butternut squash gnocchi it is life changing. <br><br>As far as the grocery portion of the establishment they have a lot of great items but they are VERY overpriced.

From the name I presumed it was an Italian restaurant, nothing more. Yeah...about that...boy was I wrong! I'm not really sure what to call this place. Eataly is a hybrid between a Specialty Grocery Store and a set of communal restaurants. If you want something Italian, come here!

Such an interesting place...stacked to the brim with...what else Italian goods; from Wine to Cheese, Crackers & Breads to Sweets, Olives, Oils, Condiments etc...you get the picture...It's all Italian...and you can also EAT here. Nice Ambiance, clean, well lit and an immense selection. <br><br>I briefly looked up all the pics on Yelp before I came and saw some amazing food. However, when I got here I was a bit disappointed...mainly due to ignorance. I was confused and did not know where all the Pizza, Pasta, Oysters, Seafood, Sandwiches and Meats were coming from...I'll explain: As soon as you enter the store, there is a dining area to the immediate right along with a cafe and on the opposite side a Gelato and dessert station as well. I didn't see any Pizza down here and the menu was fairly limited...so I was a bit befuddled. I went to the dining area and ordered some food: <br><br>~ Daily Special - MALTAGLIATI al RAGU de MAIALE - 4/5<br>Poorly Handcut Pasta Squares braises catalpa grove lamb, peas Pecorano Romano dip. Doesn't look like a lot, but its pretty hearty and filling. Tasty, hearty and flavorful, but not amazing.  <br><br>~ Grand Gelato with 3 Flavors - 4/5<br>Some dessert to finish up a meal. Good stuff, not too sweet or creamy, but once again not astounding.<br><br>~ Canolis - 5/5<br>Now these were AMAZING! I got one of every flavor! To go...of course! Pretty much what I envision a perfect Canoli to be...Perfectly balanced Creamy, Sugary deliciousness without being overly sweet or too heavy.<br><br>After gorging on my early diner I decided to go upstairs...NOOO!!! Da Fuk?! Why did I not come up here earlier?! The rest of the foods are available upstairs! Sandwiches, Pizza, more pasta etc... It's true! It's all here!! Doh!!!

That's what Eataly was to me. <br><br>Before realizing there was an upstairs, I walked around downstairs then found a gelato and rosé stand. These people must know my heart. I ordered a waffle cone (best waffle cone I've had. Maybe they bake them fresh everyday. So good) with a vanilla scoop and lemon scoop.

Last week, I bought them several housewares presents (including the cute pink thermoses on the top shelf)... and cans and cans of Lavazza Italian coffee for me because they were having a half-price sale. One advantage of buying presents here is that Eataly wraps them for free, while you wait, in the customer service area near housewares.<br><br>I agree with many of the comments that the waits can be too long, as this has become a tourist magnet.

Okay maybe not all, but there were so many with such cool ingredients and things I've never heard of, it was so intriguing! I ended up buying two boxes of organic fruity teas for around $4 something each with 30+ bags. I also got a double shot of espresso and a handful of Italian chocolates from the variety bar to the right downstairs, sampling frosé slushies on my way out. The espresso was magnificently decadent and I recommend it over any I had in town (except maybe Fairgrounds).<br><br>On my second visit I came for homemade raviolis but found out it was $14 for about 10 little squares so I went with a house made cookies and cream cannoli and limoncello style slushie instead. Honestly, best decision I've ever made. The drink was packed with fresh lemon flavors you can only find out of the country and the cannoli tasted of thick, flavorful ricotta that was far from too sweet and the perfect combination of filling and satisfying. I would eat one of those every day if I could and I'm not typically a huge cannoli person. <br><br>Downstairs left side is mainly coffees, teas, snacks, and kitchen goods.

Everything was so fresh and delicious, omg! I definitely enjoyed the cavatelli the most, compared to the pizza. The braised pork was sooo flavorful and the textures of everything was just right. The server was so kind and friendly too. Their ingredients were from local farms and they even quote it in the menu, and after tasting their food and seeing the workers make the pasta, I believe it. <br><br>After eating at Osteria di Eataly, my bf and I walked around and bought some wine and even walked over to the deli guy and had him pair some fresh prosciutto di Parma and cheese for us, and it was simply delicious! <br><br>I wish there was an Eataly closer to me, but they are currently in NYC, LA and Chicago.

If you're in the market to shop for some Italian speciality items, you've hit the jackpot here. Part market, part restaurant, plus add in a bakery and microbrewery and you've got Eataly.<br><br>The experience is a bit overwhelming because there's so much to see, eat, and drink. It can get crowded on the weekends. I was there on a Sunday night though and while it was pretty busy, it wasn't uncomfortable at about 5:30 pm.<br><br>After browsing both levels of food, my husband and I posted up inside the microbrewery, Birreria, which was on the second floor. Neither of us were really in the mood for beer, but we wanted a bite to eat and they had tons of open seating (all the other eateries were pretty full). <br><br>Out waiter was nice and eager to take our order, but once he did he kind of disappeared. He also wasn't very good at clearing our dishes as our table got pretty full. Nice guy though. My husband had a local beer (I forget which one) and I enjoyed a sparkling water. I was kind of shocked that they didn't have more Italian beers available. We were given bread and oil, but not offered any pepper or Parmesan which was weird, because I saw other tables with it. The bread was alright, and same thing with the oil. To snack on we ordered the suppli arancini which was filled with Parmigiano Reggiano risotto and cacio di roma. They were flavorful and came with plenty for two people, but honestly not the best arancini I've had. I could have done without the cheese dusting on the outside. It was too much in my opinion.<br><br>After we ate and cashed out at Birreria we went on our merry way to find some dessert. I remembered there was a gelato bar downstairs so we popped into there. I got the chocolate gelato with fresh berries on top. The gelato was heavenly and the berries were a nice touch. Although \"fresh berries\" should have just been labeled as raspberries because that's what I was given. Service at this counter was extremely slow and truthfully, lacked personality. Luckily, I forgot all about my mediocre (at best) ordering experience once that amazing gelato hit my lips! My husband ordered affogatti which was a first for him. He said it was good, but not what he expected.<br><br>Long story short... Eataly is a must visit at least once! Sure, it's a tad overpriced but you can find some great Italian items that you can't get elsewhere. Service could be better, but it might depend what vendors you visit. If you're there during peak hours be prepared for a crowd, but if you're like me, people watching is always a good time too. I'd definitely like to come back when we can grab a seat at one of the eateries to enjoy some wine and cheese!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "We just happened upon this place was we were out walking during out weekend in Chicago.  It is a store as well as several different places to eat on the second floor.  All the pasta is made fresh to serve and you can see them making it as well.<br><br>We had lunch here for five and it was an absolutely amazing meal.  Each of us had something different and we were all sharing off each other's plates.  We opted for the area of the restaurant that focused on fresh pasta.  All I can say is that I will be stopping here to eat anytime that I find myself in Chicago.  <br><br>Food and service were amazing.  We were asked about food allergies and the chef was more than accommodating for someone with a dairy issue.<br><br>We of course bought imported cookies from Italy on our way out through the store.  I truly enjoyed this place!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This place is really an experience.

Think about the sheer number of Instagram photo ops!)<br><br>Chicago's Eataly is sprawling, as the largest branch in the US when it opened in 2013.

The wide variety of options made it difficult to decide, though on the flip side you can't go wrong. We tried the new special, the Bresaola, which is an aged, air-dried salted beef. It tasted in between salami, prosciutto, and roast beef, a little salty sweet, a little aromatic, and quite hearty for thinly sliced charcuterie. With a thick smear of herbed cream cheese on top of a large slice of fresh focaccia and a layer of olive oil in between, it was essentially an open-faced sandwich that turned out surprisingly filling. Although $8.20 seems expensive for a piece of bread, it's reasonable considering it was arguably the best focaccia I've ever had, and it fed 2 people for lunch. <br><br>We also checked out Caffé Vergnano 1882, purportedly authentic Italian espresso since 1882. I must say, the cappuccino is not your typical cappuccino--they have different roasts of espresso, each with its own character, and the consistency is luscious velvet (not to mention photogenic latte art is on point). <br><br>Browsing through the aisles, the items that they sell are pricey but are really quite unique, and the packaging is unique enough to make good gifts. Overall, I think the quality justifies prices but you have to be a little wary so you don't go complete broke over European snacks. <br><br>The verdict?

This place was so great, that we decided to stop by twice over our holiday weekend! <br><br>Ok, so what is Eataly? It's a large Italian marketplace that has several restaurants, cafes, and retail items. They had various restaurants to choose from (i.e. pizza, sausages & cheesees, seafood, bakery, pasta) all under one roof. The restaurants and cafes were PACKED, but not difficult to get into. For our first night, we enjoyed a couple of dishes of pasta: squid ink pasta with seafood in a light sauce and a pappardelle pasta in a braised short rib ragu sauce.We watched at the bar as the chef cut up the fresh noodles in front of us and threw all the ingredients in a pan. You couldn't get more fresh than this! Seafood was fresh and pasta was cooked beautifully!<br><br>For our second visit, we opted for some fresh focaccia. My husband ordered sweet peppers and sausage while I had mushrooms and parmesan. The focaccia itself was savory with crispy edges and a soft interior. We loved them so much that we decided to order 2 more for the following trip home. This time, we opted for something a little sweeter. For the husband, chocolate chips and for myself, blueberry. Both were dusted with some sugar on top which definitely satisfied my sweet tooth for the day.<br><br>Retail items are a little expensive. You can find many of their kitchen gadgets elsewhere for a fraction of the cost. <br><br>This place can get a little overwhelming at first, so I recommend that you take your time and walk through both floors thoroughly so you don't miss a beat! Trust me, your eyes and mouth will thank you later. Worst case scenario, if you get too flustered, head to the main floor and buy a scoop of gelato to melt your frustrations away. ;]", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Very fun to come in and take a look at all of the specialty imported items from Italy.   <br><br>This place is like a designer grocery store with food options.   The cheese selection is out of control!  I wanted to eat the entire place. <br><br>It is overpriced but again this is kind of a touristy/yuppie place so I wouldn't expect any less. <br><br>We bought a few items from upstairs but we didn't eat up there.   We ate downstairs at the dessert bar.   The desserts were pretty tasty  (again overpriced) but the service was a little lackluster.   I will say we were here after 10pm so I wasn't too surprised by this. <br><br>Come in check it out.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jlJ0xFqoH5iHks6bfymcnw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Items bought from upstairs"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "I can't seem to avoid a trip to Eataly each time I'm in Chicago. The selection of cheeses is unlike any I've experienced (except I guess the Eataly in New York), the pastas are sensory overload.

The seafood, the meats, the gelato, the chocolates, the cookies... groceries, sundries, wines and eateries.

The wines, beer and liquors are together at the top of the escalator, etc. Don't expect to get to it all on your first visit, especially if it is a weekend.

The charcuterie tray and dozen oysters that we ordered for 3 of us was plenty for a mid-afternoon snack. Oysters were fresh, flavorful cold water ones.

You walk in and you see grocery items to the left and some resturants to the right. It starts with a coffee/expresso/etc area on the right. And across the building is a dessert area. I am been to the coffee and they beat starbucks anyday. As much as I hate to love Starbucks, this is the real deal. It is not super sweet like them so its a nice finish to your meal upstairs. <br><br>If you see some overpriced kitchen utensils or kitchen equipment, this is your area otherwise you must go upstairs for the rest of your visit. <br><br>Now, this upstairs is huge. It has plenty of options from a meat counter, to seafood counter, deli, etc. Then it has plenty of restaurants that are essentially built it. It can look a little confusing until you understand the layout. But we always return to the overpriced groceries. <br><br>There are few things that my fiancee and I always get there. Brandini Moscato is one of the best. I dont know why I am telling you because I dont want everyone to buy it. But we love Moscato and we love Brandini. It is a little sweeter than your typical Moscato. <br><br>Then we must always get their pizza stuff. IE: Their flour for the pizza dough. As a chef, I dont know why I dont make my own pizza dough but this stuff is amazing. However, its becoming harder to find so maybe I will. Then they have plenty of options for Extra Virgin Olive Oil... if you want that EVOO over produced, fake stuff...go somewhere else. If you want to buy expensive true (hopefully), come here. <br><br>Typically, we will visit the pizza/pasta station/restaurant. Their pizzas are neopalitan style so it is very thin but they let the dough talk and not the topping. It is made in a pizza brick oven so the bottom is nicely charred. Amazing. The pasta is true al dente tho...so be forewarned. They do make their pasta with a good bite so if you like your pasta more, you may not like what they serve here. <br><br>My last visit, it was the best. We bought some aged Proscuitto and Guanciale. I was able to find it in the deli area, by the pre-packaged proscuitto. I dont know if they always carry it but there was a few pieces left and I got one. Will have to make Carbonara soon with it. Ive bought the proscuitto a few times and I always happy with their results. Nicely aged taste with a good saltiness to it. However, it is also very close to their cheese selection and unless you like the smell of aged cheese...be very careful on who you bring to this area. it is a little strong. <br><br>Overall, I know we overpay for all these grocery, but the quality is amazing and we only visit this location maybe once every few months..mainly for the Brandini Moscato.

To the center is cookbooks and sale items. And to the right, there are some food stalls. There's one for flatbreads and sandwiches, one for coffee, one for all things Nutella, one for gelato, and one for pastries. The gelato is great- I personally like a double flavor serving of caffe and fiordilatte. They also have a list of insalata flavors like basil, tomato, and black pepper parmesan. The pastries are gorgeous, and just as delicious as they look. The semifreddo was a bit tart for my liking. <br><br>Then there's the second floor. There is a classroom for events and classes, as well as a place to grab a glass of wine, coffee, a bakery cafe, a place for appetizers, a pizza place, a pub, and when I was most recently- a pop up restaurant called Roma (I think it ends May 28th- but check it out. The food was stellar). There's a produce section, a cheese and salami section, a butcher, a fishmonger, a bakery, a fresh pasta counter, a liquor section, an olive oil section, and honestly more that I'm probably forgetting. Get a prosciutto and mozzarella foccacia from the bakery- you won't be disappointed. It's all very open, and the staff is always friendly and helpful.

Would've been nice if the chefs were from Italy too, with an accent. But you don't always get what you ask for. <br><br>Listen, I care about the coffee the most. And their heavenly bread and olive oil. I don't care much about the tasty grilled branzino alla bagnara or the amazing agnolotti del plin pasta with Langhe truffles or their pizza napoletana or the inevitable Nutella bar. If you're new to Eataly, those former 4 things I recommend you try to start with.  Their restaurants food and quality range between 2.5979797 stars to 4.79849889 stars. The best item I tried at the whole store and keep coming back for is the olive oil. They have more than 100 olive oil kinds, I guess. Many of them are so good. I keep trying new ones every single time. The ones I pick are always nicely tart amazingly bitter perfectly rich Italian goodness olive oil. The olive oil you buy from regular stores are more like water compared to the real stuff here. I live few blocks from this place so it's lucky I don't run out on good olio d'oliva. <br><br>Personally, I measure coffee-serving stores based on their macchiato experience. Eataly coffee is Lavazza coffee!!  It's one of my favorites of all the time. So let's talk about some macchiato madness: <br><br>Macchiato at Eataly Chicago: 3.000001 stars. Tables are not always clean. Once, they never placed my order till I asked about it after 10 minutes waiting. Taste was fine (it should be very similar to other Eatalys). But the taste of anything depends not only on the ingredients. The mood and the love the chef/barista pours into make a difference. <br><br>Macchiato at Eataly Boston: 3.999994 stars. The store is cozier and as usual for Eataly stores, it's located perfectly 2 blocks from Newbury St. But the tables are not as sexy as the NYC Flatiron. <br><br>Macchiato at NYC Flatiron: the best!!! 4.99999998. Atmosphere, tables, photogenic level and the taste were all above 4.98989898 stars. This is my favorite Eataly so far. <br><br>Macchiato at NYC downtown, One World Center: 3.9797979, like the one in Boston. But tables are not as cute as the Flatiron. Taste was fine. <br><br>This chain was founded by a dude called Oscar from Piemonte region. He reminds me of an actor I can't remember.

The pizza might be considered good somewhere like California but not competitive to Chicago standards.   <br><br>I tried to just buy some meats, cheeses and pair a wine with it to put a platter together for some guests and it was hard to find anything without a thorough knowledge of Italian fare.  The wines were very hard to differentiate as well and in my quest to get something closer to a Pinot Noir I ended up with something that tasted more like Manischewitz wine.  The few items I picked out ended up being close to $100 and barely filled up a small bag.  <br><br>It's a fun place to experience and you can buy lots of novelty food and kitchen items, but it's confusing, very busy with long wait times, and came off as more of a tourist experience to me than a purveyor of traditional Chicago Italian food or provider of the ambience of other Chicago classics like La Scarola, Italian Village, Monte Verde, etc.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Went to check out this place from a recommendation of another friend.. there was everything at the place wine, cannoli, pasta, pizza , bread etc. we ended up sitting down at Osteria I think one of the eatery in Eataly .. hahah clever !!

The atmosphere is mesmerizing and the people watching is truly a great pastime. On our last visit November 17, 2018, we shopped and decided to sit down for a few minutes at Baita, the northern alps eatery upstairs. We had no reservations but were seated immediately. Our server was gracious and quick. We were given still (tap) water which is the Italian term and quickly looked at the menu, trying to take in all the options available. We settled on a Moscato wine, the charcuterie and cheese board, kale salad with radishes and apples and the Raclette cheese over pickled vegetables and crusty bread. Every taste was enjoyed, with no complaints about the food quality, service or price. Our small bites were more than generous for 2 people. If you have not visited Eataly, please make it a point to spend a couple hours in the store and restaurants and look into all the nooks and crannies they have.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The moment those doors open, our jaws dropped! We were wowed and our eyes continued to wonder from left to right up and down center and all the way around. We were hungry and wanted to try their specialty coffees. So we went straight to the Nutella bar and ordered the waffle sticks, but to our surprise, and apparently to the staff's surprise, they do not sell them there. Which we were shocked because we saw pictures of them all over Yelp and so anyways, we settled for the Nutella Crepe con la Banana. <br><br>We grabbed a table as soon as it became available. This place is definitely a touristy attraction and every traveler's destination. So it's SUPER SUPER busy and elbow to elbow place. It was snowing and the temperature outside was 18°F with a feels like 10°F so we had our snow boots and Parkas with us. The best thing to do is grab one of the store's stackable easy to maneuver buggy and place your coats on the bottom basket and keep the top basket open for your shopping and souvenirs. <br><br>Back to our first experience, so we live in Chicago but have never made time to come in because we knew it was always busy and it was a touristy place. So today we braved the weather elements and head out to get a taste of this place. My husband was NOT happy with the service at the Lavazza coffee station (mind you he is the sweetest person that will ever meet) he ordered my med. Latte Macchiato & his large Latte Macchiato. He specifically ordered them for here and requested a Mug for his. Well when his order came out they handed him mine in a cute glass latte cup and his in a large glass cup (which he was not happy bc it was super hot and almost SCALDED his hand. <br><br>He is the type of person that would not say what bothered to him to the staff just to be polite. So when he came back to the table I saw his facial expressions and it was a disappointing look. He explained to me what happened and I tried to convince him to go back and get his mug. He of course shrugged and said to me that the staff wS rude and had some attitude that he would just not rather go back and would just drink his beverage to avoid any more of that negative vive. <br><br>After we finished our hot beverages, I convinced him to give the store a chance and we checked out the other departments and found some great things for us to try like:<br><br>* Caffè Vergnano 1882 Miscelá Tostatura Lenta. Espresso ground coffee<br>* Valverbe Tiglio e FioriD' Arancio \"Lime & Orange\"<br>* Gorgonzola & Walnut Ravioli (fresh)<br>* Semolina Ciabatta Bread (fresh) from La Focacceria<br>* 4 pack of the pastries from the La Pasticceria. <br>* Strawberry stack pastry shop<br>* Torro from the pastry shop<br>* Del Tartufo Fresh cheese with truffles. <br><br>Aside from the Pasticceria, the rest of the staff members were not polite and lacked customer service experience. <br><br>When we got to the second floor, it was a total different feel. Every staff member was so polite and we got that warm welcoming feel. We stopped at the coffee shop on 2nd floor and talked to the barista at the Vergnano station and he was so sweet and knowledgeable about the different kinds of coffees etc and he told us about the stunning and WOW factor Espresso machine that makes 3at a time but they only use two of them at a time. It was a fantastic experience that we wished we would of waited and had our espressos upstairs versus down at the 1st floor. LESSON LEARNED. <br><br>We stopped by and checked out the area where they make the fresh breads and pastas. We are just gonna have to come back because it was really busy on a Saturday so we will make time on a week day to take our time and walk thru each section.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sDMMsbvrpO50dGqUE1oiJg/348s.jpg", "caption": "Hubby whistles as he loves this place"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hBhMhAPGHjkq0c0NKCi7qg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Just the perfect Vegan Latte to start my day!"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Awesome wine collection.

Be prepared to be overwhelmed by all that is going on as soon as you walk in.  Tip #1: just breathe and take it all in!  <br><br>I'll start off with an overview of the place.  There are five restaurants, 9 different counters ranging from a CANNOLI bar, a Panini bar, to a wine bar, TWO cafes, and of course a market where you can purchase meats, cheeses, produce, FRESH pasta, WINE, olive oil, mozzarella, and fresh baked bread and many other items.  <br><br>Tip #2: grab a glass of wine from the wine bar (Vino Libero, second floor) and take a stroll through the entire store one time to get a feel of the layout and where everything is.  I highly recommend taking a look at the menus posted in front of each restaurant as you are browsing and then put your name down for whichever one catches your eye.  During our visit, we decided to try something from a couple of the restaurants (more on that later).  Once you've taken a stroll through the entire store, you will probably be ready for another glass of wine!  Hopefully by now, you've decided on a place to eat and your name has been called.  If not, get that other glass of wine and keep strolling!  My third tip:  if you plan on purchasing meats, cheeses or anything perishable and will be travelling, they have insulated cooler bags available for purchase and the seafood department of the store will gladly give you a bag of ice.  Of course, you can bring your own too! Also, one of the great things is that they will gladly let you sample something before you make your purchase!<br><br>Okay, now that the logistical details are out of the way, let's move on to our amazing experience there!  Like I mentioned before, we were awestruck as soon as we walked in!  Unfortunately, we were not aware that you could walk around with a beer or wine as you strolled through the store, so we started our adventure with no drink in hand.  Nonetheless, we were having a great time. After reading the menus, there was no way we could settle on just one place to eat and instead decided to try something from a few restaurants.  We started off at Birreria, beer themed restaurant.  We took a seat at the bar and much to our surprise, they had Dogfish 120 on tap.  My boyfriend was in heaven.  We also ordered the Amatriciana, an arancini appetizer described as tomato risotto, crispy salumi, caramelized onions, cacao di roma.  IT WAS DELICOUS! I don't think there was a crumb left on our plates. <br><br>Now that our bellies had some food and alcohol in it, we thought it was best to continue strolling and making mental notes of what we were going to purchase to take back home.  We also noticed a cooking class taking place which I think would be an amazing time if you planned for that in advance.  Tip #3: reserve a cooking class in advance (you can find all the information on their website). <br><br>The next restaurant we decided to try was La Pizza & La Pasta which had Napoli-style pizza and al dente pasta.  Our amazing server walked us through the menu and gave us some great suggestions.  We went with two glasses of Pinot Noir and the Bucatini, described as hollow string pasta, guanciale, red onion, tomato, chili flake, pecorino romano.  OH MY GOD! This was probably the best pasta I've ever had!  Our server gave us a heads up that the pasta is served al dente like it is served in Italy, but was happy to cook the pasta through a little longer.  Our thought was when in Rome...or Eataly, you do as the Romans do and eat that pasta al dente!  I recommend everyone trying the pasta as it is described as well as splitting a dish as there is plenty to share! Once we devoured the entire plate of pasta, our server informed us we were free to walk around with our glasses of wine, which was perfect, because we were ready to make some purchases and stroll some more.  We do wish our server at the initial spot informed us of this, hence tip #2.  We decided on a few things to purchase: olive oil (which they also let you sample before making your purchase), ingredients to recreate the Bucatini (they have flyers with different recipes throughout the store), chocolates, a few different cheeses, and of course some cannolis!  In true Italian fashion, we ended our THREE HOUR adventure with a stop at the gelato bar.

And let me tell you, they were very generous with their pours (definitely more than a \"tasting\") but no complaints about that.<br><br>The menu:<br>- Canederli al Burro (traditional Venetian dumplings w/ butter)<br>- Gnocchi al Castelmagno (gnocchi with Castelmagno cheese)<br>- Gnocchi alla Romana con ragù alla Cacciatora (Roman-style gnocchi w/ Hunter-style ragù)<br><br>Jeremy and Peter did a wonderful job at demonstrating how these dishes were made but my favorite part was of course, tasting them. They were all delicious! For the hands on part, we made our own gnocchi from scratch and got to take them home to cook ourselves. Overall, a very enjoyable class and something fun to do on a Friday night!<br><br>As for the market itself, it's always a great place to wander around.

With this being said, I thought that I was going to have another great experience at the Chicago location and that was not that case. The products were all super cool and I loved walking through and looking at at the Italian goods, however the customer service and disorganization is the reason for this review. When I was at the upper level, I was simply trying to order a cheese plate from their mozzarella bar area. The server working there was explaining to me that I would have to sit down in their main restaurant area for somebody to help me. I wasn't sure why because he could have simply taken my order. I was in a rush so after sitting down for about 5-10 minutes we decided to just leave. Didn't get my cheese plate, pissed. Lastly, I wanted to get a cannoli before I left and the same disorganization of this location continued. They essentially have one line for both gelato and cannolis yet they have a cannoli stand saying \"order here\". Well I waited there while the two employees literally did not even acknowledge the fact that I was there for about 5 minutes. In the meantime, they were helping all of the other customers when they were paying for their gelato. Then it looked like they were having a problem with their refrigeration systems and it was just taking way to long so once again, had to leave without getting my cannoli, double pissed.

As much as I love to cook, I'm always interested in some more kitchen items. Soon enough my brother and nephew are telling me we have to go upstairs to get a pizza. If there is a reason to go upstairs, well pizza is about is good as it gets! We got the margherita pizza. This pizza was so good! Simple, yet done perfectly. Oh did I mention I stopped at their bakery and picked up a few pieces of foccaccia to snack on. So good. The second floor is nuts. There are more food stations that Joey Chestnut wouldn't be able to hit them all in a single visit. I mentioned the bakery, there's fish, meats, pasta, oh my. If you can tear yourself away from the food, there's good olive oil, enough wine to get half of Chicago drunk, pasta and pasta sauces and plenty of other goodies. Since we were in town visiting and heading home in the morning, I called Visa and advised them to not be alarmed. We hit up some of the grocery isles to get some great Italian tomatoes and some other goodies. Then we went back to the bakery to get some more of their excellent bread. Next stop was the fresh pasta bar. Really fresh pasta?!?! I've been to a lot of places over the years and this is the first place I've found where you can purchase fresh made pasta. It was then off to find my brother and nephew as we needed more hands. Picked up some meatballs, fresh cheese and some aged meats. Dinner tomorrow night was going to be something special. We checked out and as much as we purchased, their prices are actually very reasonable. Considering the quality of the items and we're shopping in a huge building in Chicago, a bottle of water could have easily been $10.00!<br>Eatily is they type of place you want to visit whether you live in Chicago or you're just visiting.

Second of all that customer SHOULD BE BANNED. Why on earth would you let someone act like that to another one of your customers. That is an immediate cause for removal. It should never be a second or third incident. This should have been solved at a much earlier date to ensure the safety of customers. Secondly. Why on earth would your employees knowingly enable this behavior and not put an immediate end to this harassment towards other customers.  Why would they not immediately ask what happened and remove that customer from that establishment IMMEDIATELY. Instead we were met with hostility and indifference. This was an awful experience. From start to finish. An employee enabled a customer (who Is known to do these things in the store) to accost my girlfriend multiple times and scream obscenities in the store. This is Garbage customer service. Plain and simple. I'm absolutely livid. I can not believe that this was allowed to happen. This employee should be fired. The customer should<br>Be BANNED. There should've have been immediate follow through and nothing was done. I hope this establishment makes this right and can provide a safe environment for the customers.

I'm more of a fruity berry type of person when it comes to gelato, so I always go for the berry or citrusy flavors. Although the Lemon gelato was delicious, I decided to go for the Mixed Berry. I always have the toughest time choosing and that is in general. I am always standing there for over 10 minutes debating on which flavors to choose from, so I kept going back and forth with my second flavor, but I decided to be bold and I chose Tiramisu. It was definitely a good combination and the scoops were fairly reasonable for the cost. <br><br>Pricing: <br>- 1 Scoop - $3.90<br>- 2 Scoops - $4.90<br>- 3 Scoops - $5.90<br>- Flavor of the Day - 1 Scoop - $1<br><br>Overall, I really enjoyed going to Eataly, I wish I had more time to explore the supermarket and the small food shops they had there, but then I would probably ending up spending a lot of money on snacks and trying new food items.

What you can choose from to eat is dictated by where you sit, which is actually a drawback in my opinion. There is, for example, an area by the seafood counter. There you can get a wide range of food from that section but very little from other areas of the store which are all in very close proximity. There are two more formal sit down restaurants side by side, with no physical division, where you can order a variety of foods divided into the traditional Italian scheme of antipasti, primo, secondo and dolce courses, but you can't order interchangeably from the two menus.

The waiter wanted to add Parmigiano to my Buccatini a la Gricia- an act that would get you thrown out of Rome! ( It's a Roman dish so it gets Romano). But none of that was really troubling. I was there with a friend, so we just split the bill, signing our receipts and finishing our wine....partly our own fault, I suppose for not noticing we were being swindled - Took a glance at my bill saw the 20% suggested gratuity, and blithely added it, as did my friend with his check..HOWEVER, when I got home it dawned on me , did I just pay $75 for a bowl of pasta and a glass of wine? And the I checked the receipt in my wallet. On a $55 meal there idea of a 20% tip was $20 ( 20% of 55 is 11, and the 55 was including the tax). I called my friend, who didn't realize it either and his bill was the same $55, with a $20 tip..so we each essentially paid a 40% tip  for \"so so\" service, Our fault for not looking , but definitely their fault for ripping us off....I'll post the receipt later..but in case  Italy they reads it was --8/27 check no.16774 server 1045/Brian Cashier 1045/Brian", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Eataly is possibly one of my favorite locations to bring out-of-town friends for a unique dining and shopping experience. Just two floors high, the venue houses both high quality Italian specialty grocery items (olive oil, wine, ravioli cutters, you name it) and a bevy of delicious restaurant choices to choose from. We recently went to La PIzza & La Pasta for a late lunch around 1pm early this week. The host stand gets a bit crowded, but you simply put your number in, and they'll send you a text within 15-20 minutes. If you're not in the mood for a wait, the other restaurants had plenty of empty seats with tasty looking menu items. Once seated, we ordered the Pappardelle al Ragù di Manzo, one of their fresh pasta dishes served with thick noodles in a rich brisket sauce. Absolute al dente perfection. Of course, this came after our dual order of classico pizzas, one Massese with spicy salami, basil and mozzarella followed immediately by the Capricciosa, a magical experience of artichoke, prosciutto, black olives and mushrooms. Amongst the three people in our company, we polished off all three dishes within 20 minutes. The pizza dough, if you're ordering the traditional, is just the right balance of crispy and chewy. The toppings punch through and marry with the texture in a glorious symphony of flavors. The line is definitely worth your time.<br><br>Downstairs, you can satisfy your dessert cravings with assorted chocolates, a gelato bar, a new canoli bar, and even a nutella crepe station. Whatever your heart desires, whether coffee, wine, or ale, you can find a beverage of choice on the second floor. I believe Eataly also hosts wine tastings and cheese tours if you so choose. For the carnivore in your life, the butcher shops are thriving and a fascinating look around if you need to burn some time before heading off to lunch. For the bookworm, there is even a small cookbook nook next to the cafe on the second floor. A fantastic experience overall, albeit with a slightly hefty price tag.

Both pastas came out perfectly al dente. Note - the spaghetti is simple - a light sprinkling of cheese and black pepper. Great combo to really get the taste and texture of the spaghetti. The squid ink pasta comes with steamed mussels too! <br><br>Both are REALLY filling! <br><br>We had to walk around the store afterward to help us digest all that we ate.

The pizzas were fresh out of the stone oven, but the crust does get a little soggy after sitting on the table. The pasta and ravioli dishes we ordered were bombtastic! I ordered the squid ink pasta which was made from fresh pasta and it was amazing. The sauce was full of seafood flavor. <br><br>I also got myself a little Italian lemonade \"La Limonada\", imported straight from Italy! I like how they serve it with the bottle and a cup of ice, then pour the lemonade into my glass. Really great service! We also got gelato from downstairs and I loooved the Chocolate Hazelnut flavor! Really smooth and creamy and not too sweet. I preferred it over the pistachio which I found to be too sweet. We also visited the Nutella bar, the Caffe Lavazza (got the Piemonte and it was really good!), and ran around the entire place like little kids in the candy store. <br><br>tl;dr: Really fun place to explore Italian food!

Another dislike is that u cant drink the bottle u just bought in the store or they wont open it for u? ADVICE DONT BUY A GLASS OF WINE BUY THE BOTTLE ITS CHEAPER.  It is very big like huge picture like a Walmart with two floors minus 1 star because of bad service minus another star because of the restaurants being crappy i love coming here though its a must stop everytime i come to chicago!<br><br>Regarding the store: i like how they have everything here what that means is u can buy truffles here this is the only<br>Place in chicago that sells them. Then they sell sea urchin u have to call and buy it early though. They have a lot of exotic things here like black garlic only place i ever seen it. Then they import everything from italy so it is very authentic. The only problems is sometimes the food can be old like the oranges might be supper hard and dry stuff like that so watch out for that<br><br>Regarding the wine: i love the wine here  best i ever had. I never had i wine here that i didnt like. What i would recommend is to try alot of wines and buy the \"bottle\" u like not buy a glass! Buy a bottle because its cheaper n u get more for the buck! Not all of the wine is cold though only certain ones are they need to fix that! Then u cant drink the bottle u just bought in the store or they wont open for u!!!! They need to fix that! <br><br>Regarding the food shops: I been to the oyster bar i highly recommend that they have the best most freshest oysters ever! And the condiments for them is really good! There meat and cheese plate is also very delicous i recommend that. Then the pastries are really delicous some arent as great as others but they are really tasty. I recommend going to the shops versus the restaurants cause there not that good<br><br>Regarding the restaurants: pizza/ pasta place whatever they call it i would never wait in line to eat here cause its not that good.

I was excited to find pistachio cream which I love to use when I make cannoli. The store items were reasonably priced for the uniqueness of the products. My pistachio cream was around $10 which was reasonable since Williams-Sonoma charges almost $20 per jar.<br><br>Personally, I was disappointed in the dessert selection. My husband had gelato and when I sampled it I was glad that I wasn't wasting the calories. It was not even close to delicious. The assorted desserts didn't look that impressive. I did settle on a small tiramisu and cannoli. The tiramisu was very tasty and rich, but the cannoli was just okay. I also expected an area of fresh baked Italian cookies like I get in Little Italy and there weren't any. I live for Italian cookies so this was a bummer.<br><br>I typically pay no attention to prices when it comes to food, but this place is overpriced.

The orange is without any orange flavor but artificial over-sweet taster with basil, like the soap. Mixed-berries sorbet flavor is also too sweet with artificial flavor.

Maybe some of the best pasta I've had outside of Italy. All their pastas are cooked al dente and retain an excellent hardness without being undercooked. The two pastas we shared were the Tagliatelle al Ragu di Manzo and the Vesuvio con Salsiccia e Rape.<br><br>Tagliatelle:<br>Housemade tagliatelle with short rib ragu, parmigiano reggiano, and extra virgin olive oil. This was everyone's favorite. Here at La Pasta, they do not overdo the sauce. Rather, they add just enough that it complements the pasta while still letting the perfectly-cooked noodles shine through. The pieces of short rib were soft and tender, melting in your mouth and into the sauce. This could have been a very rich and heavy dish, but it succeeded in using only a few ingredients and keeping it simple.<br><br>Vesuvio:<br>A uniquely shaped pasta with sweet sausage, broccoli rabe, chili flakes, parmigiano reggiano, and pecorino. This was especially good as a change from the tagliatelle dish. It wasn't quite as memorable or bold, but certainly still tasty. The pasta shape was very different from any I've had before; short and curled, reminding me of a mushroom for some reason. Overall, still a solid dish with great flavor.<br><br>We had a very thoughtful waiter. He split our check between groups without us even asking, which was a big help, and he was happy to bring us any garnishes we needed.<br><br>IL FRITTO (part of LA PIAZZA on the 2nd floor):<br><br>We only got one thing here, an order of the arancini. We wanted to try the meat and cheese platter as well, which was well-priced at about $20, but were too full from the pasta.<br><br>Arancini:<br>Saffron risotto balls stuffed with pork and veal ragu and peas, then fried. A $13 order comes with 5 medium-sized risotto balls. This was only my second time having arancini, but I loved it even better than the first. The most dominant flavor was the rice, as it should be. Inside the light breading it was fragrant and creamy rather than overpowered by the saffron or meat. <br><br>MARKET:<br><br>When I was looking over the meat selections, the man behind the counter very kindly told me that he was happy to answer any of my questions. He also told me that this was a great place to wander for hours and that everyone who worked there was deeply passionate about what they did. It was wonderful talking to someone who so clearly cared about his work and establishment, without any sense of snobbery or condescension.<br><br>Many of the girls in my group ended up buying various pastas or other goodies to take home to California.

For the record, I've been here twice, but I choose not to venture downtown that often. The first time was just to scope it out and see what all of the fuss was about. The second time was to bring family from out of town since it's pretty damn impressive. <br><br>I'll admit, the first time I came here I was extremely overwhelmed and didn't know where to begin. I damn near had a panic attack. The food court area, if you can call it that, is a little confusing at first. I was under the impression that you could just get whatever you want from whichever counter you want and eat in a common area, but the counters on the upstairs level are actually sectioned off as individual restaurants with waitstaff, so you have to make some tough decisions. It's kind of a nightmare if you're an indecisive person. If you're looking to do things more a la carte, you can do so on the first floor, but there aren't as many options. It's mostly just coffee, dessert and paninis on the first floor. Upstairs is where you get the seafood, pasta, etc. <br><br>Shopping here is a no-brainer if you're an Italian aficionado. If not, you might not think it's that great. It's not really the sort of food market where you can just do all of your grocery shopping because there are a lot of essential items that you're not going to find here. For example, the produce section is not that large, but I did pick up some killer mushrooms here. They weren't magic, but they sure did make a great pasta sauce! Okay....no more dad jokes.<br><br>Back to business. If you're going to dine at one of the restaurants, be prepared to drop some major dough for dough. I am not one to spend a lot of money on pasta. In fact, it's one of my biggest pet peeves since it is literally the cheapest and easiest thing to make at home. But when in Rome!

As a huge fan of authentic Italian food, I am in love with this concept. I stayed at the Hilton just around the corner from Eataly and no joke probably came here three or four times in a four-day trip. The extensive counters with meat, cheese, homemade pasta and snacks are drool worthy. I wished I could have bought stuff to take home with me, but I'm guessing none of it would have fared well on a plane ride. I had lunch at the pasta/pizzeria. I started out the meal with olive oil and bread - simple but delicious, just like in Italy. I had the cacio e pepe for lunch and it was so, so good. Cacio e pepe is one of my favorite Italian meals. Even though it is very simple (spaghetti, butter, parmesan and black pepper), it is rich and delicious, and Eataly's version did not disappoint. Although the pasta wasn't from the homemade menu, it was cooked to a perfect al dente with the rich sauce and just amazing and exactly what I wanted. If I lived close to an Eataly, it'd probably be dangerous because I'd be in for delicious, authentic Italian pasta dishes a few times a week.

Downstairs is more like Italian IKEA with a section to buy all kinds of house goods and tchotchkes on one side and various places to grab snack-like items (coffee, nutella crepe bar, gelato, baked goods, juice bar) on the other. The upstairs is like organized chaos. There's all kinds of places to grab food or sit down. We found a table towards the back near the olive oil section (at Osteria(?)). Anyhow, the absolute best part of the meal was the burrata appetizer (although pretty overpriced at $21) and pappardelle di anatra (well worth $21). Seriously, the latter was the best pasta I've had since leaving Italy. Granted, I almost never eat pasta (still doing the low to no gluten thing) - so there's not a ton to compare to there. However, it was certainly better than the cannelloni ($22). The gnocchi also, unfortunately, didn't shine (a bit disappointing at $17). The friend shrimp app at $16 was both overpriced and oily. Between 5 people, each with a main dish, 2 appetizers, 1 glass of wine and an iced tea - the total was a whopping $145 pre-tax and tip. With the pasta being made in-house, I expected to be blown away for that amount of money. While it was mostly tasty, it wasn't great. If I lived in the area, I might give the upstairs food area another try, but probably would just go back with a smaller group. As a visitor with so many other offerings in that area, I won't be back. <br><br>Parking lot is in the building the next street over. There is no connection to Eataly itself and other businesses share the space, so it was pretty full the evening we went. <br><br>Closing irritation: they are supposed to cover for 3 hours of parking in their lot if you spent at least $10 (this is posted all over the place). We spent over $200 between dinner, purchasing various items, coffee, and gelato - and we still had to pay $11 for parking with the validation. Normally, I would have went back in to ask for more validation. However, it was ~15-20 degrees and we had to pick up waiting family.

Hodge podge of both? <br><br>So, I googled and according to Wikepedia, Eataly is a \"high-end food market/mall\". I also saw that it's an \"Italian superstore\". According to Eataly's website, it's an \"original marketplace model for consumers to be active participants in an innovative food and beverage experience......blah, blah, blah....<br><br>Anyway, I ran through many emotions during this experience.....some excitement, some confusion, some frustration, overwhelmed, and some delight.  I spent 3 hours there and I definitely plan to return with girlfriends.

Validated parking was only $10 in the \"official\" Eataly parking garage on 10 E. Grand.(with $20 purchase)<br>2. The food and gelato was really good<br>3.

I saw various eating areas/restaurants, but it wasn't obvious what they were or what they served.<br>2. At times, I felt like I needed a staff person to walk around and explain things to me. For instance, there were approx. 100 different brands/types of olive oil to choose from. Same as the pasta. If you don't know EXACTLY what you're looking for, you better have some time on your hands to ponder over the huge selection.<br>3. Speaking of the staff......many of them weren't very friendly.

My first time here was 3 years ago and the food was pretty good. This time was terrible. First, let me just say that I know the Italian food. I am Italian and go to Italy every summer where I have a family home, so I know how pasta is made there. Anyway, the waitress here was not nice or helpful at all as I was asking her about stuff on the menu. My concern was that I wanted something with no pork. Most restaurants offer to make anything without pork, but they did not. I ended up ordering the cacio e pepe and my mom had the ziti. We also ordered an arugula salad. The arugula salad came and it was just arugula on a plate with some Parmesan sprinkled on it. I couldn't believe this was an $11 salad, simply a hand full of arugula. This salad should have been $6 at most. Fast forward to the pasta, my mom's ziti were raw. This was not al dente as the waitress claimed. I know 100 percent how pasta is made in Italy and I've never eaten pasta like this there. This pasta tasted like they simply soaked raw pasta in hot water for five minutes. Mine was a little more edible. However, after taking a few bites, it was just way too salty. I couldn't have more. We couldn't wait more for them to make us new dishes. The manager came and refunded us for the pasta. Still, we had to pay $20 for soft drinks and lettuce. Not to mention, time wasted. I could have taken my $20 and actually had a meal somewhere else. Bottom line, this place is overpriced and it's not even about the price because the quality is not that good. I wouldn't mind paying if the food was actually decent.

I hesitated at first, and chose to sample some other juices, but then tried that black poison like drink, and realized why that was the juice for me. It was made with lemon, rosemary, cucumber, alkaline water, raw agave, and of course, infused with activated charcoal.

I've had the Salsicciotta pizza at Eataly and while it was really good it wasn't worth $17.

I've been to Italy twice and during my time there I never saw any candy that was this expensive so I don't know why Eataly feels they can jack up the price like this. If the candy they sold here was like those massive \"diabetics here I come\" candies that you find at FAO Schwarz, well then I could understand charging $20+, but they aren't.<br><br>3) They have a wire basket for $108! When my friend and I saw this we literally did a triple take. $110 for a wire basket that can hold a couple apples and oranges..seriously?!

There's just about every meal of the day served here, and my party and I almost tried them all. <br><br>We decided to put our names down for La Pizza & La Pasta because we were in the mood for some carb overload. The host told us it would be a 45 minute wait so in that time we made our way to the baked breads section and split between the three of us a sausage, pepper, and onion focaccia for a whopping $6.80. It was a good slice of foccacia with tasty sausage and the cashier was nice enough to let us big the slice; however it was definitely a $5 slice which is a gripe that many people seem to have about this place.<br><br>After much pushing and shoving (this place is insanely packed) we made our way to the wine area. My friend asked if we could sample and the cashier met her request with a scowl- i guess we didn't look like the kind of people that had money to be spending on wine, but I do appreciate visibly better customer service. The cashier gave her a tasting glass though, and eventually we ended up getting a glass to share. I believe it was moscato and it tasted just like juice- delicious!<br><br>We made our way back to the crowding dining area of La Pizza & La pasta and were seated after just a half hour. The bread that they start tables off with is excellent! I only wish they would put Parmesan cheese on top of the olive oil. We ordered a quatro formaggi, papardelle, and tagliatelle. The tagliatelle was my absolute favorite because of the chewy texture and the short rib that accompanied it. My pizza was pretty good and the papardelle was unique and flavorful as well. I had to flag down our server for extra parmesean on top of our dishes, but other than that service was top notch.<br><br>Dessert is a must here; they offer so many unique flavors of gelato and they have the infamous nutella bar. I don't see what the big deal is about a nutella bar although crepes + nutella are something I don't have the luxury of getting too often. My girlfriend got a nutella sandwich cookie which tasted exactly how i expected it to, but I would rather have spent the $6 on a jar of nutella for myself. For gelato, we split salted caramel, pistachio, and tiramisu. The tiramisu tasted the most like regular ice cream but we really appreciated the salted caramel and pistachio for their rich flavor and soft texture.<br><br>I did not bother looking at any of the grocery items here as they are really really expensive.

However, there's a big disconnect in the eating experience vs. the shopping experience. <br><br>COLD WHEAT BREAD<br>Finally, when we ordered I asked for fried eggplant instead of a pork panini  because it was a special written on a board and our waiter said, \"I need to go ask someone if we still have it?\" So he walked off and came back about five minutes later. In the meantime, someone else brought us cold, sliced wheat bread in a basket. Wheat? Really. Not crusty Tuscan bread. But wheat? Ick. Cold. Meanwhile, you can see the fresh, golden bread being sold in the distance. So why deliver wheat bread? Just bad choice? Not sure. <br><br>GLUTTONS FOR PUNISHMENT <br>We ordered arugula salads, shrimp and a couple plates of fried eggplant. These were just little plates and they were disappointing. Clumps of arugula on a plate; thickly sliced eggplant that was over-fried and dry shrimp. <br><br>BAD SERVICE UPSTAIRS & DOWNSTAIRS<br>Then, a few of us were still hungry so we decided to go downstairs. There's a sandwich shop by the entrance and my friend ordered a cold sandwich (as opposed to one that's warmed up to melt cheese.) She was the second person in line and we waited 20 minutes for her sandwich. She had to go up to the counter and ask about it , as did three other people who were waiting. This is \"take out?\" The sandwich was met with an \"Meh\" from one of our friends. <br><br>Meanwhile, another one of my friends decided to order a coffee, and also pick up a hot chocolate for another friend at the coffee station next door. The guy taking the order didn't understand that she was ordering TWO drinks and she had to explain it she wanted one coffee AND one hot chocolate = TWO separate drinks. And, she had another long wait for the drinks. Sigh. <br><br>IT'S JUST A FOOD COURT WITH BAD SERVICE & IMPORTED GOODS<br>The people who work there are not well trained. The whole place needs to a good ole' fashioned Six Sigma overhaul. Maybe hire people who can cook, know how to talk to customers and have culinary imaginations. <br><br>LESSON LEARNED: If you want a better Italian food experience -- head over to Siena Tavern.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "We love eataly- for groceries, sandwiches, charcuterie!

Most of the displays look more like museum pieces than something someone would actually buy, and some of it is SO expensive I don't know how anyone could buy it.<br>As for the food, I love the way they have the different options for casual counter service vs. sit down. I had a glass of wine to walk around with while I 'shopped', and then we sat at a counter for a while to have a meat and cheese plate with bread which was also pretty good but not spectacular. My least favorite food item was actually the pizza which I tried while sitting at another counter area, right near where they make the pizzas.

Yummy! <br><br>My husband loves their coffee.  Every time we go in, without fail, we go get a coffee.  Although I don't drink coffee, I love their Biscottis and usually end up eating the one that comes with his coffee. <br><br>Service at the restaurants can be a bit varied.  Sometimes it is excellent and other times it is just average.  Most of the servers tend to be knowledgeable about their product, but every now and then we get someone who doesn't and tries to fake it.  <br><br>THE MARKET:<br>On more than one occasion, we pick up meat/cheese/deli/veggies for dinner. Yes, it is more expensive than your typical grocery store.  I find that their prices are comparable to specialty stores like PQM and is somewhat on par with Whole Foods.  However, the quality is excellent. <br><br>If you lose me in Eataly, you can probably find me at the cheese counter.  Their cheese counter is on steroids - it is HUGE.  They are not limited to Italian cheeses but have a great selection of any cheese you'd like. They are also helpful in guiding you to try new cheese and let you sample it first so you know exactly what you are buying. <br><br>Both the produce and the meat/seafood counters just look appetizing with very fresh ingredients.  From the fish to the lamb to the Ribeye steak, everything we have had was excellent. It makes you want to cook (and of course, we usually stop by the wine shop and pick up a bottle too).  Also, Eataly has a gluten free pasta that is one of the better ones according to my gluten-free friends.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This place is like Disney World for food! I love going here because there are always so many options and nothing is super pricey. Everything tastes fresh, homemade, and flavorful. <br><br>The pizza and pasta restaurant is my favorite. They serve a perfect margherita pizza -- simple, light, but flavorful tomato sauce, a crispy and puffy crust, and fresh mozz. The norcina pizza is incredible. It still rocks a fresh and light taste, but is also deliciously creamy and truffled. I love that, if you sit at the bar, you can endlessly stare at them making these beautiful pizzas.<br><br>With regards to the pasta, I usually stick to their homemade ones. They taste fresh and soft and almost melt in your mouth. The menu does change seasonally, but they always have the tagliatelle with short rib ragu, which is a guaranteed good meal. I also love the spring pea ravioli, which is creative and refreshing. I'm not a big fan of the pasta al Nero, which I found too peppery and spicy. This is usually one of my favorite dishes and I don't think they do it well.<br><br>In addition to regular sit down restaurants, it's a lot of fun to just grab a glass of wine and browse or stand at a table or grab a snack. The focaccia station is always worth stopping by -- personally, I like their simple rosemary focaccia bread, but everything else is pretty great too (even the sweet ones!). I love shopping through the cheese and pasta sections - they make their own mozzarella and it's delicious and you can also buy the homemade pastas from the restaurant. The prosciutto is sliced right off of a big hunk of meat and tastes so fresh, salty, and amazing. The wine section is also amazing and the employees are super helpful. There's good espresso, amazing Nutella crepes, and awesome gelatto and pastries. No matter what you're into, it's honestly just so much fun.

There is a side that has more pasta type menu and then there is the more casualish area  which are high top tables and against the fish monger etc here and there. We ordered the daily special of various meats--I think it was a pistaccio mortadela and goat cheese with apricot jam and bread. We sat near the fish area so we ordered the special there which was a fried fish basket type deal. They will also bring you ice cold mini san pelligrinos if you ask for them.

Stopped in this past Sat afternoon, because a family member who's a senior citizen needed a cold drink and a place to get out of the heat and off her feet for a few mins.  We chose Eataly for convenience, their delicious iced coffee and usually good service. Ground floor cafe area had no empty seats and a long line.  We saw a sign for an espresso bar upstairs and tried there.  We stood in line up there, only to learn they don't serve any iced drinks at that bar.  We should have read the area menu more carefully before waiting.  By then, one of us really needed to get off our feet, and we hadn't seen any available seating other than in the full-on restaurant service areas, where we did not want to take up a table or food bar spots.  We asked, Where did they suggest we might sit, and were directed to either: a) the wine bar area upstairs,  or b) the cafe downstairs (which we had already seen was not an option). <br><br>With one of us at this point being fairly physically unable to continue running around this very large food emporium, we found the upstairs wine bar area quickly and sat down at one of the tall cocktail type tables (each of which had 4 seats, and which we would have been more than happy to share).  I then told my senior relative, Wait here while I take a spin around this top level to look for a cold drink.<br><br>I returned about two mins later (empty handed) to find an employee in the process of kicking my senior relative out of her chair in quite rude language and tone!  My relative was courteously trying to explain her exhaustion and thirst, and the hunt we had already undertaken, but the employee was insistent.  I walked up and said, She needs a rest and we've been running all around your store.<br><br>Rather than understand that it might not be a great idea -- for them or us -- to force us out of our seats at that moment, or react with any form of kindness or assistance, the Eataly employee looked at me blankly and continued to kick us off the seats!  I courteously asked to speak to the manager, believing that s/he would see swiftly how better to handle what should be a simple thing.  <br><br>The employee said, Its the manager who told me to kick you out of here.  I repeated I'd like to speak to the manager then, please.  One arrived with a nasty look on his face from the get-go.  I asked him if he was the manager, and he replied, I'm one of them.  I courteously repeated our experience thus far, and our explanation of our needs, and the fact that an Eataly employee had directed us to this seating area.  I also mentioned that we enjoy Eataly in NYC.<br><br>The manager then said, This is a 4-top and we must sit 4 people here.  (We saw no other people nearby who looked like they were waiting for a 4-top.)  I replied that we completely understood that the company would prefer to have the revenue of a party of 4 at that table, and that we would gladly move somewhere else to a 2-top or other appropriate type of seating.... and where should we go?  The manager's response at that point was to say, Ok walk around now and look for some!  I repeated for maybe the 19th time that we had just searched essentially their entire store bottom to top, and that my relative was overheated and exhausted which is why we came in to begin with, etc.  I asked the manager if someone could please help us look for two seats elsewhere?  Already unbelievable, right?<br><br>He squinted and grimaced at us before going off in a huff, apparently to look for seats (although he didn't say). A few mins later, he returned and said, There are no seats available in the areas where you normally should be!  After discovering this for himself, he finally pointed to two seats in a neighboring full-service restaurant area (that appeared to be for people wanting to eat a meal), and said, I will let you sit there.  We moved immediately and quietly, I ran back downstairs and stood in line again (no one helped me get faster service there, which some nice managers might have done in the situation), and then I ran back up to finally deliver one iced cappucino to my tired senior.  Note that, while we rested there, TWO ladies sat at the table we had just been kicked out of, where they were allowed to remain for glasses of wine.<br><br>In short, we experienced rudeness and inconsideration, on top of disorganization and unkindness.  Maybe by mentioning NYC, I caused them to expect us to be difficult and rude?  How awful, if true!  We can honestly say, in more than 6 years of visiting the Eataly in NYC, in both busy and quiet times, with both seniors and young children, that this type of treatment of customers would never fly in the NYC shop.  And from a manager yet!  Very disappointing, Eataly Chicago.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I love this place!

Our genius idea of grabbing apps at multiple restaurants as we walked around the store wasn't so genius after all, as two restaurants in we were overwhelmed and full.<br><br>We ended our evening at \"La Piazza\" with an order of the \"Grande Piatto Misto Di Formaggi\" which provided a great and classic assortment of Italian cheeses. No surprises on this board. It's just the best of the best, and you've probably had everything before. What made this selection so great was the honey. Ohhhhhh man, the honey and almonds (along with some chopped dates and apricots) were a treat. The board comes with a good amount of cheese and I'd suggest not getting anything else.<br><br>We ordered the \"Verdure Miste\" which was a plate of lightly fried seasonal veggies. They were good but felt like overkill and a waste of calories. They were certainly perfectly cooked and high quality.<br><br>We started out our dinner at \"La Carne\" which offers a pretty fantastic array of proteins to pick from.

Three thick slices, perfectly crisped up on the sides right before serving. <br><br>My dish was a show stopper! Two days later and I'm still lusting after it's luxurious flavor and texture.

The loose meat is served in a loosely packed patty and is covered in intensely delicious olive oil and salt. <br><br>Served with warmed grilled slices of quality bread the dish was heaven on my tongue. Not that I don't already eat my share of beef, but if all cow was served this way I would request all my hamburg to be raw. Devine. The warmth of the bread perfectly contrasted with the cold meat, and the longer I let the bread sit on the plate, the more olive oily it got. By the end, my face was dripping with delicious carnage. <br><br>Truly a devine and reverent preparation of a high quality piece of meat. Paired with a great glass of wine, it was a perfect meal.

It gets even more confusing when you factor in the leased spaces for Nutella, coffee, gelato etc. each with their own pay stations. <br><br>There is also very few clear places to eat. You may find yourself eating basically in the middle of people shopping all around you. They need to redesign the upstairs to create a food court of sorts.

The frutti do mate was good. The salmon & shrimp were over cooked but the flavor was on par. It was so busy and chaotic in there. You don't know where something stops and ends. One restaurant is seat yourself the other is hostess seats you, but the only distinction is a few oak barrels and a couple of garbage cans. I also don't like retail establishments inside restaurants like Cracker Barrel. If they were selling only wine & olive oil then maybe.

We wait long time for waiter to greet us and then long time to give us menu and then long time to take our order simple salumi plate and I ordered a bottle of wine from their wine list, from what they show to the customers. The waiter came after ling time to telling me that they don't have this bottle,so I ordered second different bottle from the wine list and I told him for a third bottle in case they don't have the one I asked for . After long time a manager came holding a bottle of wine completely different from what I asked, just trying to up sale even more expensive wine than I asked or thinking I don't know what I ordered.Anyway at that time our food was almost finished but we still never had wine , so I asked at least for two glasses of wine and I chose the mist expensive wine by the glass they have . The manager brought  an almost empty bottle of Barolo ,warm like tea and taste like vinegar and not enough for two so after he finished the last drops in my friend glass he went to look for more and left us again speechless without any attempt to give us a complimentary a glass of wine or even take all dunner ftom our check because this was the worst experience I had , my friend was very disappointed as well and we left without continue our dinner like we planned. Nobody told us sorry or give a little excuse for they unprofessional attitude and very very mediocre service , the bottom of the line of the atrocious service . We left normal tips to the waiter . Anyway at least somebody must be happy , obviously the owners don't care for their customers but how to make money because everything is so revoltingly over priced , but the quality of the service is very law , very mediocre lavel .

Of course, you do get the entire history and story of the family posted above that chocolate bar, so you can feel righteous about supporting the poor Italian peasants who've been laboring barefoot in the Piedmont hills since 1320, subsisting only on their hand-pressed olive oil, where they joyfully stomp their own grapes, laughing and singing their traditional Piedmontese arias and . . . you get the picture, right?

The croissant was so hard and dry, she returned it after one bite and got a refund. I had a roll with Nutella. The roll was tough and chewy. Do yourself a favor; buy a jar of Nutella at your local grocery store, and slather it on your own biscuits at home. The Nutella bar is terrible.<br><br>The only surprising thing about Eataly is that it is not located at Navy Pier. The place is a complete and total tourist trap.

I'd rather pay $20 for a bottle of L'Occitane shampoo since I actually know and trust the brand.

I have been waiting for Eataly's arrival (like the rest of the Midwest apparently) ever since they announced it was coming. The rational part of me told me to wait a few more months before visiting, while the food lover in me encouraged me to visit sooner rather than later. <br><br>I decided to skip the Piazza dining experience and the Nutella Bar Chaos (wha???). Nothing against the Chefs behind the Piazza, but Chicago has some great places for dining and I just figured I'd have a relaxing lunch someplace else and then check out the other things Eataly has to offer. Besides, I think I'd much prefer dining at Baffo (on my list!) but that's just me. <br><br>When I arrived, I went right upstairs and had a drink at the Birreria. It was not crowded as compared to the Piazza, and I found a seat at the bar easily. The beer selection is very nice and offers a few local brews and many Italian brews. I enjoyed my Del Borgo Rubus Lamponi (a fruit ale that was very sour) and I enjoyed chatting with the beer staff. They were very knowledgeable and fun to talk to. They offer some small plate meals here as well. <br><br>After my drink, I checked out the wines for purchase--so many bottles! Bubbly, Rose, Reds, Whites, Ports. So fun to browse. The wine bar was not crowded either so that seemed like a nice way to enjoy a drink away from the crowded Piazza. <br><br>I loved the shopping experience. I loved browsing through the different pastas, sauces, jams, meats, cheeses, coffee, chocolates. The selection has the potential to inspire any level of home chef to make some awesome meals at home. What I do love about Eataly is that the ingredients of your meal can be purchased on site. Same with the drinks. like what you had at the Birreria? You can purchase the bottle (and more!) for home. <br><br>I ended up purchasing some fresh pasta, truffle cream sauce, prosecco jam, chocolates and this amazing nougat/hazelnut snack. I would have purchased some wines but still had a long afternoon ahead of me and didn't want to lug all my bottles around the city. <br><br>Staff is friendly. The space coloring reminded me of Crate and Barrel.

I walked in with the intention of just walking around and then enjoying a crepe from the Nutella bar, but Eataly sucked me in (and I let myself get sucked in).<br><br>We started out our tour of the entire place with the grocery store, which features dairy products, fruit and vegetables, and lots of specialty items. I actually found a huge bar of chocolate for $72. You can't make this stuff up! Before going, I had heard all about the egregious prices at Eataly, but I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of items that were in my price range. There were carbonated drinks imported from Italy that were $2. There was also reasonably priced chocolate (not just the $72 variety). In that way, there seemed to be something for everyone. I would never make a habit of shopping regularly here because it is not in my budget to buy milk for $7.50 a gallon. We also surveyed the kitchen utensils for sale and they were very overpriced. $17 for measuring spoons? $30 for a cork? You've got to be kidding me. We also took a look at all of the food offerings downstairs, which were relatively cheap: panini bar, cafe, nutella, pastry, gelato.<br><br>We headed upstairs next, where we oohed and ahhed over the fresh seafood, meat, and the pricier restaurants. I admired the Ernest Hemingway quotes on the walls and the fact Eataly is dedicated to the great writer himself. The English major in me was pleased. We followed the aroma of the foccacia and when I saw we could order a piece for UNDER $3, I was sold. It was fresh out of the oven, so the cheese was hot. The flavor was excellent and I could tell the ingredients were of high quality. There was enough for my boyfriend and I to share--yum! The rest of the floor was whole sections dedicated to olive oil and dry pasta, so we headed back downstairs. <br><br>We enjoyed a panini that also had high quality ingredients and delicious bread. However, I was disappointed that the insides of the panini were really cold while the bread was warm. That first bite was a let-down! I felt that, even though the panini was good (and would have been moreso if it had been warmed up properly) that it was not worth the $10 I spent for it. I've had mouth-watering sandwiches in Chicago for half the price. We ordered the $6 mini trio for dessert from the pastry station, which was absolutely divine. Sponge cake layered with dark, white, and milk bavarian cream. With some kind of fancy solid chocolate on top. <br><br>In the end, I think Eataly can be what you want it to be. I sampled a lot with notably high quality ingredients and it cost me less than $20. I could have tried different things and I would have felt ripped off. I would probably not go out of my way to come back here, but I'll probably be back.

I've been sitting on this review for over a week trying to decide how I wanted to approach this write up. My instinct is a 3 star overall rating, but there are parts that deserve 4 stars. I believe in responsible yelping and I'm not going to bash a business simply because I'm not the target audience. Meaning, I'm a broke ass grad student right now and yes, Eataly has chocolate for $72, balsamic vinegar for $288, and wine for $1000. But they also have chocolate for $3,balsamic for $8.00, and wine for $15. There is indeed an abundance of more expensive items than the \"affordable\" items, but accept you just might not be their target and you'll probably have a better time. <br><br>Consider its location - a block off the Magnificent Mile. How many locals like to \"shop\" on the Mile? We figure out the places we need to frequent, get in, get out. I've decided to approach Eataly in a similar fashion. Most of it is not designed with my, ahem, current income in mind, but there are options there, you just need to know where to look so you can get in, and get out. <br><br>Let's start with the coffee. If you want a European coffee experience, then you are going to pay for it in Eataly. It's good. Damn good. But you will pay over $5 for a thimble. Accept it or grab coffee before you enter the mega complex. If you are in search of gelato, then you can definitely find some at a reasonable price here. If you want some 18-24 month aged prosciutto (yum), then know where to look because you can buy a small package and a San Pellegrino for a delicious $7 snack. The fresh made paninis and deliciously topped focaccia can also be had for $3-$10. Gelato, prosciutto, chocolate, focaccia, beer and wine - come on, it's not all bad!<br><br>In my opinion, the most aesthetically pleasing spot in Eataly is Birreria. I mean, wow, thanks to the 360 degree glass walls the outdoor and indoor views are pleasing! It's a cool spot. And when I go back, I probably will just head upstairs and hang out here. <br><br>I would suggest going there to explore the whole place and find what fits your lifestyle. It's not as big as some of the pictures make it seem. I found it a little anticlimactic, but it's still substantial. While I was able to find a decent price range on most items, the kitchen accoutrements and cheeses all seem to be overpriced, with no wiggle range. <br><br>If you're making an Italian dinner, they have absolutely everything you can imagine to make the meal mind blowing. It would make a great first date spot - coffee, wine, plenty of activity in case your date is a snoozefest. I would take the extended fam there, but most likely have to endure the lecture on overpriced city living. Again. If I worked in the area I would take out-of-town clients there to entertain them and get them snockered. And if I have an afternoon of singleness, which I always enjoy, it's a decent place to chill out and people watch. <br><br>All in all, it's A-ok.

My friend and I ate at La Pizza La Pasta. There were many good pizza choices that I had a hard time deciding, so I ended up with the Salucitta (sp) which consist of spicy italian sausage, mushrooms, cheese, and spinach. It was really good...greasy but good. My friend ordered one of their pasta dishes and that was really good. It look like it had beef stew chunks.<br><br>Our waiter was nice - we were seated right away so we didn't have to wait on a Saturday evening at 6pm. I guess you go early with a smaller party and get seated instantly.<br><br>We walked around some more to check out all the other restaurants. We're going to try the fish/seafood place and the regular italian place next time. Lots of opportunities. After dinner we went downstairs and each one of us ordered a gelato. I ordered a medium size which consist of two flavors - tiramisu and the fruity berry sorbet. Tiramisu was okay, the sorbet was good. I wanted the pistachio flavor but it was only available in soft serve. My friend ordered their chocolate gelato.

By 3:15pm the line was already wrapping around the building as the masses (and I) gathered for the public unveiling of the latest and greatest addition to the Batali-Bastianich food empire. Luckily for us, cups of rich hot chocolate were brought out for us as we waited...a delicious peek at what was in store for us inside!<br><br>As the doors opened promptly at 4pm and we all filed in, I couldn't help but feel like a kid walking into Disneyland. Yes, I'd definitely consider Eataly to be a food lover's (especially and Italian  food lover's) amusement park! Two beautiful, open floors of all the Italian food and wine goodies you can think of...and more!<br><br>The first floor is filled with your more standard grocery items like produce along with the sweets ( Gelato bar! Nutella Corner!) and the fabulous Caffe Lavazza for a quick caffeine fix. Obviously a lot of great stuff going on here on the 1st floor, but for me the 2nd floor is where it's at! As we attempted to take in all the wonderful sights and smells around us, we caught sight of one of the wine bars and decided our experience touring Eataly would be much more fun with a glass of wine in hand.<br><br>Now that we had our wine we were ready to explore! Every step we took we found something new and exciting, I don't know that I've ever seen so many great things under one roof! Not only do they have beer and wine to go, they also have a craft beer bar with great beers to sample on site from local breweries like Revolution, Three Floyds, and Half Acre, as well as Dogfish Head in Delaware and two Italian breweries, Birra del Borgo and Baladin. They also MAKE their own beer here in collaboration with Birra del Borgo, Dogfish Head, and Baladin...pretty awesome!<br><br>We continued on and followed our noses to some of their amazing food counters. They have the Rosticceria where you can buy whole roasted chickens, the Salumi and Formaggi bar where you will find cured meats and aged cheese, Il Frito where the fried foods reside, a housemade Mozzarella bar, a butcher, a fishmonger, a fresh pasta counter, a bakery, a pizzeria, and several different spots where you can pull up a seat and grab a more formal bite to eat. As we roamed I snapped pictures with my camera and my iPhone and somewhere between the fishmonger and the fresh pasta counter my phone was plucked from my pocket, never to be seen again. The only negative experience here at Eataly but definitely a lesson learned...keep your valuables close and your iPhone closer!<br><br>After the iPhone incident it was definitely time for more wine so we found an opening at one of the beautiful marble-topped tables and placed and order for wine and a few bites. We sampled the crudo, prosciutto, and housemade mozzarella and everything was delicious!<br><br>After our quick snack we continued to explore the rest of the floor. I ordered a slice of the Sweet Sausage and Bell Pepper Foccacia to-go along with a couple of chocolate chip cookies and both were AH-mazing! Along with all the fresh food they also have a wide variety of dry pastas and sauces, olive oils, and other fun items that make for the perfect gift basket! If that wasn't enough they even have a BEAUTY section! Complete with Davines products!

The place suffers from a true \"dis-feng shui\", with the narrow traffic pattern wrapping around the two escalators that slice the two-story interior in half - dodge the lines for the bathrooms and jump in, 'cause once you've committed to the \"flow\", you're in for a ride. <br><br>(This review will be for the two places we stopped at during our first visit, La Carne, and the beer heaven known as Birreria.)<br><br>At least for now, La Carne appears to be Eataly's best-kept secret, tucked away and far removed from the long lines that cue up for the other restaurants on the second floor. Featuring meats from \"independent family farms\", the tight menu of offerings might leave a true carnivore a tad disappointed, but the modern Italian preparations of their items will leave you feeling fulfilled - just have a seat and let the experience take over.<br><br>We were seated at the bar, overlooking the well olive-oiled crew in the kitchen, and offering a panoramic view of North Wabash Ave. Our server, Tim, greeted us warmly and walked us through the tight, well-constructed menu, offering some spot-on suggestions for food and drink.<br><br>The wine list is about what you'd think; somewhat pricey, all Italian, but of the \"dartboard variety\" - you simply can't pick a bad bottle to highlight your experience. While a couple of the wines-by-the-glass start at $9, there's a huge leap up to the rest of the offerings ranging from $12 to $30+ a glass, although the heavy pours in the tall glasses were a treat. I had the Vespa Rosso 2010 ($19), a blend of 50% Merlot, 30% Refosco, 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc, and the wife had the Valpolicella Ripasso 2011 for $11. Both were perfect reds for the antipasti Tim suggested.<br><br>We started off with the Carpaccio di Barbabietola ($11), which is sliced beets, blood orange vinaigrette, huge strips of parmigiano reggiano with thin ribbons of fat-back lardo. Beets are kind of a new thing for me, and I certainly enjoyed these paper-thin shavings, piled high with the parm' and peppery greens. We also ordered a side of roasted brussels sprouts, just to keep it healthy...they were pan-seared with a large portion of diced bacon (ok, so much for healthy). We followed that with the Carne Cruda, a tartare or Piemontese beef (a northwestern Italian breed of cows now being raised in Nebraska) sprinkled with olive oil and coarse sea salt, served with grilled bread. Probably the best tartare we've ever enjoyed - buttery, melt-in-your-mouth, \"meaty\" and a decent portion at only $15.<br><br>Other offerings included pig trotters with chick peas, seared calves liver with onion and polenta, a beautiful grilled pork loin, and an amazing looking skirt steak with charred flowering plant called an allium. <br><br>Service was rocket-fast at 11:45am when we sat down on the Monday before Christmas, but the place really picked up speed as the lunch hour kicked off.<br><br>After our starters at La Carne, we wandered into Birreria, Eataly's beer-centric brew-pub & restaurant that's a true homage to everything hoppy and crafted. We sampled a couple of beers, including the Italian Thyme Pale Ale, brewed mere feet away from our table, but opted for a couple of Teo Musso's Baladin beers from Torino, a small Italian brewery known for its use of herbs, spices and rare grains. The hoppy draft goodness was served in \"tekus\", the \"world's first universal beer glass\" - certainly not your old man's frosty mug...<br><br>...nor your corner brew-pub's food offerings; the Polpo Fritto -fried octopus, with balsamic glaze- was probably the best thing we ate all day. The $14 plate featured a huge(!) portion of super-tender octopus, lightly fried and dressed in a drizzling of balsamic. I can't think of a better beer-sampling mix of sweet, salty, fried and meaty. Other offerings from the bar menu featured a cheese plate and a meat tray, both $12, and a fried shiitake mushroom and sage plate for $12. You can also order sandwiches from the nearby deli, including the prime rib panini for $14.<br><br>All-in-all, if you enjoy food porn, knocking elbows with fanatic foodies, and oogling over rows of meat-packed refrigerator cases and shelves of pastas, this place is your next \"meal & mosey\" mecca.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I went to Eataly with my sister this past Friday for lunch.

That'd be a crime, but you can do it.<br><br>Now, you have the grocery part of Eataly, and then several distinct restaurants, and the middle plaza area.<br><br>Ok, Eataly puts zero effort into explaining how this all works, which is why I had to drop it to just an average rating. If you want to go get pizza but your friend wants to go to the vegetarian restaurant, you're going to have to choose one or the other. Even though you can physically stand and see all the other restaurants, you're confined to the one you're seated in. Also, if you go to the beer area (which I really love and would highly recommend), you can only order off the bar menu and not even bring in frood from one of the other spots.<br><br>The exception is La Piazza, or the middle area, which is also not described at all. From the center area on the second floor, you can order from four or five of the smaller restaurants surrounding it, and while at one of those smaller places you can get stuff from the other smaller ones, but not the larger ones (veggie, fish, meat, pasta/pizza). The first time I came here with my girlfriend, we had no idea how seating worked and what we could order from where. Even asking the employees, it was hard to get a straight answer. Would a little signage kill the decor?<br><br>Once you do know how to navigate Eataly, it's a wonderful place with great drinks and food. Even though a lot of it's pricey, you can fill up on some tasty focaccia for less than $5.

Eataly has a great wine selection including, drum roll please,  a very impressive bottle of barolo wine for under $70.  The barolo is available by the glass for $19 at the eateries, piazza, and bar areas. It really is more affordable to buy the bottle. I am also a big fan of the antipasti offerings and the Nutella bar.<br><br>I am really disappointed, however, with Eataly's lack of dining options for gluten intolerant/ allergic individuals. I ate at la pasta/ la pizza eatery with some friends during opening week. The waitress informed me that Eataly did not offer any gluten free pasta or pizza alternatives. I also couldn't order a fish or veggie options from the other eateries. Sad to say I ended eating an expensive Insalata  di Romana and a piece of salumi. The salad consists of Italian escarole, shaved asparagus, fennel, braised\\rchickpeas, pickled onions, cacio\\rdi roma and red wine VINAIGRETTE. I saw no escarole or shaved asparagus. My salad looked like it consisted of iceberg lettuce, fresh chickpeas, two tiny pieces of pickled onions, and a lot cheese. If not for the Nutella bar, I would have gone home hungry.<br><br>I do have two complaints regarding the Nutella bar. The pictures are deceiving. The Nutella bar is not huge. It is the size of a small kiosk or food stand in Union Station or suburban mall. The brioche with Nutella was tasty but many of the other items are premade baked goods with some Nutella topping. Eataly does offer made to order crepes but the crepe maker is super slow.<br><br>Food service is lacking throughout Eataly. We had a 30 minute wait for a table so we decided to order some antipasti in la piazza. We informed the waitress before putting in our order that we were waiting to be called for lunch at the pizza/pasta eatery. As we are waiting for our antipasti, the hostess from the pizza/ pasta eatery called us to tell us our table was ready. We  flagged down la piazza waitress only for her to tell us that we could not go eat lunch until we ate our antipasti. No food orders from the piazza are allowed in the eateries. We asked if  we could speak to a supervisor to cancel the antipasti order. The waitress then admits that she never entered our antipasti order. The supervisor stepped in and took care of the situation before I ripped the waitress a new one. <br><br>I hope to give Eataly another try in a few months. I would like to eat at the pesce eatery.

All is available through an array of stands, booths, kitchens and restaurants. Eataly in Chicago has over 60,000 square feet of Italian delicacy. This gives you all the type of foods, from pasta, to pizza, to cured meats, to cheeses, to fishes, to greens, without of course sparing the wines or the deserts. <br><br>The food is of good quality, but you have a quick feeling of fast executed dishes.

We ate at the pizzeria one day and at the place with fried food the next and had dessert and coffee. There were stand-outs and not so stand-outs. <br><br>Surprisingly the pizza was not a stand out dish. This saddened me. The sausage was underseasoned and the crust a little too soggy towards the middle. A side note here on soggy crusts...This is not necessarily a fail. Take, for example, a flammkuchen or tarte flambe from Alsace. It is a simple \"pizza\" with a very thin crust covered in creme fraiche, lardons, and gruyere that come fresh from the oven crispy on the outside with more of a crepe-like texture towards the inside. It works with the creme fraiche and no one would ever attempt to pick it up and fold and eat, as one might do with a pizza.<br><br>The Eataly pizza did not have the pleasant sogginess of the Alsatian tarte, but rather the undercooked doughy taste resulting from a poorly heated oven or watery sauce.<br><br>The wine, however, was delicious.They make an effort have wines curated at each location specific to the food. Both times I had wine, it was delicious.<br><br>The beef carpaccio at meal #2 was a stand out dish. The beef was so flavorful. The arugula was fresh and peppery. We also ordered the shrimp that came lightly dusted in cornmeal and with a wonderful fresh shrimp taste I hadn't had in a long time. It could have well been frozen shrimp as I expect in the midwest, but if it was, it was of the highest quality. The rose wine was perfect with it. We also had the arancini which is something I habitually avoid because a fried ball of rice just doesn't excite me much. These were good, with a fragrant taste of  saffron - not fake saffron. Now - for these 3 dishes plus 2 glasses of wine, we paid over $60 before tip.<br><br>I am a big fan of panna cotta. The last good panna cotta I had was at an Italian restaurant in Dublin, Ireland. And that remains the case. The panna cotta at Eataly could have been called anything; layered Jell-O pudding, pre-fab trifle, but it didn't have the quality or taste of panna cotta.  Dammit!  Panna cotta at its best is simple, delicately sweet, a fresh vanilla cream held together with just a little bit of gelatin. the addition of tart macerated berries or a coulis just sets it off nicely. Eataly! You don't have to shove chocolate ganache into everything! I was robbed. And, incidentally, the texture and color of what was supposed to be panna cotta in the thing was way off, a little grainy, too yellow.<br><br>I would have bought more things at the grocery store part. There is an impressive selection of dried pastas. I could only manage to squeeze a few things into our  suitcases but would have bought more had I the room.<br><br>So - pricey, somewhat spotty in terms of prepared food, definitely a place you can find some delicious things.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I love this place.

There are separate stands for everything italian including panini, nutella type foods, gelato, espresso, beer, beef, fish, pizza, pasta, veggies, wine, rotisserie, and bread. This is quite confusing and I would recommend grabbing a map at the front desk before you journey off. There is no divider between restaurants/cafe. Some you get a table others you just stand at a communal table and eat. We ended up trying the panini and rosticceria. The francesca panini was classic italian with fresh bread and slice of ham with cheese that were quite filling. Priced at 8+ dollars. The rotisseries rotates fresh carved sandwich. On our day it was a pancetta which was cooked and seasoned perfectly albiet for a large quite pricy at 12-14 dollars. Trying to find a spot is a battle of moving around a packed place. The grocery store portion is mixed around the restaurant and almost seems like a after thought. You can see from other pictures the prices are through the roof and only if you are trying something unique could you afford to shop here.

We have tried the flat bread in the past too and have loved the different choices and flavors. <br><br>Today we decided to try the pizzas, so we ordered the Fungi. Since there was a 15-min wait for a table, we ordered it to-go and took it two tables over to the bread section (where we could stand and eat). The pizza crust was uneven - thick on the outer edge and paper thin in the middle, making it very difficult to eat. There was too much tomato sauce on the pizza so it had gotten soggy in the middle - the flavor was off too, needed more seasoning, salt, etc. Super disappointed with the pizza but willing to go back and try other entrees like pasta, etc.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This place is such a great concept and there's something here for everyone.

Walked by Eatly daily and finally stopped in this weekend. It was wonderful - we grabbed some ravioli and wine.

We will for sure be back. <br><br>Also I must mention the Nutella stand heaven!!!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This place deserves four stars. It is truly an amazingly unique dining/market experience. I experienced Eataly on a Saturday night. When I first walked in it was and still is a very intimidating atmosphere: people everywhere, food stands, standing tables, seated tables, all surrounding you with no real sense of order. My date and I were so lost that we had to ask a slew of questions to a nearby host. However, once we got some help and settled in it became easier to navigate. <br><br>We ordered a pizza for pickup at the pizza parlor. While waiting for the pizza to finish, we browsed the rest of the second floor. It was very overwhelming but fascinating nonetheless. Fully stocked fridges with take-away meats, a deli and prepared foods section, fresh seafood, produce, cheese sections, as well as wine bars and sit-down, full menu and service dining. It is a market as much as it is a restaurant. Everything is marked telling you what part of Italy the various foods and ingredients come from. After about 15 minutes we returned to grab our pesto and prosciutto pizza (18.75). It was good but i expected better. Nothing special. I was slightly disappointed by the bite-sized crumbles of prosciutto rather than deli style slices like I was expecting. <br><br>After the pizza, we grabbed the cheapest bottle of red-wine ($35) and continued to the casual high-top bar area (full service, but limited menu) where we ordered the combo platter of 5 different types of cured meats, as well as 5 different cheeses ($22). This was phenomenal and highly recommended. Prosciuttos, mortadella, salami, parmesan, ricotta from what i remember. The platter comes with bread, olive oil, honey and two types of jam. Definitely the highlight. <br><br>After we paid our bill, we went downstairs to the kitchen goods and sweets department. Banana Nutella crepe. Get it. Very good.<br><br>Overall, its a truly unique and impressive place. However, confusing and overwhelming. Ask a hostess or other employee any questions you have if confused. I will be back to experience more.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I love Mario Batali, and I love fancy food emporiums, so I kind of thought Eataly would be more of a home run for me. My husband and I were staying nearby, so we went twice, once just to browse while exploring downtown, and once to eat a late lunch. I thought it was very fun to browse, but that the dining fell short of expectations.<br><br>Eataly is huge and beautiful, a massive supermarket space filled with high-end groceries, kitchen supplies, cookbooks, wine, and well over a dozen places to eat. The produce is gorgeous, and the retail goods displayed to top advantage. The first floor looks like a Sur La Table with a market, coffee stand, a bakery, and gelateria thrown in. The prices are probably not the most competitive, but the selection is curated for quality. You can spend a lot of money on dry pasta alone.<br><br>The upstairs is heavier on the eateries, with several themed dining counters and some restaurant space with table seating for pizza and pasta, maybe a couple of the other entree-heavy spots. We made a couple stops, first putting our name down for La Pasta and then sitting at La Piazza for snacks, as there was a long wait for both the pasta and our friend, who was coming from work across town.<br><br>Some of the counters were full, but La Piazza was easy to access, as it encompassed four separate eateries, with the same menu available at each. We were able to sit at La Mozzarella without a wait. Service was spotty, pretty inattentive considering we were sitting right there the whole time, but not unfriendly. We shared the mozzarella with prosciutto di San Daniele and a half dozen oysters. This was all fantastic. The mozzarella was creamy, rich, and supple; the prosciutto salty with a silky, easy-to-tear texture. The plate came drizzled with olive oil, which only made things better. The oysters were fresh and tasty. We had two each of the French Kiss, the Montauk Pearl, and the Miyagi. Our Piazza foray also earned us some nice crusty bread with olive oil.<br><br>I was most excited for La Pasta, as I had never met a Batali pasta I didn't love. We were a party of three, and we got a cozy little table in this pasta zone. The restaurant was full service, if very informal. Our waitress was good, though the thing I remember most is that she repeated a line when she was explaining the restaurant concept (I believe she described the texture of the pizza, then described it again verbatim), which was funny and robotic. This added to what I was beginning to recognize as a chain restaurant feel that pervaded Eataly. We went in late July, and the whole place featured this weird Ernest Hemingway tie-in, because Hemingway went to Italy?<br><br>I had the Ernest Hemingway tie-in pasta because it sounded great and looked delicious on a plate at a nearby table. It was a squid ink tagliatelle with soft-shell crab, cherry tomatoes, garlic, and chives. It cost $22, and it was bland, bland, bland. The pasta itself was cooked a good al dente and had some of that briny squid ink flavor, but it came in this mild tomato broth with just a tiny bit of garlic. The crab was okay, also underseasoned. I can appreciate a plate of pasta with subtle, delicate flavors, but this was not well done. Never trust Hemingway. My husband had the quadrati with spinach and ricotta, square ravioli topped with parmigiano reggiano, pistachio, lemon, and butter. This was not bad, but it was unsauced, with very little butter. I think this is a pretentious thing? But this pasta would've been much better with some brown butter sauce. Our friend had the tagliatelle with braised short rib ragu, and this was fine, but also miraculously on the bland side. I've never had this problem with Batali pastas before. Are the cooks at this Eataly just spartan with the seasonings?<br><br>Long story short, Eataly is a cool place with a lot of things going for it, but I'd skip the pasta, which should otherwise be a top attraction. We spent too much money for a casual lunch, and the pastas were just not worthwhile.

Go here now.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "An Italian food casino that aspires to be Monte Carlo but comes off more as the old Vegas strip. <br><br>Eataly to me has a bit of an identity crisis. On the one hand they want to offer very high quality items on par (in both quality and price) with classic gourmand Italian restaurants. On the other, they must cater to the masses, in particular the tourist masses, who are either too inconvenienced or too ignorant to seek a more intimate setting for top notch Italian food (La Scarola, Sapori Trattoria, and Coco Pazzo are a few of many that come to mind).<br><br>Fair enough Eataly. If you can prosper off the masses and do so by even incrementally expanding their horizons regarding Italian food, you are already helping out the Michigan Ave corridor far more than the ESPN Zone (former tenants) ever could.  <br><br>And it may be true that many tourists find the loud noise, confusing layout that resembles a kiosk-laiden mall food court, and inability of any dining party to consume pasta, fish, and non-fish meat at one table as proof of your commitment to honoring the diversity of regional fine Italian dishes that many Americans (tourist or otherwise) may fail to grasp if in their home town Italian = Olive Garden.    <br><br>Despite the layout, unlike OG, I believe nearly all the food was quite good. They also have some high-quality meats, cheeses, pastas, oils, and vinegars that are not available at traditional grocers. But this should be expected with the price points these items are offered at, and given the rather pedestrian ambiance (90's hip hop music?) the food alone cannot justify the price when for the same money you can have a much more intimate experience at an Italian bistro that is also (by the way) much more likely to get you laid.<br><br>The security (a sad necessity for any downtown retailer) also adds an element of discomfort, which the layout could be improved to diminish. Unfortunately, Eataly is betting on the overwhelming visual layout of products everywhere to encourage guests to buy early and often upon entrance. Much in the same way even the smallest casinos have um-teen gambling kiosks all vying to separate guests from their money before they can find their way out the way they came in. <br><br>Taking it all in I remarked to a friend how the layout made me feel like Mario Batali must be damn money-hungry to take the concept of a simple yet high quality Italian grocer with some hot food (Bari and L'Appetito come to mind) and turn it into an Italian food Costco. But looking at him, it may be that Chef Batali is just generally hungry all the time. Perhaps in the same way that you shouldn't grocery shop hungry, I'm not sure it's wise to design your restaurant /  high-end grocer hungry either.<br><br>I will definitely return for the vinegars or if someone else is choosing / buying.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Eataly's Customer service is the worst!!
