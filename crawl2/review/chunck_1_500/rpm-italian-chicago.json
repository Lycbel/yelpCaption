See our order and ratings below:<br><br>Fried Olives (10/10): the cheapest and most delicious thing on the menu! I could have ordered 3 more servings. <br><br>Garlic Bread (5/10): our waiter told us this garlic breawas life changing and my life was certainly not changed. Texas Toast was better than this. <br><br>Caesar Salad (6/10): my sister ordered and said it was ok. The croutons are odd and spongy. <br><br>Spincy Squid Ink Pasta (7/10): pretty good dish but the pasta was more rubbery. Not the best seafood pasta we've had. <br><br>Tortelloni with rosemary and cheese (10/10): best dish of the night by far! The pasta sauce was spectacular and the cheese-filled noodles will leave you craving more. <br><br>Eggplant Parm (7/10): it was alright. Not the best I've had. You can find a much better eggplant parm up in Southport at the Argentinian steakhouse. <br><br>Chicken Parm (7/10): my boyfriend is a huge lover of chicken Parm. When I asked how it was he simply responded \"eh, I've had better\". <br><br>That seemed to the theme of the night: \"eh, I've had better\". <br><br>Outside of food, the waitstaff was great, ambiance was nice and relaxing, and cocktails were delicious.

The first time I ate there I thought the food was just so-so. I've been back several times since then (because LEYE points) and have recently just been really impressed. The pastas are solid, the red wine is a-flowing, and the service is excellent. It's still expensive but it's River North so I've come to terms with that. At least you can earn those LEYE points.<br><br>My go-tos are always the truffle garlic bread, some sort of salad (either the shredded Brussels sprouts or Tuscan kale & spinach, both delish, and never overdressed), any of the pastas (recommend the bucatini or butternut squash agnolotti). It's also white truffle season right now so GET SOME. I've also tried on the steak side, the RPM Steak Grigliata which is a hangar and recommended cooked medium rare. Now I love me a medium rare but that night it was definitely more on the rare side so be careful. The bone-in ribeye (medium rare of course) is solid and they slice it up for you. We recently also tried the grilled giant prawns. They are for sure giant, pretty much mini lobsters and are worth it. You get two split in two so really four.<br><br>Of the few times I've actually had any room for dessert, I remember loving the lemon cake, it's light and refreshing and delicious, especially when you're full of pasta and red wine.<br><br>Reservations highly recommended. Even on weekdays. I've been on a Monday and #onaTuesday and it's always packed.

If there had been an emergency and people had to evacuate, we would have been in everyone's way and probably would have been trampled.

I visited the restaurant with my boyfriend and had a pleasant experience. The only awkward menu item was the fritto misto because it was shrimp and calamari in tempura. Tempura just doesn't seem to jive well for me at an Italian restaurant. I would much rather have had those items grilled to fit the theme of the restaurant a little better. My eggplant was delectable and the sauce was not incredibly acidic as sauces at other restaurants often tend to be. <br><br>My boyfriend enjoyed his spaghetti and meatball dinner, although the dessert he received afterwards was pretty disproportionate to his entree. He received a strawberry cheesecake, which is a heavier dessert. You would think that you would get a smaller portion of this, but that was not the case.

I have never been a huge fan but this was one of the best things I've eaten ever. We also had the truffle garlic bread (delicious). I had the potato gnocchi and it was like a play on cacio e pepe. He had the pork and beef ragu and it was delicious. The actual pasta was so good. We had both the budino and the donuts. I would skip the budino and order double donuts.

I was warned ahead of time that they chronically run 15 minutes late and so I made our reservation for 15 minutes earlier than I wanted to eat and this in fact was true- they sat us 15 minutes later than the reservation time! I was greeted, however, instantly by someone offering to check my coat, which was a very nice touch. Once seated, the service was fast and great and the waitress provided tons of suggestions and gave us our time to look at the menu. <br><br>Given the hype I heard about this place being the most amazing Italian food ever, I was a little disappointed. Although the food was good, it was just average Italian food and there wasn't much uniqueness to it, which I was expecting. <br><br>The warm bread is an absolute MUST to start off with. We had the fresh homemade ricotta which was so flavorful and they brought us plenty of extra bread so we could keep eating the ricotta. <br><br>The Roman-Style Artichoke with garlic and lemon aioli is one of the most unique ways I have had artichoke ever. I don't usually enjoy artichoke that much due to flavor and texture, but this is also a must have dish when you come here! <br><br>The pasta's were all fairly basic. There was no big uniqueness to them and I felt like they were pasta's I could make at home and enjoy just as much. <br><br>The dessert was PHENOMENAL. If you like ferrero roche then you must get the hazelnut tartufo. It tastes exactly like a ferrero roche and looks like one too. A little cold on your teeth, but completely worth it. <br><br>I would definitely come back here if someone wanted to come and I think I would try more of the non-pasta dishes as I absolutely loved those!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Came to RPM Italian for Christmas Eve price fix dinner.

Inside the restaurant was dimly lit to give a high end feel, and judging from the food we were about to consume, I would say that it's most appropriate.<br><br>For the best variety of plates, definitely go family style. My group ordered a couple of starters and pastas to split amongst the table. Here were our highlights:<br><br>- Prosciutto ($15) was excellent! A plate contains about ten cuts of meat, nicely laid out in a flower shape ready to be served.<br><br>- Beef Tartare over toasted bread was amazing. It was probably some of the best tartare I've had in a while. A plate comes with three servings and you can add additional servings if desired.<br><br>- Lobster Ravioli ($18) was my favorite pasta dish that we ordered. Six medium-sized green ravioli baked with seafood and garnished with mint leaves.<br><br>- Steak Grigliata ($29) was the most filling option that we had- nice cuts of meat that made an amazing compliment to the already delicious pastas.<br><br>Pasta plates are definitely share-friendly although a bit on the smaller side. Our waitress recommended that we order 2 plates per person in our group in order to be content with the meal. Either way, RPM provides a fantastic tasting of Italian flavors that rivals a lot of other spots I've been to.

The bread had a crust but it was all perfectly soft, not too crunchy at all. The meatballs had a nice herby flavor, and the sauce complemented it so well. The eggplant parm didn't even remind me of eggplant. The dish just flowed together so well that the cheese masked the eggplant's texture. The pasta -- you could tell it was homemade. It was soft but didn't fall apart. The short rib melts in your mouth. <br><br>As if that wasn't enough, our service was phenomenal. Dre was one of the highlights of our experience.

You'd think for a restaurant from the same family as a steakhouse (RPM Steak), RPM Italian would at least have a DECENT steak. But, sadly, it seems grilling techniques aren't up to par here. So, let's break down why this steak was terrible:<br><br>1) The crust on the steak was.... very crusty; it took up a majority of the mouth-feel, and I definitely don't enjoy when my steak is more crunchy than succulent. For a strip-length steak, even the way they diagonally slice it to increase the meat to crust ratio wasn't enough to salvage how much time we ended up chewing the crust.<br><br>2) The steak was cooked unevenly. We ordered the steak medium-rare, and it came out medium-rare on two pieces. Due to the length and the uneven thickness of the steak, we discovered after each having about two pieces of the thicker end each, that the steak was well-done the rest of the way through, making it tough and chewy. It just wasn't really palatable, especially when combined with the already crispy crusting.<br><br>3) The steak was over-seasoned; more than once, we both experienced biting into larger particles of salt that completely overwhelmed our taste buds. We both prefer to taste some of the natural flavours of our steak, but the seasoning was a bit too heavy-handed for us. Having to chew the well-done steak for an extended period of time made it all the worse, as well.<br><br>We'd already consumed a decent portion of the steak when we discovered the cook of the steak, so we didn't feel comfortable sending it back, but beware! You definitely want to steer clear away from this steak. For $30, we weren't expecting to be wowed with an amazing steak, but at least it should be cooked to order, and seasoned appropriately.  <br><br>For the pasta, it's a maybe. For the steak, we know we can definitely make better at home, for cheaper. We both really wanted to give this three stars, just for the service and for the other two dishes we ordered. However, the steak left us both feeling disappointed and a little cheated.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0Sa4wdSOlmhmzSg4MUYRfA/348s.jpg", "caption": "Someone please tell me how this steak is considered medium-rare?!"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FRkbMMOxbZcqC_B-dIoJdA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Spaghetti and Meatballs"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ngILfb3o7UvA3ugBkue-TA/168s.jpg", "caption": "RPM Steak Grigliata"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Came here for a gf's bday dinner and we all came away happily satisfied!

I had to try RPM Italian, because I've always envisioned mama Depandi's food being so deliciously Italian! <br>So, the ambiance was modern, dim lighting, a little loud, and the tables were too close to each other to where I could hear the person's conversation sitting next to me in full detail. <br>So the way this is set up is you order a few different plates (portion sizes are small) and you share with the people at your table or you just get multiple items to fill you up. I was annoyed with this concept because when it comes to good food, I just don't want to share... I want my own meal (sorry, not sorry)...and then your forced to buy an appetizer, 2 different pastas, two different meats. So the pastas really don't come with a protein (it may have pieces of bacon or what not), you have to purchase an order of meat to have with the pasta..which obviously is more money. So, some may like this concept and some may not. Very similar to a tapas bar. They also have few full portion size items...like a steak. <br>So, I ordered the carbonara (it had a sunny side up egg on my pasta that the server mixes right in front of you)...that was delicious!!! I will tell you in hindsight that the pasta was in a small bowl and portioned perfectly for one person ... if I were verrrrry hungry, I'd want more! However, I also got the 4 grilled prawns for $29 to eat alongside my pasta. The prawns were still in its shell, and I was quite disappointed about this because I had to use my fingers to remove the shell. I was tugging and pulling and making a mess. I wish the chef would have done this for me. Thank God, I was not a first date kinda thing but with my husband. Still it was not a pretty sight! The prawns were good, a little dry...but good. So that along with the pasta was filling. For dessert, I had the tartufo....it has the chocolate hazelnut shell (it's a big ball) with milk chocolate ice cream inside and then with dark chocolate right at the core. That was so delicious!!! It's a good size for two people, maybe just one if you really love desserts. <br>This is a definite must try restaurant, wish I could have given it more stars but just didn't like the concept.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Loved our experience here!

I would plan to share though because it is a good portion and I would be very sick of zucchini if I ate it all. I'm not a big fan of zucchini but the texture, seasoning, and breading made it very delicious! It practically melts in your mouth when you eat it. Again, I was surprised that I really enjoyed this dish. <br><br>I had the Pappardelle Bolognese. Which was basically short rib, tomato sauce, and noodles. I thought the serving size was fair but you will definitely not be stuffed. I really enjoyed the flavors of this dish and would order it again. <br><br>Some things on their menu are pricey but you can get away with other dishes that are $16 for a main meal.

During my second visit, I had the zucchini fritti, and was very pleased.  Both the fried zucchini, and herb dipping sauce paired well together.  <br><br>The squid ink pasta and potato gnocchi were both hits for me.  The portions for both were the perfect size, and had great flavors.  I've never had dessert here, but I would like to try their gelato sometime.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zz2-pZC3Cb-EP8fWswqtaQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "Potato gnocchi"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "What can I say?

She's a reality TV fan and this location is own by Bill and Giuliana Rancic of Apprentice and E TV game. <br><br>After checking out the menu online , it seemed like a perfect option . The only problem was for the 4 nights we would be in Chicago, there was no availability on open table for any night we would be there!!!<br><br>I kept checking and finally a spot opened up for Thursday night at 545... Perfect. And that was only the beginning. We  were led to a large circular leather banquette for just the two of us our backs to the bar overlooking all the other tables...Perfect.<br><br>We ordered two lemon drop martinis as their drink menu didn't really hit us that night. Made to perfection. Our waiter was excellent, attentive but letting us set the pace . <br><br>After enjoying our martinis in our comfy booth, we ordered apps then our entrees. It's a great menu with a variety of options. You could spend a lot ( we did) or not by ordering a small plate pasta and salad as our neighbors did. <br><br>By husband ordered the Caesar Wedge Salad made with Romaine \" wedges\" while I had the arancine and we shared Zucchini Fritta, which I thought were the stuffed zucchini blossoms I had seen in a review. It wasn't but were paper thin slices of zucchini coated in a light Panko , barely fried but crisp and delish. They were served with a tasty dipping sauce. The Caesar wedge was also delicious. The arancine were just ok... I've had better. <br><br>For dinner,  my husband ordered the veal chop and I had the Eggplant Parm. The veal chop was cooked and seasoned to perfection; he chose a side of garlic mashed which was equally good. My eggplant was superb, frankly the best I've ever had including my own. <br><br>We had to pass on dessert as we both were stuffed.<br><br>Our return 2 days later was equally as good. We arrived about 530 on a Saturday. The bar and any high top around it are open seating. Def give it a try if you can't get reservations. Our waiter from the prior night stopped by our table to say hello and to ask what we were ordering. Nice touch. <br><br>This time around my husband ordered the Carbonara And the wedge again while I ordered the actual stuffed zucchini flowers ( a special) and eggplant again! All were excellent though the stuffed zucchini flowers were not as good as I expected. <br><br>This time we saved room for dessert..,, a huge hazelnut bombe , the homemade version of a Ferraro Roche chocolate.

The pastas stole the show, especially the Burrata Tortellini...I could have licked the bowl!<br><br>Entrees: these were ordered individually, and I had the RPM Steak Grigliata which is like a hanger steak.  The others in my party had the Atlantic Swordfish which I was told cooked perfectly and Pork Arrosti which was so tender that you can cut it with a spoon.  We also ordered the Charred Cauliflower - I have no idea what they cook it in, but it's caramelized and soooo delicious.  Never thought I would crave cauliflower.<br><br>Desserts: We ordered 2 desserts to share: Sweet Burrata Gelato (yes, that's right) with Tomato-Caramel Syrup,Genovese Basil...best gelato ever - it's a sweet play on a caprese salad...and Vanilla Panna Cotta with Frutti Di Bosco...good, but definitely took a backseat to the gelato.<br><br>After the amazing meal that we had, we are definitely planning on coming back.  The restaurant itself has just the right amount of modern and upscale feel without sacrificing the comfort of an Italian restaurant.  Really loved our experience.<br><br>Valet was $15, and we did have a snafu with the valet company, but Gillian from RPM got in contact with them and everything was resolved without too much hassle.  Thanks for your commitment to making this restaurant great!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/v75nkPkImz77309jCaYqXw/348s.jpg", "caption": "Appetizers!"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RzRmxQL-PxvNfvZOKY94Lw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Pastas and Salad!"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1y_rYDLROI5vRw8Ozs-LTA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Entrees and Side!"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "I have no regrets.  Dinner last night was amazing.  Every.

I'm going to ignore the uselessness of the claim of \"prime\", but the texture was that of sausage and they didn't have much flavor. I don't know what the HELL they fried the arancini in but they had a fishy flavor to them. I don't know if it was intentional or they used the same oil they cook the calamari with, but it was strong. The dates were coyingly sweet and didn't blend well with the scuitto. I'm giving up on ordering them anywhere not called Avec. <br><br>If you're counting that's already over $30 wasted on poor apps.<br><br>For dinner we got the rib eye and a shortrib tortellini special with shaved truffles. Just like at RPM steak the ribeye was aggressively charred. I don't mind char but it really only works when the steak is thick and rich. These steaks were flimsy, dry and under seasoned. Two people ordered them and they both were upset with them. The tortellini I got had only about 7 in total and were just okay, not worth $40. <br><br>And to top it off, the birthday desert was 3 tiny balls of mediocre gelato on tiny waffle cones. I'm not one to complain about free stuff, but considering the mark up on everything I think they can do better than this shit.

The entrance is a bit innocuous, but once you step inside, the restaurant has a very sleek, cosmopolitan feel to it. To me, it almost feels a little overdone, and although our seat (one of the semicircular booths) was very comfortable, the background music and the ambiance definitely lends itself to a bit more of a formal feel...even for lunch. Service overall was pretty good, if a little stiff (again: fairly formal), but our food came out well-timed, letting us enjoy each course and to soak in the atmosphere a little. There's a fairly solid drinks menu (although the beers are not as plentiful as the craft beer scene would allow for), and my cocktail was very good - just the right balance between fruit and alcohol, with a nice, firm layer of egg white foam on the top.<br><br>On balance, the food here was quite good, and virtually everything we ate I would probably order again without much hesitation. That said, there were little nuances to each dish that I would probably tweak. We shared the beef tartare to start, which was very fragrant given the black truffle that was infused in it. Unlike some Italian beef tartares, which can be a bit dry, this one was plenty moist, and I really enjoyed the crunchy bread it was served on. Surprisingly, the bread isn't just a single slice - it's more like a crisped panini (or, more frankly, a grilled cheese sandwich). It did not clash as much as I thought it would, but the cheese gave it a bit more heft that made the overall dish a bit heavier than I would have preferred. The pasta courses were probably my favorite of the whole meal...I went with the spicy crab served with squid-ink spaghetti...the flavors definitely lean more on the Southeast Asian side versus traditional Italian, but the heat of the pepper with the freshness of the crab meat worked very well with the warmth of the spaghetti (which was cooked very well, too). My wife's short rib bolognese (served with pappardelle) was excellent as well; I really enjoyed the succulence of the short rib, with the only thing working against it being that the sauce had too much liquid - it didn't make the pasta soggy, but it did water down the flavor a tad. For our mains, we both went with seafood, and on balance, both were solid, albeit a little less memorable. My scallops (3 large ones for a course) were solid, with a nice sear on the top. I did enjoy the hazelnut-infused cream, although the sweetness didn't work as well when paired with the creamy mashed potatoes we got as a side, as the buttery nature of that clashed with the slightly sweet and nutty flavor of the scallops. My wife went with the black bass special, which was solid - I enjoyed the crisped skin - but was a little overcooked. Speaking of the potatoes, they were delicious, and I really enjoyed the crunch of the freshly ground black pepper that was mixed in, along with the flavor of the freshly-chopped chives. However, there were chunks of Gorgonzola cheese mixed in, and because it didn't melt in right away, there were a few bites of potatoes I had that were extra-cheesy. I would probably ask for them without it next time.<br><br>The food at RPM is very good overall. It isn't traditional Italian, but it doesn't try to stray too far from the roots and get overly adventurous, and this serves it well. I would come back to sample other dishes from the menu, particularly the appetizers and pastas, and I would probably come back for dinner instead of lunch, where a more crowded dining room would probably give it a more relaxing vibe.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Every time I come to chicago, the one place I am always sure to have a reservation at is RPM Italian.  I always like the elegant but modern vibe it has.

My mother and I came dressed down because of our before/after dinner plans and we felt just as welcomed as the nicely dressed guests. <br><br>We enjoyed the Wood-Roasted Octopus and the Cremini Mushroom pizza as an appetizer. While the octopus was a little on the salty side, we enjoyed both. The pizza was very thin and small... Great size for an appetizer! For dinner, we split the Faroe Island Salmon and the Potato Gnocchi, fantastic! For dessert, we had the Chocolate Torta. <br><br>Overall, I loved our evening here and am looking forward to come back to try more of the menu.

I only got a chance to try the Spicy King Crab pasta and Atlantic Swordfish.<br><br>Both were excellent dishes. In general, I would say the portions for this type of restaurant is on the smaller side. That's just unfortunate. The amount of king crab was proportionate to the amount of squid ink spaghetti you got. The crab meat was fresh and there was no water left at the bottom of the plate after consuming the spaghetti. There was enough spice/kick to the dish. It may be a little strong for some people so beware. The pasta itself was delicious. It was cooked perfectly and didn't taste any flour. The amount of squid ink used was just right. Sometimes some places overdo it with the ink and it leaves a weird aftertaste in your mouth. <br><br>The Atlantic Swordfish was surprisingly moist and flaked off nicely. I thought it would have been a meatier fish and assumed the dish would be on the drier side but they cooked the fish quite nicely. Only issue was that it was over seasoned. Other than that, the fish was cooked perfectly and even got grill marks on it. <br><br>The service at the bar was great. The bartender was very nice and got our drinks and food in a timely fashion.

That makes it difficult to go out to eat at nicer restaurants and dinner time in general is almost impossible with the kid's bedtime.

I had to call the restaurant, which was no big deal. Placed the order and they said it would be ready in 15 minutes. When I strolled in 15 minutes later, the place was packed (it was a Friday night). It was nice to just pay for my food and leave. We ordered the bucatini, the carbonara, garlic bread, and brocollini. I've seen some reviews say the portions were small, but I actually thought they were a normal size serving. The garlic bread was actually too much for the two of us. Both entrees were delicious. The bucatini had a hint of spice. I've carbonara was really delicious with a great sauce. Both pastas were cooked perfectly. The garlic bread was very good, although I wasn't as wowed as I expected to be (it honestly just tasted like normal garlic bread). The brocollini was a surprise hit though. Really, really tasty. Some bites are a little spicy, but oh so delicious. For the two of us, that meal cost us $50. Not bad at all. <br><br>We'd love to go back at some point to actually eat there since there's basically zero ambience in us hiding out in the bathroom so we don't wake the kid while eating.

(If you're a fan of Malbecs/Tempranillos, highly recommend as something a litttttle different but similar palate)<br><br>Appetizers- This is where it went downhill. We started with the big eye tuna bruschetta and the arancini. Frankly, the arancini didn't have much taste. It wasn't worth the calories in the slightest. The bruschetta had a basil pesto which was delicious, but overpowered the tuna to the point of it being pointless to have on the dish. (That being said, if they just wanted to add a bread with that pesto to the menu, I`d probably get that :) ). <br><br>Main Course- We ordered the lamb ragu special which came with burrata on top. Because we ordered this, we didn't get the burrata appetizer, and now I regret that. The burrata was amazing, we should have just doubled up. Anyways, the pasta dish was very good. Cooked slightly al dente, just how I like it. Next, we got the halibut which was cooked very well. No complaints there- I would get it again.

Not salty at all. This would be something I'd order every time I'd come here.<br><br> Prime beef meatballs: This was a nice hearty appetizer. Three healthy sized meatballs. Not overwhelming in size but more than a tiny meatball :p I don't know the name of the dish vehicle it was in LOL but it was a good one, to hold these three meatballs with lots of sauce, bread crumbs and cheese.  The meatballs were VERY moist! The meat was seasoned well.  Not salty at all and a well sauced dish.

This plate was actually sauced. A nice tomato based sauce and a good serving of King Crab. This dish was cooked perfectly and I couldn't stop eating it. <br><br>  <br> Bucatini with lobster: This was my dates dish. He practically murdered it.

I will be forever getting a bombolini if I see it on the menu. We took this to go and I killed it a few hours later. Now if this dessert was crack hours later, I could only imagine it fresh out the kitchen! These also come with a side of a nutella spread. Now I usually HATE nutella, but  this was goooooood.

Ask for a side of the pomodoro sauce as well.<br>Burrata w/ Figs - also soooo freaking good. So good, we asked for more figs...<br><br>Entrees, were great portions, but definitely consider family style and sharing in order to try a bit of everything. <br>- Bucatini w/ Diablo sauce - we were looking for a kick to the sauce and this nailed it. While i'm not a huge fan of the bucatini pasta itself, I really loved the sauce. <br>- Spicy King Crab - this didn't hit spicy on my tastebuds, but the crab was solid. The squid ink seemed a little dry to me, but it was my first time trying this type of pasta - so I could be totally wrong on this. <br>- Eggplant Parmesan - FAVORITE!! This freaking veggie plate stole the show for all of us, even carnivores at the table. It was so gooey hot and crispy. You have to be sure to order this dish and share. It'll be worth your while<br>- Prosciutto Tortellini - another solid dish, really really good flavors and probably the best prosciutto flavors i've had in quite a while.<br><br>For dessert you have to order the hazelnut tartufo.

Maybe another weekday wouldn't be so bad to just walk in.<br><br>Once we sat, we had a really sweet and personable waitress who was able to really articulate the dishes she would recommend and why which I really appreciated. She really had a lot of enthusiasm for where she worked. <br><br>The vibe is like a romantic modern vibe is that makes sense. It feels Intimate even though the aesthetic is modern. <br><br>We ordered cocktails. Mine was a special they had that night which was a cucumber ginger cocktail. It was great but in my opinion overpriced. Probably should have just gotten a bottle of wine! <br><br>The food. Oh man. I gotta tell you, the octopus was our least favorite of what we ate and it was pretty delicious. We started out with the 600 day old prosciutto and while simple, it was SO good! We also had the the octopus as an appetizer as well. For the dinner, we got three pasta dishes (the sizes of the pastas are generally small, which was fine by me because we got to try different kinds.) The dishes were the short rib Bolognese, lobster ravioli and a special pasta they had that night which was a three cheese with shaved truffles on top. All three pastas were amazing and they really put a generous helping of the truffles on the third pasta which I wasn't expecting. My favorite was the lobster ravioli. The sauce it was in was just incredible. Then after that my husband and I split the BRANZINO!!! Get this fish! If you like Chilean sea bass, you will love it. First of all, it's a great portion size and it's a light tasting, but melts in your mouth fish with capers, herbs, olive oil on top served with a side of a house chimichurri they make which brings it all together. It was the perfect dish to go.eith the pastas since it didn't feel heavy. My mom tweeted Giuliana rancic asking what to get here and she highly recommended the branzino. Must get!! <br><br>Now after all this you wouldn't think we had room for dessert. We normally never make it to dessert, but I'm so glad we did because we got one of the best desserts I've had in a long time! It looked exactly like a large Ferrero rocher chocolate ball, except in the middle is hazelnut ice cream. It was amazing!!! I could have easily had another and I'm not one for desserts. <br><br>While I do think this place is one of the pricier Chicago spots, I think it's worth indulging in, if you're looking for a more upscale Italian experience.

If you like any type of Bruschetta like me - get this. <br><br>I had the Spaghetti and Meatball. I usually say it's really hard to mess up a dish like this. But so far in life - I always manage to stick to this dish in any Italian Restaurant. RPM's version is absolutely delicious. The Meatball is done perfectly. The noodles and Meatball absorbed the sauce extremely well. Nom. Just drooling thinking about it.<br><br>My friends (for appetizers) had the Wood Roasted Octopus (I love grilled Octopus!) - get this if you like anything grilled, beef carpaccio - a bit more raw for my liking. But my 2 friends who had it loved it. Safe to say it's a great item. <br><br>For entrees - my friends had the Spicy King Crab (Highly recommend this! I had a bite of it and I could taste the crab in the noodles.

The size of this dessert is awesome. (well, after eating a full course..). The inside tasted amazing. Nom. Tastes jue like a Ferroro Rocher. Imagine those tiny things, but 3x as big and filled with more sweets. <br><br>Tiramisu was also good, but our eyes were stuck on the Hazelnut. I probably *maybe* just skip this and order the winner.

He kept staring at me and my coworker and I asked him to stop and he said he is allowed to look wherever he pleases.

Our reservation was at 8:15pm on Saturday and we were seated promptly when we arrived. When the host took us to our table, I was honestly in disbelief - there are two large bench/booths with tables and chairs on the other side. I've dined at restaurants before with this type of seating arrangement and it's not my favorite however there has been adequate space between the tables. At RPM, the tables were so crammed together to get more people in the restaurant I had to shimmy in sideways to get to the booth (and I'm not a large person) and with a large winter coat, hat, and scarf, I had to put all of this on my lap as the diners next to me (and I'm not exaggerating) were less than a foot from my right and left sides. This experience was awful - not only was I crammed in like a sardine with all of my winter gear (and sweating because I was so hot) on my lap as there was no other place to put it, I couldn't even hear my date across from me but I did hear about the lady next to me and how she just had a baby and it was her first night out and couldn't believe she could fit into the pants she was wearing. I came to dine with my boyfriend - not the ladies next to me.<br><br>To top it off, our waiter was very inattentive after we had told him we wanted to start with waters as we hadn't had a chance to review the drink menu. He literally walked by our table and helped every dining party around us on the large booth/bench until I waived him down and he goes, \"Can I help you with something?\" Um yes, how about taking our order? <br><br>Our food was out extremely fast to the point that it seemed as if I was eating in a fast food restaurant - we were in and out of RPM in less than an hour.<br><br>I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and we were hoping to have another amazing experience like we did previously however this time it fell short, extremely short.

At 5:40 PM, we are finally seated.<br><br>Okay, we get three comped appetizers, and they are horrible. We got the Provolone-Stuffed Peppers, which tasted like tomatoes with hot sauce on them.

She was right, because I got there at 6:05 and every seat around the bar and at the bar area tables was taken. I lucked out that a group of ladies were finishing up and snagged 2 chairs at the end of a community table for myself and a friend. Our server was Aiden and he was one of the best servers I've ever had. I myself was a server in the past and compliments to servers don't come easily from me!

We elected to sit in the bar area (thinking service would be faster to turn more tables). Our \"server\" came over after a lengthy wait and took our drink orders. We also got our appetizer orders in before he left.<br><br>The Shredded Brussels Sprouts Salad came out first. It was definitely tasty with the avocado slices and dressing. I thought the raw Brussels sprouts added a unique crunchiness to the salad.<br><br>Next, the Imported Burrata appetizer arrived. While the cheese itself was tasty, the peaches were a total miss. Many of the slices were unripe and crunchy-- not a pairing one would like with high quality cheese. Even if they theoretically use ripe fruit, the culinary team should consider cooking them in some sort of sauce to add flavor and dimension.<br><br>We had to wait at least 10 minutes after finishing our appetizers to flag down our server and order our main dishes. Multiple staff members walked by and seemingly ignored my eye contact.<br><br>I will say that the main dishes were truly remarkable. The Spaghetti and Meatball dish was divine. The pasta tasted freshly made, and the tomato sauce was vibrant, luscious, and tangy with just the right amount of herbs and sweetness. The meatball was a great blend of different meats, and the smaller portion size was perfect.<br><br>Other members in our party enjoyed the Chicken Parmesan. The breaking was quite different than most Americanized Italian spots. If was light, fluffy, and super crispy on the outside. The chicken was perfectly cooked and still juicy throughout. Also of note was the perfectly melted cheese on top and delicious tomato sauce.<br><br>When we finally flagged down our server (again) for dessert, we went with the Raspberry Gelato and the Boulobini special donuts. <br><br>Wow, the donuts stole the show! They were perfectly fried pillows of heaven. They didn't taste greasy at all, and the sugar was rolled on throughout. The dipping sauces were all excellent-- they were pretty thick, but they melted nicely over the donuts. My favorites were the Nutella (they must have added something to it) and the Lemon Cream Sauce.

I'm not a huge huge fan of Italian food but I've had my fair share of different Italian cuisines (lived in Italy for a bit) and had some decent homemad Italian food before too. We got the 600-day proscuito, the wood roasted octopus, and I got the Spicy King Crab Squid Ink pasta. I would recommend all of the dishes I had. The 600 Day Proscuitto is just fantastic. One dish comes with a lot of proscuitto actually so it was never ending proscuitto for just two of us. I really enjoyed the octopus antipasti. I'm usually not a fan of chickpeas (they came in the dish) but mixing it with the octopus created an explosion of flavor where the octopus has a strong dominant flavor but is lightly muted by the chickpeas so you can go back and eat more octopus. The squid ink pasta with spicy king crab i got was pretty good. I dont have a huge tolerance level for spice and this was good (and in my limit). In parts of Italy, they also serve squid ink pasta but a lot of places simply use squid ink sauce instead of a tomato based one. The ones in Italy don't always have as strong squid flavor, but this one did. It balanced out the heat that came with the dish and the squid flavor adds a dimension of flavor to the entire dish (so it's not just hot and acidic). However, the thing to really talk about is not the savory stuff, but the freaking dessert. He had a Hazelnut Tartufo and that thing was amazing. It wasn't too overpowering as half of the choclate ice cream was dark. Then the tartufo ... is just a giant ferrero rocher. If you like hazelnut, chocolate, and ice cream like any other red blooded human, you'd love this. HIGHLY RECOMMEND<br>Service: 7/10<br> Service was nothing out of the ordinary. There were at times we were looking for our server, but it was a busy night and in the end, we managed to get her attention.<br>Overall: 7/10<br>Additional Notes: This place is a pretty \"classy\" place and does get pretty packed on the weekends.

Took a star off for that. <br><br>Overall the restaurant was okay, it was almost trying too hard to be hip with the dark atmosphere and modern design.

I've had better supermarket garlic bread... <br>2) Zucchini Fritti: Tastes fine and the dip is lovely, but at the end of the day it's pretty much just fried zucchini. <br>3) Mama De Pandi's Buchatini: Many Yelpers seem to like this dish but I thought it was average. Perhaps it is meant to be simple and straightfoward. Texture of the bucatini is very good though. <br><br>For dessert, try the Tartufo. It is decadent and so very good.

Perfect summer cocktail as I settled into my weekend vacay = the peach Bellini.

We wanted to go outside our comfort zone and ordered a few things we've never tried before:<br><br>-Chicken Liver Pâté - I'm admitting this is not my thing. I couldn't get over the thought that I was eating my cat's food. The crispy crustini was piled high. The texture threw me, but that's my own issue, not necessarily that the dish was lacking. At least I can say I tried it.<br><br>-Arancini - amazing! Like fried balls of carby, cheesy heaven. Although I would have loved a smidge more sauce for dipping.<br><br>-Gnocchi al Forno - also a perfect small bite to share and the pairing of sage and Gorgonzola needs to be replicated in my own kitchen since I don't have the luxury of flying to Chicago whenever I crave these flavors.<br><br>All in all it was a great happy hour local and I recommend it if you're in the neighborhood.

Our waiter informed us that their dishes are meant to be as such and encouraged us to order a few dishes to share. To start, we got two glasses of Pinot Grigio ($8) and the Prime Beef Meatballs ($10). The appetizer comes with three meatballs in marinara sauce, topped with parmesan and fresh basil. The meatballs were moist and flavorful. For entrees, I ordered the Sweet Potato Gnocchi ($15). I'm a sucker for gnocchi and will order it wherever I see it on the menu. These were the first time I tried it infused with black truffle, I loved it. The dish looks like a small portion but it is definitely on the heavier side with the sauce. My friend ordered the Spicy King Crab with Squid Ink Spaghetti. We both agreed that we liked her dish better. The dish had a nice kick to it and there was a good amount of king crab. And finally, dessert. The popular choice here (from reading other reviews) seemed to be the Tartufo ($9) which was hazelnut gelato inside a chocolate-hazelnut shell. Omg it was heavenly.

From the outside it just looks like any other place. And inside it is very modern and chic, super clean and trendy.

She was very knowledgeable about he menu, on hand whenever we needed her, friendly and jokable (is that a word?) with our table, and just overall a good person.<br><br>Drinks/Food: We started out with some drinks (beer, of which they don't have a huge selection, wine, pretty extensive list, and cocktails, a good-sized selection) before moving on to some apps. For starters we had the Fresh Homemade Riocta, Ciabatta Toast (very tasty), Butternut Squash Arancini (very tasty!), a Tuscan Kale salad (good, but not large enough for more than one person), and the RPM Caesar Wedge salad (not a \"traditional\" wedge salad). Moving onto the main meal we enjoyed Maine Lobster Ravioli (a small portion, but decently tasty), Spicy King Crab spaghetti (a smaller portion, also decently tasty), Eggplant Parmesan (so-so), one of the specials (some kind of spicy pasta that was very good), and sides of brussels sprouts and garlic whipped potatoes. For dessert, we finished with classic affogato (enjoyable), Bill's Chocolate Budino (interesting but enjoyable), and Lemon-Basil sorbetto (more basil than lemon but very tasty and enjoyable).<br><br>Value: For an upscale and classy joint like this you can expect to pay a little more than normal.

The restaurant is stunning, I absolutely LOVED the ambiance. It is great for a date night or a night out with the gals. <br><br>As we were seated, we waited quite some time for our server to come to the table. When he finally arrived, he was acting as if he was forced to be there...gave us a couple of menus and wandered off.

Our server was MIA for quite some time. A different server came to our table as she could see we were waiting...and she was awesome in answering our questions about cocktails and the menu. I really wish she had stayed with us for the duration of our dining experience. <br><br>K, enough about the service. On to the food! The portions here are a bit smaller than other establishments, so you are recommended to order a few items. My husband and I ordered 2 appetizers (I think these change often), 2 pastas (Spicy King Crab and Handmade Cavatelli w/ pork and beef ragu), Eggplant Parm, and 2 sides (roasted cauliflower and garlic whipped potatoes w/ gorgonzola). EVERYTHING we ordered was absolutely tasty!!! We had enough leftovers...so, I think we could've gotten one less side or entree.  I can't wait to go back and try the other items on the menu!<br><br>We were so full that we didn't order dessert. An interesting tidbit...the tables around us were getting free desserts (mini gelato cones...super cute!) for celebrating birthdays and anniversaries...not us. WHY? Because our server barely communicated with us. Good thing we were full...haha. I just hope we don't end up with the same guy when we go back.

Yes. But not pretentious. LOVE that.<br><br>The menu is set up so you're eating like Italians eat... you've got some small plates to share at the beginning, a pasta course, a main course, dessert... it's actually a great way to set up a meal and not feel like you have to rush. (I definitely appreciate this... always rushing... probably one of several reasons I enjoy my time here so much.) <br><br>In terms of what to drink... they have a pretty inventive cocktail menu, but I'm a pinot noir fan and they have a well-curated list (broken into categories such as \"Soft and Approachable Reds) that just happens to include my favorite: 2012 Arista Pinot Noir. This place was already winning, but to have that particular bottle on their menu was a huge plus. <br><br>Now... the food. Because omg.<br><br>My two favorite small plates here are the fried olives (stuffed with fresh mozzarella and sausage) and (sorry, this was a special) the squash blossoms stuffed with housemade burrata. We usually get more than one order of fried olives, truth be told... doesn't matter if there's just two of us.<br><br>The provolone-stuffed peppers are also really good - sweet but with a good kick at the end. Another special, the pizzeta with truffles, was REALLY good - and we liked the little bit of \"show\" when a woman came out with the server to personally shave fresh truffles onto the dish. (I would pretty much recommend getting any dish with truffles just to watch that little bit... it was fun.) <br><br>Oh, and the truffled garlic bread (no show, but...) If you're drinking, order it. You'll want to compensate for all that delicious wine, and frankly... it's just REALLY good.<br><br>Pastas: I've tried the Raviolo a la RPM, Proscuitto Tortelloni, Papardelle Bolognese and Parm Risotto. These come in smaller portions (per the meal progression) but still more than enough for a meal if you're not a big eater. <br><br>Sicilian Pork Arrosti, the sea scallops with sweet corn puree, and the Faroe Island Salmon with pistachio pesto were all amazing entrees... we shared them so we were able to try all three (as we did with everything else) but these aren't served \"family style\" per se... it just worked out that way for us.<br><br>For dessert, yeah, they've got a good menu... but just go with the tartufo (hazelnut gelato in an incredible chocolate shell.

We arrived here 15 minutes early of our dinner reservation, and we pretty much had to wait until our reservation time to be seated.

I'm not sure if all tables are like that, but i'm not much of a fan of that style. <br><br>I ordered a bottle of wine, but it was a fail. I wanted to order a light red since we're eating pasta, but I ordered a 2013 italian red that tasted too young. It was 100% my fault, but if i was the restaurant, i wouldn't add it to the menu for another year. <br><br>For apps, we shared the prime beef meatballs. DAMN they were the best dish of the night. They were moist and flavorful. I loved the marinara sauce because it wasn't too sweet at all. It paired with the meatballs perfectly. We almost placed a 2nd order since it was that good. <br><br>We shared 3 pasta entrees. We mutually agreed that the Spicy King Crab with squid ink pasta was the best pasta dish. The king crab had a little kick to it and the squid ink was briney at its best. You really felt like you were tasting the ocean, which is how you know you are eating good squid ink pasta. <br><br>My 2nd fave dish was the Bucatini with pomodoro sauce and basil. The bucatini was slightly overcooked and the pomodoro sauce was a bit too sweet. I feel like the sauce was different from the meatballs. However, the simplicity still made the pasta shine in this dish. Overall it was solid but i'm being too anal comparing it to the spaghetti marinara from Scarpetta. <br><br>Lastly, the last pasta dish was the Pappardelle bolognese. It was okay. Again the pasta was slightly overcooked and the meat was mediocre. It wasn't a bad dish, but it was just forgettable as I have had better pappardelle bolognese at other restaurants.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This place is soooooo good.

I could definitely get better fish at any Greek restaurant for a fraction of the cost at RPM. <br><br>In conclusion, I would say food is hit or miss.

My family loved it so much we ordered a second plate.<br><br>We also had their caesar salad. Very different from traditional caesar salads (which normally turns me off) but it was outstanding. The lettuce was incredibly fresh and crisp. The dressing was delicious and I loved the added touch of hardboiled eggs, restaurants rarely do that anymore.<br><br>For our entrees, my family shared the lobster ravioli, carbonara and spaghetti & meatballs. The lobster ravioli was unbelievable. I especially appreciated that they didn't overdo it with the sauce, they just let the lobster flavour be the main priority (I think they must have mixed the lobster with ricotta cheese or something. So good).<br><br>Carbonara was just as good as the ravioli. They bring the dish to the table with an egg yolk on top of the pasta and then mix it in front of you (neat little trick). It's rich and flavourful but not too heavy like other carbonaras I've had.<br><br>Finally: the spaghetti with famous meatballs. Definitely an awesome dish, but not on the same level as the other two. Probably would have been more impressed if I hadn't tried it in comparison with the other dishes. Definitely still worth a taste though! The meatballs were perfectly soft and juicy.<br><br>We finished it off with the tiramisu and chocolate sorbet. The tiramisu was kind of deconstructed and my family said they loved it. I had the sorbet and it was unreal. However, be warned it is REALLY chocolatey. Like three bites and your sweet tooth is good chocolatey. Worth it if you share though.<br><br>Finally, I was very impressed with their prices. All those dishes, plus two rounds of drinks and coffee, the bill was only about $150.

If it weren't for the amazing manager and bartender that night, I'd never come back. <br><br>The hostesses were snooty and basic. I don't use the word \"basic\" usually... but when I Googled the meaning, these girls met the criteria. Not only were they basic, they were liars. They lied to my face. When I first arrived, they eyed me up and down like I was trash, which is crazy because, well, I'm not trash. The only thing that I could think might have upset them (wrongfully) is that we had been at a music show earlier that afternoon, so we were in maxi dresses vs classier dresses or attire. Whatever. My first experience at RPM was in jeans on a Saturday night, and it was amazing start-to-finish. <br><br>After said nasty looks, the hostess told me that we'd be seated in 15 minutes. That was perfect. We headed to the bar for a drink. They said they'd find us. 30 minutes later, I went to the hostess stand to check our status. She wouldn't even look at me, acted annoyed and said, \"I can't seat you until 11:45pm\". Well, that was 15 minutes before RPM closes and not to mention another HOUR longer than we had already waited. I'm no mathematician, but that would be 1.15 hours longer than they originally said. I asked if there was seating in the bar area. There was a man slouching over the front desk by this time. She looked at him and said, \"I dunno, is there?\" He said, unmoved, \"Probably.\" I said, \"OK, can we just sit there if it's open or do you need to seat us?\" The girl replied, \"We'd need to seat you.\" I said, \"OK, so can you check if there is a table? We'll wait to be seated.\" She then, no lie, proceed to point around the corner and said, \"You can go check.\" WHAT? Like... WHAT? I waved her off, went back to the bar to get my sister and told her I wanted to go somewhere else, that they were being really rude and added an hour to our wait and wouldn't even help me be sat in the bar area, which was supposedly not a \"first come first served\" type thing but would need to seat myself, yet wait to be seated...? Dunno. Total mystery. Bottom line is, I felt like they didn't want us there. <br><br>HERE COMES THE GOOD PART. The bartender (who was amazing, by the way) overheard me telling my sister what happened. As I asked for the check for my drink, he told us to wait one minute while he got the manager. I felt badly. I really don't like making scenes or stinks. If you're a jerk, I walk away. I don't like drama. Life's too short. But the manager came over QUICKLY. It was happening. He apologized profusely and said he'd get us seated in the dining room right away. We told him the bar area was fine, but he insisted that we sit in the dining room, where we originally hoped to be sat. HIGH. CLASS. Worthy of the RPM brand. The bartender didn't charge me for my drink. I tipped him big, of course. He didn't need to do that. HIGH. CLASS. Worthy of the RPM brand. The manager came back after a quick moment and escorted us to the dining room, where there were TONS OF TABLES AVAILABLE and remained available during our entire meal. I'll never know why those tables were open and the hostess didn't want to seat us. Maybe she thought she had reservations coming in who never showed. I've worked in the restaurant business. I get it. But what is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE in hospitality is a lack of hospitality.<br><br>The food was amazing, per usual. The wait staff was kind and attentive, per usual, which is why I always loved this place. The ONLY reason I'll try this place again is because of the manager that night, the bartender that night, and the food that night and always. The hostesses might need retrained. Or maybe they're just terrible people. If that's the case, I'd strongly suggest RPM send them packing. RPM is too wonderful to allow people like that to tarnish its reputation. This is Chicago.

The staff by the host stand were more concerned socializing with each other than working on our table or letting us know the status of it. I had to walk up twice to get information about our table. So they finally seated us at the worst spot ever it was in the corner and right behind me was the register and the extra equipment. Constantly waiters were behind me chatting and grabbing stuff. You shouldn't have a table so close to working station. The waiter explained stuff in lightning speed like he didn't even care if we understood what he said or not. He talked so fast I didn't catch anything nobody would. The part that really upset me was when I asked if certain pasta dishes we could substitute things to make it vegetarian he goes why would you do that? He goes we have vegetarian options.

Very polite, very attentive. And they were great about mentioning my friends bday from my open table reservation and brought her a treat in the end without me having to ask.

For a \"celebrity\" owned restaurant, this place is pretty darn good. Atmosphere was posh and modern - very downtowny. There was a lot of energy surrounding the restaurant. There were people on dates, business dinner, family with children and just bunch of friends getting together. The vibe was upscale and the prices range from around $8 to $50. <br><br>I was with a big group. We were celebrating a friend's birthday. We ordered all kinds of stuff from the menu. Just the way I like to eat!<br><br>We started with the 600 day Prosciutto that was just superb! It looked like a flower arrangement. It was so darn pretty! It looked more like a pink hydrangea than a bunch of thinly sliced cured pork leg. The prosciutto hit the spot, then it was followed by Truffled Garlic Bread (yum!), a wood oven pizzettes (yum yum), and Wood Roasted Octopus with chickpeas and celery (yum yum yum).<br><br>Then, we ordered several pasta dishes: Raviolo with sweet corn, Spicy King Crab with squid ink spaghetti, Sweet Pea Risotto, and Pappardelle Bolognese. The Spicy king crab was so good we ordered a second plate. My favorite was the pappardelle. It was just delicious. Lastly, we ordered a whole grilled Branzino. It was fresh, delicate, cooked nicely, but I was still in love with the pappardelle.<br><br>For desserts, Bill's chocolate Budino with salted caramel and cocoa nibs was very decadent. That was a proper dessert. We also ordered Affogato made with this special coffee that was made somehow using a high pressure method and then bottled.

And for our entrees I got the spicy crab and she got the Mama DiPandi's pasta and added a meatball. This meatball was the size of a softball, biggest meatball I'd ever seen!

She watches the Rancic's program on TV and has also had an internship with Lettuce Entertain You. For those reasons, she has been begging me to try RPM.<br><br>The 3 of us had reservations for 4:30pm on a Friday, since anything after that was booked until 10pm. Plan way ahead of time, this place gets crowded!<br><br>The décor of the place is very modern, dimly lit, and classy. Themes of black and white dominated everything from the tables to the servers uniforms. Most of the people inside were pretty well dressed, looked important, and a bit on the hip/younger side, for what that's worth.<br><br>Let me begin by saying this is definitely \"modern\" Italian. Do NOT expect chicken 'parm the size of Nonno's 45 vinyls, but rather an almost tapa-style menu with a variety of flavors. Regardless, Spaghetti and the classic aforementioned chicken 'parm, had a quiet little corner on the menu, for the hardcore traditionalists. <br><br>We began with the Ricotta & Seminola toast, which was great! A Combination of fresh ricotta and unique marinara was a great way to start off a \"brava sera.\" Although next time, I would like to try the Truffled garlic bread, since every review here seems to recommend it! As a cheese fanatic, I felt compelled to make my other family members indulge in the plate of four imported cheeses. This was probably the only thing we should NOT have gotten. The cheeses and jams were all interesting, but wasn't exactly $16 interesting, especially for the portion. We could have gotten some of the probably more interesting cold antipasti. But alas, the only one that stuck out was the gorgonzola, the other 2 both resembled a brie, and the pecorino wasn't as good as some of the imported parmesans I've had.  Lastly, we ordered the pepperoni \"pizzette\" which despite its small size, had big flavors. I wasn't quite aware pizza could be THAT classy.<br><br>We all ordered something different and tried each others' dishes. Both cousins had a slow-roasted dish and I opted for the Short Rib Pansotti. The Herb-Roasted Chicken was decent, but like many Italian chicken dishes, was a little bland in my opinion. On the contrary though, the Sicilian Pork Arrosti with Kale and Polenta was remarkably good. The meat was savory and had a smoky flavor to it. Couple that with some old-school creamy polenta, and in my opinion, tastier-than-spinach Kale, it was impressive! I opted for the heavier-in-consistency but smaller-in-portion Short Rib Pansotti. This was definitely awesome. With an interesting Tellagio cream sauce and delicious short rib filled Pansotti, this is was the cat's pajamas of pasta and meat. We had also decided to split a side of the garlic-whipped potatoes, which were seasoned perfectly and topped with some of the bite-y 'gorg from earlier. <br><br>Cocktails all around for our crew, we aren't necessarily wino's and didn't want to dive into the olympic swimming pool of a wine list, split a bottle of something pricey, ask about pairings, etc. Traditionally, the Elmwood Manhattan was pretty strong and conventional. The Americano Cobbler appeared girly and tasted cheery. Lastly, the Pomegranate Gimlet was, by unanimous decision, the most flavorful and well-concocted of the 3 beverages. Unfortunately though, none of these really wowed me at the $11 price level.<br><br>Really great! Not overly attentive, and I never felt neglected in any way. Our server gave detailed responses to our questions and was very polite in every possible way. My only constructive and by no means authoritative criticism would be for her to raise her voice, especially when it gets crowded in there! <br><br>Summary:<br>RPM is awesome, I would say there are some hidden gems for the true Italian food connoisseur to try there. The atmosphere is hip and trendy, inside modern, service top notch, drink list extensive and most importantly the food was fantastic. My only qualms would be some of the portion sizes vs cost, and that probably by luck I wasn't overly impressed with any of the cocktails. But, do NOT get me wrong at all, this place was the BOMB!<br><br>I will be back and do recommend!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5tEo1rfoSAP1ULVwgkfkMQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "Short Rib Pansotti, Sicilian Pork Arrosti and Herb-Roasted Chicken.

For pasta: carbonara - not sure I liked the thick spaghetti version, but sauce was just right, creamy but no too heavy eith nice crunchy pieces; lobster ravioli - quite good when it comes to the filling, not sure the sauce was the greatest pairing (tomato sauce); pancetta and ricotta filled ravioli - I found the filling to be quite salty, probably because of the pancetta, but a very generous filling (always appreciate that in ravioli). I thought all the pasta were somehow missing out on the freshness and flavor of freshly made pasta (could these be cooked from frozen? I don't know.

The wine list is mainly 7-10 dollar bottles marked up beyond 10x. If you are looking for pre club beats and impressing your friends with high tabs; food that is on par with Cheesecake factory in 15% the proportions; with groups of 30-something aged ladies being visually undressed by leering aged business men this is your sweet spot.

I had the Pasta Carbonara which was THE BEST I have ever had. The pasta had fresh panchetta and an egg yolk on top. A server came and mixed the egg into the pasta. I ate every single last bite, this was because it was excellent but also because the portions are pretty small. But to keep things in perspective, this is a high end restaurant in downtown Chicago and the dish is only $14.00. We had the hazelnut ice cream ball for dessert, as well as the canoli and they brought 4 mini gelatos on tiny cones for my friend who was celebrating her birthday. Dessert was delicious and something I'd say that RPM does well. All and all the food and service were good.

Very modern, hipster type of place, geared to the \"in crowd.\" We actually got seated early, since we did arrive fifteen minutes early. <br><br>The service there is what you expect from a place of this magnitude. Professional, knowledgeable and courteous. To start off, we ordered the calamari and she wanted a charred pepperoni  \"pizzette.\" Presentation is big at this place, and we both noticed. Calamari was average at best; I've had better at many other establishments. The sauce that came with it was not your traditional tomato based sauce. Different is all I'll say. The pizzette.... just a personal pan pizza you can share with everyone. Nothing to rave about. For our main entrees we ordered the Maine Lobster Ravioli and the Spicy King Crap pasta dishes. I have to say again, presentation was on point but that's where it ended. The portion is not your typical Italian joint serving. It's about a third of it. The dishes were average, bland and lacked depth. Where was the salt and crushed pepper?! For the ravioli, I had a couple of them where the pasta was undercooked. To add to our meal we had  the truffle garlic bread and Caesar salad come out before the pasta entrees. Bread was on point, presentation of the salad was as well but who puts horse radish on a Caesar salad. That killed it for me. <br><br>All together, it was ok. The dance music playing wasn't overpowering, but it also doesn't say \"romantic evening\" to me. If you like that atmosphere, then go for it, but if you are looking for an Italian joint, where the food is off the wall, portions are bigger, Dean Martin or Frank Sinatra are playing in the background, and the walls are littered with pictures of famous people who have been there, this ain't your place.

It's definitely a place to see and be seen, however we were there the night before the Oscars so Giuliana unfortunately was no where to be seen. The place was jam packed at 6pm on a Saturday night when we had our reservation, not a place to breathe. Luckily, I requested a booth so our seating arrangement was a little better and more private. However, it was still loud and I think the place is more appropriate for a girls night out than a romantic first date.

We decided to go with cocktails for drinks.  I had the Sergio Leone and my boyfriend had the Long Faced Dove.  The Sergio Leone was so good, we both ordered it as our second drink.  For food, we decided to order the special pizzette of the night, the tuna bruschetta, the lobster ravioli, goat cheese ravioli.  Keep in mind the portion sizes here are pretty small.  The lobster ravioli was excellent.  At some point, a couple was seated next to us, and we had to do the awkward moving of our table so they could be seated because there was just no room.  I also learned way more about this couple than I ever cared to know.  Getting back to our meal, we had seen the servers bringing out what looked like a large chocolate ball at night to tables and it looked so good!  We asked our server which dessert it was because we had to have it.  It turns out it was the hazelnut tartufo.  So good!  One of the best desserts I've had in a long time!  We enjoyed our food and drinks at RPM so much that if only judging based on that, I wouldn't hesitate to give five stars.  However, because we were made to wait for a table with a reservation in a half empty restaurant and we felt cramped most of the evening, I had to take it down to four.  If dining here, request a booth, as they looked quite nice with plenty of space!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7CaCATHPI4NsUWhgnGvbkw/348s.jpg", "caption": "Hazelnut tartufo- order this!"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Q_WBnJgn7-E6IXZ-aYA6uA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Lobster ravioli"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/I8KCafNaux_G7c5-3S4HNg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Special pizzette"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Great experience.

Horrible I know but it's the truth. I figured it would just be another trendy restaurant where the who's who hangs out and makes a big deal out of it but that the food would be sub par or average at best. I was very wary about a trendy Italian spot in the River North area. <br><br>The moment I walked in I was pleased. I just loved the atmosphere and decor. The bar area is wide open and welcoming and the dining room is very posh and chic. My friend and I were lead to our table and seated next to a couple of guys dining out which was nice because we ended up making chit chat and sharing our opinions of cocktails and food we each ordered and ended up mutually upselling for the waiter. <br><br>What first impressed me beyond the interior was the service. It was top-notch and I can easily say that it was some of the best dining service I have ever experienced. Not only was our server incredibly personable and on point all night but even the food runner, water guy, manager.... everyone was just great and so on top of their game. I've never seen such great team work. Every employee was working and helping one another.<br><br>And I must say I truly enjoyed the food. We had:<br><br>One of the Pizettes which my friend and I both loved. It was tasty and cooked just right. The crust was perfectly crispy. It's small but for a little started it's fine (comes with 4 small pieces). <br><br>Polenta w/ Truffle & Poached Egg - I believe anything with truffle is tasty and this was definitely tasty. Not my favorite dish but enjoyable.<br><br>Gnocchi w/ Gorgonzola & Sage - This was so delicious.  I love gnocchi and this was by far the largest pieces of gnocchi I've seen. The gorgonzola and sage were great compliments to one another.<br><br>Pesto Pasta - This was good but not great. I enjoyed but definitely not the best pesto I've had. My friend really enjoyed it though.<br><br>Pasta Carbonera - This isn't really my kind of dish but my friend really wanted it and we were sharing everything. Again I thought it was good but not great. My friend really liked it.<br><br>Eggplant Parmesan - This was probably my favorite dish. It was so delicious and tasty. And I thought it was a perfect portion. I would come back and order just this and maybe a cocktail and appetizer and be happy.<br><br>Parmesan Potatoes - We ordered these thanks to our new dining buddies next to us. They had them and they looked delicious and when we inquired they suggested we order them , too. So we did. And they were good. Very tasty and I could see myself ordering them again.<br><br>Billy's Chocolate Budino (delectable chocolate mousse w/ heavenly salted caramel & cocoa nibs) - Our server really enjoyed serving us as did our table runner so they decided to surprise us with this special gratis dessert. Great surprise. And very tasty. This dessert is very unique and not something you see on other menus. I'd recommend trying it. I'd also recommend the gelato sampler which our table neighbors ordered and judging by their clean plate after I'd say it's worth a go plus it looked delicious and that's what I probably would have ordered had we not be surprised with a free sweet treat.

The squash blossoms were delicious - they were stuffed with cheese and dipped in tempura batter and deep fried. They were delicate, and they just melted in your mouth. Absolutely delicious!!

It's too bad that morel mushrooms are only in season for a short time, the pasta was good. Morels didn't taste like mushrooms, very meaty and the pasta it was served with came with a light sauce.

I was lured here because of my slight appreciation for the Rancics. However, the \"soft core\" epicurean in me was quite skeptical of the level of food I would find. Often \"Hollywood celebrity\" restaurants and some \"star chef\" establishments wind up being more pomp than substance. RPM's food was delightfully (and somewhat surprisingly) delicious and on par with some of the finer establishments in Chicago. <br><br>I ordered a Padua Sour for a cocktail. It's Grey Goose, Aperol, Lemon, and Orange Bitters. It's well-balanced and not too sweet yet not too bitter. <br><br>We started off with a side of the prime beef meatballs and truffle oil garlic bread. WOW. Paired together... it's magical. Sop up some of that meatball sauce with the garlic bread and seriously... you could make a meal out of that alone! So good! One side of the bread, however, wasn't toasted as well as the other side. Half the bread was a little softer and less crispy, but no big deal... still packed a wallop of flavor. <br><br>We also ordered three pastas. (They're all small portions.) Instantly, I suspected the short rib pappardelle would be fantastic... and it was. Easily my favorite pasta of the night. It had melt-in-your-mouth short rib meat on top of a bed of pappardelle pasta and a lovely tomato/bolognese sauce. There was a hint of rosemary and pecorino as well. The butternut agnolotti was also quite nice; a little bit on the sweeter side, of course. The proscuitto tortelloni was a toss-up. On the one hand, I liked that they were shaped like dumplings and the meat (for good and bad reasons) tasted like breakfast sausage links. (Jimmy Dean, anyone?) Now, I admit I do love sausage, but I didn't think the flavors would resemble a generic type of breakfast meat. The dumpling skin was a bit tough as well. I think maybe one more minute of cooking or steaming or whatever would've softened it just right. The sauce for the tortelloni was also quite forgettable. It was a clear and somewhat creamy sauce with parsley. While not a complete failure, that was my least favorite of the night. <br><br>We also ordered the chicken liver crostini with pancetta. I understand these are one-bite crostinis, but there was way too much liver for each piece of bread. It should've been scaled down a bit... or they could've put it on a larger piece of crostini. <br><br>Lastly, we ordered the tarfufo for dessert. Okay I am really glad we decided to share this dessert since it was massive! It's basically one huge ferrero rocher... not that I'm complaining! It resembled that candy in both flavor and presentation. It's definitely an eye-catching dessert and turned heads from the tables around us. The table next to us had to know what we were eating. \"Tartufo!\" we said, and they stared at it for some time. (Hmm... I kinda felt uncomfortable with the staring! [Which is why I don't like it when restaurant tables are put so close together. AWKWARD!]) Anyway! The tartufo was also served with two very small-mouthed spoons with large handles (that was actually a bit annoying since I felt a fork would be easier to eat with for this monstrosity.) <br><br>The ambiance of the restaurant: gorgeous. I loved the ceiling light fixtures, and the restaurant's overall clean lines do not distract you from your meal and who you're with. We had a 8:00 PM reservation on Monday. It was moderately dim in the restaurant, but come ~8:30ish, they dimmed it more and bumped the \"untz-untz-untz\" music higher. The serving staff all wear white coats (must be scary to serve tomato sauce with!) and the hostesses/hosts (from what I remember) all wore black. Very coordinated uniforms there, RPM!

 The vibe of this place does not shout buzzer.  OMG.  BOO.  The pretentious hostess, the pretentious vibe, the sleek wood with pops of white.  Definitely not buzzer like.  Oh well.  <br><br>After 20 or so mins we got seated in a half booth.  I have to say, I love me a good booth.  <br><br>Our server was really the reason I had to give this place 3 stars.  He was so pretentious.  First of all, lets say, a good waiter doesnt spill water all over my menu when we first sit down.  If you are going to act like god's gift, you better deliver.  This guy definitely did not.  <br><br>So the water was kind of annoying, but it just added to the annoyance of this guy.  I think he was more concerned with his hair than what we were saying.  Literally when we were ordering, he only got half of what we were saying.  We had ordered gnocchi that never came out and had to reorder it.  Same thing with dessert.  It was like, is anyone in there?  Are you listening to us?  <br><br>Also, we are very down to earth people and like real servers with honest opinions.  We all felt that this guy was just trying to upsell us the whole time.  Which in all honestly, if its the best stuff, thats fine but it didnt deliver.  This guy never cracked a smile or anything, it was UNCOMFORTABLE.<br><br>The food was pretty good.  I have to say, I actually LOVED almost all of the small plates that we got.  The pastas were good, but nothing that I would be dreaming about or anything that I felt was special.<br><br>We had:<br>Burrata-this was my first experience with this.  I thought it was fantastic.  The cheese was creamy and the jam just made a perfect compliment to the cheese and bread, not to mention the arugula that it was paired with too.  <br>Ricotta-delicious!  It was creamy and rich, but not overpowering.  It came with a great little tomato sauce too.<br>Artichokes-probably one of my favorite things that we ate.  I dont know how they prepared them.  It was like roasted and then lightly fried.  YUM!  I could have ate these all night.<br>Zucchini Flowers-they were good.  Reminded me of squash blossoms that everyone is obsessed with right now.<br>Brussel Sprouts-good, however, I felt as though the dressing was too mayo-y.  It didnt say anything about mayo in the description.  It said avocado and it definitely didnt taste avocado-y.  Meh.<br>Prime Beef Meatballs-yes, they were good.  Great seasoning, great texture.  Delicious.<br>Potato Gnocchi-it was just ok for me.  We shouldve gotten the wood fire one, but the server talked us out of it.  Said this one was better...however, again, upsell, upsell.<br>Mama's Bucatini-yes, it was good.  Did I think it was great?  Not really.  <br>King Crab-this was probably my least favorite dish.  There was barely any crab.  It was flavorless.  Again, another great selection by the server.  I would definitely not recommend this.<br>Cannoli-I have to admit, I am not a huge fan of cannoli, but this was really good.  Creamy, sweet, crunchy, not overpowering.  <br>Budino-YUM!  I love the chocolate and caramel and salt.  It was heaven in a bowl!<br><br>Overall, I think if we would have just ordered what we wanted and not listened to our server, we would have enjoyed it more.  I felt that most of the small plates were fantastic, most of the pasta was good, but nothing out of the ordinary, the desserts were fantastic, the vibe is pretentious with a Chili flair (BUZZER????).  The portions are small, however what do you expect???

On one hand, I liked most of the food, but the \"scene\" is not really my style, especially at the bar, where it's a version of the bros that hang in Wrigleyville, except with more disposable income. I got to experience some of that while I was waiting for my friend to arrive for our recent dinner there.<br><br>I got there a bit early, so I bellied up to the bar to enjoy a cocktail while I waited for her. The cocktail list wasn't all that impressive, so I stuck with my current go-to cocktail of a Tom Collins instead of one on their list. The bartender wasn't all that friendly and the drink was not good. In fact, I'm fairly sure it was made with lime juice; it certainly didn't taste like any Tom Collins I've ever had before.<br><br>My friend got there and we were shown to our table. The dining room is very elegant and dramatic, and even at 5:30 (the only reservation time we could get on a Monday night!), it was quite crowded.<br><br>Our waiter was jovial and gave us some guidance on the menu, and its focus on \"shared plates.\" I have to say, I'm really over this trend in food. When portion sizes are barely big enough for one person, how the heck are you supposed to share? Much to my chagrin, it looks like this trend shows no signs of letting up.<br><br>Anyway, we zeroed in on lobster caprese salad, the truffled garlic bread that everyone raves about, fritto misto, roman-style artichokes, and the duck agnolotti.<br><br>Things began arriving. As expected, the lobster caprese was ridiculously small: three tiny pieces of lobster, three or four grape tomatoes and three mozzarella balls. While it was very fresh, beautifully presented, and tasted delicious, it was barely more than a taste for each of us. And it was $16!!! I will say that the truffled garlic bread was a generous portion, and in this case, it was almost too much of a good thing as it was very rich.<br><br>The fritto misto was fried calamari, shrimp, and some pieces of asparagus, and served with a lemon aioli. We both enjoyed this but I don't think either of us were blown away, but really, fried calamari and shrimp can only be so bold. The artichokes were quite tasty and I would definitely order those again.<br><br>The duck agnolotti was also a small portion and this served as my friend's main course so I didn't try it. I was still hungry so I ordered the poached egg over polenta with shaved truffles. This dish was a disappointment. First of all, it was about 30 seconds undercooked so the white of the egg was still clear. Ick. I probably should have sent it back but I didn't. I just kind of ate around it. I didn't get much of the earthy truffle flavor, in fact, this dish didn't have a lot of flavor at all.<br><br>I was anticipating dessert, but again, none of the selections seem worth the calorie splurge, so I declined. My friend opted for the rice pudding gelato. In hindsight, I wished I would have tried it as it sounded intriguing.

My reservation was at 5pm on a Friday.  It was pretty empty when I first got there but filled up pretty quick. <br><br>Like a lot of other reviewers, I'm a fan of Giuliana and Bill Rancic, so I felt compelled to try this place when I was in town.  I've been dying to try Mama DePandi's pasta.  <br><br>I shared the following dishes with one other person:<br>-Truffled Garlic Bread (3.5 / 5)<br>-Fried Olives (2.5 / 5 )<br>-Lobster Caprese (4.5 / 5)<br>-Guiliana's Italian Salad (5 / 5)<br>-Mama DePandi's Bucatini Pomodoro (3.5 / 5)<br>-Prime Beef Meatballs (4 / 5)<br>-Spaghetti and Meatball (3.5 / 5)<br>-Tartufo (3.5 / 5)<br><br>The two of us were pretty full afterwards.  In retrospect, I probably wouldn't have gotten the fried olives (small and just ok) or the Prime Beef Meatballs (good but had too much food and there was a giant meatball with the Spaghetti and Meatball that I could've shared with my Mama DePandi pasta as well). <br><br>Both of us agreed that the Italian salad was the best choice (simple salad but great dressing and flavor combination) and the Lobster Caprese (fresh and tasty but not that big) was a close second.  The garlic bread was decent by itself but it was best for dipping in the pasta sauce.  Mama D's pasta was not bad but I had high expectations so I thought it'd be a lot better.  It was good with the meatball added.  The bucatini kind of reminded me of a Japanese Udon noodle. Thick and chewy. The spaghetti and meatball tasted a little similar to Mama D's pasta (just thinner noodles).

However, service in quality restaurants do not treat customers in this manner, especially after we have just spent a considerable amount of money.   Honestly, this is why I hate the whole tipping thing.  Restaurant owners should train & pay their staff for quality team work.   Managers should be visiting with the tables to ensure everything is satisfactory and if not, then fix it. <br>    As I mentioned in my review from my first visit, there are plenty of great restaurants in Chicago and I plan to check them out before coming back here.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Interior design is just as beautiful as RPM Steak!

The Lobster Caprese is a must-get if you ever come here. Not only is it not your typical tomato caprese, but it also leaves a very fresh taste in your mouth afterwards. The combination is truly heavenly. Next on my appetizer list would be the Garlic Bread; it was the perfect crisp and had just the right amount of garlic so your mouth doesn't smell for the rest of the night. The other appetizers were delicious as well, but nothing unique to RPM.<br><br>For the main entree I ordered the Sweet Potato Gnocchi Eggplant Parmesan, which was good but would not recommend. I personally wasn't too impressed by it other than the fact the pasta was made of sweet potato. I wish they had more brussel sprouts, but there were maybe 3 small pieces in the sauce. Be sure to ask for the specials of that day too.<br><br>Although we all enjoyed the dinner, the desserts were truly the highlight of our meal. You must, YOU MUST order the Tartufo, which is hazelnut ice cream inside a crispy chocolate shell. As my friend put it, this is the Ferrero Rocher chocolate in ice cream form and ten times bigger. The Bundino was also good, but make sure to scoop from the bottom up so you don't just get the bitter caramel part. You can't go wrong with any of the gelatos here - each scoop is similar to the size of an orange so definitely share your desserts.

The food itself in my opinion does not justify the price. We started with the Lobster Caprese ($17) and provolone stuffed peppers ($5). The peppers were fantastic, and we will definitely be making these at home in the future for dinner parties. The Lobster Caprese just was not good. For main course we had the Spicy King Crab ($17) and Mama Depandi Buccatini ($11) with added meatball ($3). The Buccatini was simple, but very good. The spicy king crab, which is squid ink spaghetti tasted like it belonged in a thai restaurant. Wouldn't order this ever again. We also each had a glass of wine.

One person from our party was late and they wouldn't seat us until the entire party was present. I understand that it's a trendy place, but not seating the entire party for just one person missing was disappointing. We ended up ordering drinks at the bar while we waited just a few minutes. Once we all arrived, we then had to wait another few minutes for the hostess desk to clear again. The service was impeccable. Our waiter was always close by and always checking in on us....a little too much. It got to a point where we'd stop middle conversation to tell him we were still okay. The bus boys were always quick to clear the table, which was good since the plates are huge and the tables are teeny tiny. We had to constantly maneuver dishes, silverware and glasses around the table to make room. The waiter informed us that the plates are meant for sharing.  When you look at the prices, you would think they were full entrees; they definitely were not. The huge size of the dishware actually made the food look smaller. Also, you would think they'd have much more menu options for such a popular restaurant. One person ordered the Maine Lobster Ravioli, which she thought could be her entire meal. There was only like 5 pieces.  She said it was delicious, but she was still hungry even though it cost $16. She ended up loading up on the garlic-whipped potatoes we ordered for the table. I opted for short rib, which was very tender and tasteful. I highly recommend it. We ordered the Tartufo for the table.  It was a large ball of hazelnut gelato with a hard chocolate shell on the outside.  It was too chocolately in my opinion.  It was also hard to break into with a spoon or fork.

Plus, I didn't find the portions to be that small, at all. For a group of 4 we each ordered our own pasta - and it was plenty since we had ordered apps, garlic bread, and meatballs to share. The smaller portion allows you to enjoy other things on the menu. <br><br>Everything I've had here is great - if I were to make two recommendations it would be the garlic bread and the meatballs. Best I've ever had. <br><br>I agree with some that the service isn't top notch - but no one was rude. Just a bit slow/clueless. I'm sure (or I hope) time will solve this.

I could have spent the same at Rosebud and had enough for leftovers. RPM would have saved face if the gnocchi was good, but the sauce had a taste of a Campbell soup. The only dish the actually had flavor was the Cavatelli pasta, but it's not worth waiting 3 weeks to try it. <br><br>If you are a man and like having large portions where you don't have to go to Xoco afterwards to be full....dont go here.

(5/5)  Sarah got the Pomegranate Gimlet, which also was pretty light and had a good flavor.  I preferred my drink to hers, but both were good. (4/5).  After Brittany explained the menu, we decided to do a few of the small bites first.  We started with he Prime Beef Meatballs, and the Truffled Garlic Bread.  First, the meatballs, they were quite large, very fragrant, and smothered in a homemade marinara like sauce.  They were so delicious by themselves, but then you introduce the Truffled Garlic Bread, and your senses approached an overload of awesome.  They went together like peas and carrots!  The portions felt much larger than a traditional Tapas kind of menu, so we were ready to jump into our main entrees after finishing these items.<br><br>Sarah choose the Spicy King Crab - Squid Ink Spaghetti. (4/5)  Brittany recommended asking for extra sauce to kick the flavor up a bit, so we rolled with it.  Even with the extra sauce, we didn't feel like it was Spicy at all.  It had a good flavor, just not as a strong of a flavor as we were expecting.  Still very good, but needed a bit more of a kick I think to be called spicy.<br><br>I went with the 8 oz. All-Natural Filet Mignon (5/5) along with the Garlic Whipped Potatoes (3.5/5).  The filet was one of the best that I have ever had anywhere.  It was nice and thick and wonderful.  When it first came out it looked to be overdone, due to the crazy amount of searing on the outside.  It turns out that it was in fact cooked perfectly to a medium rare on the inside, and the outside was seared so well, due to their wood firing technique.  It was melt in your mouth good.  LOVED IT!  The potatoes, for me weren't anything special.  For 8 dollars, I was expecting these potatoes to knock my socks off, but sadly they stayed in place.  They weren't bad by any means, but they weren't overly flavorful or unique.<br><br>For dessert, we were brought a tiny flight of Gelato's and Sorbetto's for our anniversary.  It came with Limoncello, Chocolate, Coconut, and Coffee. (5/5) All were very flavorful and great.  I only wish they were more than tiny cones and scoops.  If I had enough room and I wasn't so cold from being in Chicago in the winter I would have ordered bigger amounts.  The last part of the meal, was the dessert special (Bomboloni) (5/5) which Brittany also recommended.  They were these small square pastries, that were so light and fluffy that you could barely hold them without crushing them from your grip.  They were rolled in cinnamon and sugar I believe, and had a Nutella and a whipped cheese dipping spread.  I was unsure about these, but they were so heavenly.  <br><br>After sitting for a while to digest and make enough room to finish our wine, it was time for our check.  I didn't really look at any prices, I just wanted to have a good experience, so naturally I was a bit nervous.  It came, and I was pleasantly surprised.  It was about 38 dollars under what I had budgeted for the meal.  Since Brittany was such an amazing server I went ahead and left her about a 40% tip.  I figured I had budgeted a lot more so why not give it to someone who is the master of her craft.<br><br>The bottom line here, is this place lives up to the hype for sure.  You need to run, not walk to this place and have a great experience.  Just make sure you do yourself the favor of asking for Brittany when you make the reservation!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The server was told we were celebrating our birthdays, but did not mention anything when she greeted us.

All of us enjoyed our experience and I can confidently say that it is worth the wait. The restaurant is beautiful, has a gorgeous bar and gives out a fun, exciting vibe. Lots of good people watching.There was an odd moment at the very beginning however. We arrived slightly before our 7:30 reservation time and one of the seating hostesses led us to a table by the kitchen door. After waiting for months to get into this place, we were put off by the table and requested that we sit somewhere else. My partner, Chris, noticed that there were small amounts of food on the floor by that door. For such an upscale establishment, we were a bit surprised by all of this. Couldn't they have designed a more discreet entrance to the kitchen? Anyways, it was a minor hiccup and thankfully we were seated in a sleek, clubby section of the restaurant towards the back, past the bar. <br><br>I believe the name of our waitress was Falon. I have to say, she was one of the best servers we have had in a long, long time. She was presentable, welcoming and very, very knowledgeable.

A couple of our friends split a bottle of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo and it was a big hit. <br><br>A few of us ordered our own Caesar Wedge Salads. We were all impressed with the size and the wonderful flavors. Two friends split Giuliana's Italian Salad and were very complimentary of the dish. I ordered the Chicken Parmesan for my main entree.

In my humble opinion, it lacked a bit of a wow factor, given the hype of the restaurant but it was not horrible by any means. Other main entrees that were ordered included the Halibut, the Lamb special and the Chicken Cacciatore. Grilled asparagus and Garlic-Whipped Potatoes were ordered as well. Everything received high praise. Note: the Chicken Cacciatore is quite spicy. It was Chris's birthday and we shared mini ice cream cones that were on the house. <br><br>All in all, we found our RPM Italian experience to be wonderful.

Regardless, the bread was still yummy, and you bet your ass we finished the entire thing.<br><br>Next up was some fried olives for the pregnant chick, which I did not try because I'm not a fan of olives, but she said they were great.

I myself have only made polenta a couple of times, and mine has more flavor than RPM's. We both had a couple of bites and decided not to waste our calories on it.<br><br>After that, we shared the arancini - words cannot explain how amazing this is! I've had arancini from several different restaurants, and this blows them all away. The flavor and texture were so unique, and even though it's a fried rice ball, it wasn't heavy or too filling. The only thing we didn't like was that the order only came with one arancini, and we had to share it! <br><br>Time for pasta! We debated a while on which to get, but we finally settled on Mama DePandi's bucatini pomodoro, which we added the prime beef meatballs to, and the prosciutto tortelloni. My personal favorite was the basic bucatini - you can tell that the pasta was super fresh, and was cooked perfectly. The sauce was fantastic and not too heavy - when paired with the meatballs, it was just absolute italian perfection! By far, the best version of  \"spaghetti and meatballs\" I've ever had at a restaurant. The tortellini was great, it was stuffed with prosciutto and mascarpone cheese and in a nice, somewhat creamy, butter rosemary sauce. It was almost too much flavor packed in one tiny dish, but still enjoyable. I went back for seconds with the bucatini and let my friend finish the tortellini.<br><br>Now the best part: dessert. You MUST get the chocolate budino. I've never had anything like it. I almost can't even explain it, really all there is to say is that it's salty, caramel-ey, chocolatey goodness - and despite it's richness, it's hard to put the spoon down. <br><br>I can't wait to come back and try more items!

So, needless to say, I had pretty high expectations of this place. I went with two friends, and these high expectations were met and were even surpassed. As crazy as it sounds, I think I could easily call RPM my favorite restaurant ever. And, shocker, I'm not even too into Italian food. So you know this had to be good. <br><br>First of all, the atmosphere was pretty cool. Very modern, clean, and classy. Pretty much exactly what you'd expect from G&B. Be prepared for loud music, though. But it does make you want to dance! (I saw a few people dancing in their seats that night). And for anyone with a shameful love for boy bands: don't worry, they even played One Direction while we were there. <br><br>Our waiter was amazing. Super friendly and very helpful with giving recommendations and answering any questions that we had. He even sent us out some of the mini ice cream cones  , which was super sweet!<br><br>For appetizers, we got both the zucchini fritti, the stuffed squash blossoms, and the meatballs. They were both SO good. We got the zucchini after it was recommended by the waiter, and it was just as good as he described. They were tempura fried but still pretty light. And the squash blossoms - amazing! Seriously, get both. <br><br>We also got the meatballs after seeing all the rave reviews on here. The tomato sauce was perfect - chunky, but not too chunky, and very well-seasoned. And the meatballs - yum! <br><br>For our main course, we got the agnolotti pasta with shaved truffles on top. Seriously, they bring out a bowl of truffles, and shave them on top of the pasta right in front of you. The dish was really good, and I can assure you, that there was nothing left on that plate once we were done - we downed the pasta, sauce, and truffles. <br><br>For dessert we split the tarfuto, the gelato with rice pudding, and the mini ice cream cones mentioned above. Definitely get the tartufo if you like nutella or ferrero rocher chocolates; it's legit a giant, ice cream version of a ferrero rocher. You'll wish you had more than one even if you are stuffed. The gelato was also good, and I'm not even a big rice pudding person.<br><br>I also got the Piccolo Rosa drink. Amazing.<br><br>Easily the best meal I've had yet.

My boyfriend and I went here to celebrate our anniversary, and we had a really wonderful time! The food, service, and atmosphere were all amazing, and I would give them 5 stars expect for a few minor details. Really, they deserve like a 4.5, but I settled on a 4 instead. I'll explain why.<br><br>First, we got there and even though we had a reservation (8:45 on a Thursday) they said they were behind and we would need to wait for about a half hour. We waited in the very swanky bar area, but it was packed, and couldn't sit. The bartender noticed us fairly quickly and so we were able to order beers and stand by the wall. What was supposed to be a half hour ended up being about 15 minute wait, so neither of us finished our drinks. Not a huge deal, but we were planning on ordering a bottle of wine at the table, so we had to slam two beers first. Not exactly what we were going for on a classy night out, but I digress. <br><br>Our table was one of those little ones that has a chair on one side and shared a booth along the wall with several other tables. Again, not a big deal, but I was jealous of the couples that got to snuggle up in the huge rounded and secluded booths across from us. I was sort of bumping elbows with the big group to our left and our table was also too small to keep the aforementioned bottle of wine on. Luckily, our server kept it chilled at the server station and was very attentive in making sure our glasses were always filled. I can't remember our waitress' name, but she was great. She had red hair and glasses, if that helps. She was very knowledgeable about the menu, friendly, and as I mentioned earlier, attentive. Once, when my date was in the bathroom she stopped by to make conversation with me about what we were celebrating, how long we had been together, and things like that. It was nice.<br><br>We started with three appetizers -- the lobster caprese, the truffle garlic bread, and the fritto misto. WOW. The truffle garlic bread was to die for, the lobster caprese was amazing, and the fritto misto was delicious, although the soft shell crab was bit difficult to eat because of the shell. For entrees I got the pesto gnocchi and my boyfriend got the squid ink pasta. The gnocchi was done to perfection, but the pesto was a little chunky for my taste. Still delicious, though. The squid ink pasta was insanely good, I got to snag a bite, and it was flavorful and very unique. We wanted to save room for dessert, but we were stuffed so we passed. However, even though I didn't expect the waitress to do anything special after I mentioned it was our anniversary during our chat, she brought out two adorable mini waffle cups filled with sorbet -- one vanilla and one raspberry. There was even a little candle. I thought that was such a nice touch, and the sorbet was the perfect ending to our meal. <br><br>Sorry for the long review -- basically we had a great time.

The menu is very extensive. It's quite difficult to narrow down what to order, and with four people, there were a lot of things we didn't get to try.

With the exception of the brussels sprouts salad (just okay) and the fried burrata (glorified mozzarella sticks--burrata is better as is), we really enjoyed these. The soft shell crab frito misto was delicious and the garlic bread lives up to the hype. It's fantastic. For our next course, we shared two pastas, the sweet pea agnolotti and the king crab squid ink spaghetti. Both of these were very, very good. The agnolotti was light and creamy and the squid ink spaghetti had just a hint of heat, al dente pasta, and a good amount of crab. Delicious. Next, we had entrees. I had the lobster ravioli as my entree which was very good. Nice light portion if you're not looking to eat a lot. Others at my table had the veal chop, swordfish, and spaghetti and meatballs. The veal chop was amazing, the swordfish (while on the thin side) was tasty, and the spaghetti and meatballs was very well done. Definitely an amped of version of that easy classic. For dessert, we shared the special bomboloni (fried dough), budino, and rice pudding. The bomboloni were exquisite. It was one of the best pieces of fried dough I've ever had: light, fluffy, crispy, delicious. I was expecting more of a cake/hot dessert for the budino so I was a little let down by the cold pudding that arrived, but it was still tasty. I really loved the rice pudding but I wish there was more of it. The ice cream:rice pudding ratio was way off, with only a thin layer of rice pudding under mounds and mounds of vanilla ice cream. The small amount of rice pudding we did have was delicious though. Overall, we had a great meal at RPM. Nothing particularly blew my mind but it's good quality Italian food across the board.

I was surprised how busy the place was when I left.  <br><br>Our table started the meal with fried olives, provolone-stuffed peppers, and imported burrata. I definitely recommend the fried olives! Who knew olives could be so tasty and filling when fried?  Just a warning, the provolone-stuffed peppers have a little kick to them.  <br><br>Next, we tried three salads: Shredded Brussels Sprouts, Tuscan Kale, and Giuliana's Italian Salad. All were great! My personal favorite was the Shredded Brussels Sprouts with bread crumbs and avocado. My boyfriend was a huge fan of Giuliana's Italian Salad with the mix of peppers and meat. Others at the table really enjoyed the Tuscan Kale with the spinach and cheese.<br><br>Then, we tried four pastas: Mama DePandi's Bucatini Pomodoro, Short Rib Pappardelle, Ricotta Raviolo, and the Sweet Corn Agnolotti. As many know, Mama DePandi's dish is what spiraled into the ideas of creating RPM. It was hands down my favorite pasta. It lived up to the hype! If you are only going to order one pasta, definitely order it! Others at the table really liked the sweet corn agnolotti. It was a unique type of pasta stuffed with a sweet corn sauce. <br><br>Finally for dinner, we had the Sea Bass and the Prime Dry- Aged Bristecca Fiorentina. The sides that were served were garlic whipped potatoes and sauteed broccolini. The steak was incredible! Unbelievable seasoning and salty around the crust. I don't like fish, so I am not a good judge of the Sea Bass. The potatoes and broccolini were both received well by the table.<br><br>For dessert, we had the baked cannoli, rice pudding gelato, and Bill's Chocolate Budino. The cannoli was great with an orange flavor! The rice pudding gelato was well received. Many commented it was the best rice pudding they have had! My personal favorite was Bill's Chocolate Budino. Wow! It was a bowl of chocolate, salted caramel, and chocolate balls. It is a perfect mix of sweet and salty. Make sure you save room for dessert just to try this! <br><br>The service was great and very attentive. They were very accommodating for people with food allergies in the group.

A glass of wine and a cocktail with Jameson set us back almost 30 dollars and definitely dampened our mood right off the bat. Luckily, we were seated promptly, not more than 5 minutes past our reservation time. Our server must've been related to the bartender (or had the same training), as she barely cracked a smile.

If we had been eating at an earlier time, I'm sure it wouldn't have been enough to fill us up.  However, both foods were sources of redemption for RPM and this rating.

I love to eat out and dine at some of Chicago's best restaurants but when it comes to Italian food, I set my standards to big meals and delicious bread with olive oil and cheese.  Wait... yes you have to pay $7 for bread here.  We didn't do that either.<br><br>So after much deliberation on what we would all order we decided to try two appetizers based on reviews we had read: Frito Misto and Polenta with Poached Egg.  The fried fish was mediocre, I expect better calamari and the polenta was actually mushy and pretty gross.  I can't believe people recommended that as an appetizer.  We all went with Giuliana's Italian Salad which was delicious.   Very good ingredients and the flavor was awesome.  My mom and aunt split this salad and the kitchen split it for them, I do love when restaurants accommodate that way.  For my entrée I went with Carbonara pasta.  My boyfriend also ordered this pasta.  We both really enjoyed it, almost be worth asking them to double the order and paying $26 for a full portion.  Him and I also shared a side order of meatballs and paid to add 1 more so we each had 2.  They were good, but nothing over the top in flavor at all.  My boyfriend also ordered the smoked ricotta cavatelli which he said was good but again, not amazing. My brother had the eggplant parmesan which I don't think he was disappointed with but he was more or less looking for just a yummy chicken entrée which clearly they don't really offer on their menu.  My mom and aunt split the Whole Grilled Branzino Sea Bass.  This dish was nicely plated and a decent portion at $58 and serves two.  Again this item is solo so for their side they split the strozzapreti.  I believe they ate less than  1/2 of it because it just lacked taste.  It was overpowered by basil and just not really good.<br><br>For dessert, we shared the Tartufo which was bland and the special gelato which was nutella and bananas which was probably the best part of the meal for all of us.<br><br>After a few glasses of wine and all this food the bill was pretty up there and I don't think any of us left happy with the experience.  Well, what can I say?  I wanted to go RPM and I went but I do not feel the need to go back again.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Wonderful environment and staff.

We went NUTS ordering the homemade ricotta (A MUST), toasts with chicken livers, arancini, grilled octopus (A MUST), and the fried olives. The red sauce they give you with the arancini tasted EXACTLY like my Sicilian great-grandmother's, an amazing surprise. We were dipping that ricotta crostini in that gravy like it was going out of style. The olives were really unique and just salty enough, definitely worth trying. The rest of the apps were good, but my favorites and must haves were definitely the grilled octopus with garbanzo beans (a texture AND flavor explosion) and the ricotta.<br><br>For our meals, we each got a different pasta. I went with the king crab with squid ink pasta, one friend got the gnocchi, and the other friend got the Maine Lobster Ravioli. The King Crab was PHENOMENAL. So much flavor, just enough spice, creamy, TONS of crab meat, and such a great portion that I ate my leftovers for breakfast the next morning and they were STILL delicious.

The gnocchi was good, it had the same Sunday gravy we had with the arancini and a boatload of cheese.<br><br>For dessert, there wasn't even a decision to be made. I'm one of those people that if cannolis are on the menu, you don't have to sell me, I'm ordering the damn things no matter what.

Least fave was the peppers, but everyone else devoured them ,so I was the odd one out here. I just think for whatever reason I was expecting them to be hot and the cheese melty, which is not the case - they're served cold.

The decor is very modern and well designed, albeit loud. And our server was extremely patient, very informative and provided just the right amount of attentiveness. You know what I mean - there when needed him, but not overbearing and in the way. And the dirty vodka martini with blue cheese olives was delicious. But sadly, I can't give much more praise than that. And I really, really wanted to.  <br><br>Perhaps I'm biased by the impression I had before even stepping foot inside. The valet experience was horrible. It wasn't the fault of the guys doing the actual valeting - but whoever is/was in charge of setting it up and coordinating the logistics and traffic flow is terrible. I pulled up behind a car. Apparently, three other cars thought it was a valet line, too, and pulled in behind me. Then I discovered that there was no one in the car in front of me. And the valets were not coming to move it. So I got out of the car and waved to the valet. He gestured that I needed to pull up. \"I can't!\" The three cars behind me saw this exchange and were able to pull around me. The valet eventually came over to get my car.<br><br>The food was decent, but not worth the price. Don't get me wrong -I don't mind paying for a great dinner. But the food has to be worth it. It was our monthly girls' night out and we shared an assortment of appetizers and pasta plates. Except for the fried olives, none of the appetizers really made an impression as something I can only get there and make me want to return. The potato gnocchi was my choice for one of our pasta plates, and while the sauce was really good, the potato gnocchi itself was really squishy and fair, at best.   <br><br>Speaking of girls' night out - this seems to be the trendy spot for such an activity. I'm pretty sure that more than half the tables were groups of 4+ women. There's nothing wrong with that, but it just gave me an impression that apparently this is the current \"It\" place. But you know how that cycle goes. I don't think it will be as popular once the trendiness wears off and girls' nights move on to the next It restaurant. One of the people in my party predicts it will be closed within 18 months. If not, it will be because of the support it receives as part of the LEYE group.<br><br>And back to the valet. I lost track of how long it took for my car to arrive. I do recall excusing myself from the table a while before my friends. When they eventually came out of the restaurant, they couldn't believe I was *still* waiting for my car.  I still tipped the valet, but they didn't have correct change for one of my friends (even including her tip).

I love that its a bustling spot that you can actually carry a conversation on in. I.e. the music isn't on insanely loud & walls don't seem to echo every ones conversation. Great place to have dinner with a lot of friends, a few friends or date because you'll be able to hear everything everyone is saying without having to shout over the tables or pretend you hear your friend at the other end. <br><br>As I've noted in reviews past, its pretty tough for Italian restaurants to impress me. As an Italian, nothing beats home cooking. While RPM was not Mamma's or Nonna's cooking it was definitely a great bite to eat. What I really love about RPM is the price point - incredibly reasonable! I was shocked when I saw the prices on the menu (in a good way!). Small plates for $5-6, pasta entree's for $12-19 and of course, higher end steaks and fish, if that strikes your fancy. My friend and I split a couple of plates, below is what we had with reviews in tow:<br><br>Provolone Stuff Peppers: Meh. Nothing to write home about. The kick from the pepper paired with the cheese was an interesting mediley. Very light and fresh, but feel free to skip it unless you are a pepper-lover. <br><br>Prosciutto Wrapped Figs: In the word of Mrs. Rancic herself AMAZEBALLS. Holy, moly these things were SO good. You must order them! There were five or six on the plate and both my friend and I wished there were five more once we polished the plate off. <br><br>Note - this next dish was created by yours truly so if you want to try this great mix-up you'll have to ask specifically for it. I ordered the truffled garlic bread because I'd heard great things from other reviews, however, I couldn't not try their \"home made riccotta\" so I ordered the bread w/ a side of ricotta. DE-LICIOUS. I am a ricotta lover, I grew up on fresh ricotta from local farms in Italy. While the RPM ricotta doesn't really compare to the stuff in Italia it did hit the spot. Highly recommend this mash-up if you're looking to try the yummy bread & ricotta. Be sure to credit me though... jk. <br><br>Pasta Dish 1 - Short Rib Pappardelle. It was good, not great, but good. The amount of short rib in the dish was a little disappointing but the dish was good. I recommend it if you're looking for a classic italian dish w/ a twist. <br><br>Pasta Dish 2 - Prosciutto Tortelloni. It was good.. keep in mind there are only 5 tortelloni in the dish so if you're looking to share you'll only get a small piece of the actual dish. Thats the one down side, but I guess you get what you pay for.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Part of the 5 star review here is the gentleman that served our table...David V. was fabulous!  He had all<br>The right recommendations for our group.  In addition to David's service, the food and cocktail menu were excellent.  Some of our favorites were the figs, fried olives and the truffle pizza as for the drinks we loved the Americano Cobbler and the Classic Bellini.  Great place!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I was beyond excited to go to RPM.

This time around we got 2 choices.  One was Bills Chocolate Budino.  An incredible chocolate mousse/pudding with a thick layer of slated caramel on top. The other one we chose wasn't listed on the menu but sounds too good to pass out.  They were small beignet like pastries with nutella inside and sprinkled with sugar.  <br>The atmosphere is modern and fun but it can feel like you are eating in a nightclub minus the annoying lights.  Eating in the bar area is a much quieter option.  Yes the portions are small but it is something I expected, even before the waitress told us.  Points for being up front about it, especially in a city that prides itself on steaks the size of whole cows.  That being said, if you are a lover of steak houses that make you say \"how am I going to eat all this?\", RPM may not be for  you.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qaQB9N5cZeg0U4r07kDBXg/348s.jpg", "caption": "Ricotta toast"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Where should I start?  My brother and me decided to go for Italian as a celebration for my first time in the city and landing a job here in Chicago with one of the best Cardiovascular teams a girl could ask for. First the service was disappointing. When I walked in to be seated I informed the hostess that I had called regarding reservations, but was kept on hold twice and after 2 calls and one hour later I decided to just walk in.  The hostess stated \" i cannot do anything about that, however if you see a free seat at the bar you can have dinner there because we have exclusive guests who reserve a couple of months in advance.  That alone should have been my first clue to walk out, but I figured give the place the benefit of the doubt because it appeared busy and rushed, I attributed the rudeness from the hostess being under stress. So after 40 minutes of waiting My brother and me found a table and sat down only to have the table wiped down and feel sticky.  <br><br>We decided to order the mushrooms, fired olives and the short rib pasta, buccatini, and lobster ravioli. I am a person who cooks and bakes very well and I am a big foodie, so I love to try different dishes when I do try a restaurant.  My brother tried his ravioli and was not impressed because his food was somewhat cold and buccatini really soft.  My short ribs were very gelatinous with little meat and you think the chef would know to trim some of the fat before braising it in the ragu sauce...need I say I was left with a very oily and bland taste in my mouth. The portion sizes are small for dishes that range from $35 on upwards.  <br><br> When I informed the waiter, he approached me somewhat offensive by first stating that short ribs are beef with fat on them as if I did not know what I ordered. I explained to him that I cook a lot with a variety of meats, being that my father is a butcher I know all to well what a short rib tastes like and how to cook it. So he walked away and said hold on shaking his head without saying anything. By this point I regretted coming to this place and my brother felt the service was poor due to the fact the waiter just snuffed our concerns about our meal like it did not matter.  He returned back and stated that he would take the drinks off our bill.  Hmm my brother ordered a Malbec and I had water with lemon being I had to work the next day.<br><br>I have dined in many  \"high class/well known\" Italian eateries in NYC..Del Posto, Becco,  etc...all of which never disappoint.  However, RPM you disappoint on levels of service and food. When a person dines at your establishment and has concerns regarding food, then take it seriously because return customers keep you in business. Also it is never the best business judgement to have 2 people walk away after spending $130 dollars on a tasteless meal cooked with what appeared no love .  Bill and G you are better off on T.V. and stay out of the kitchen please because i did not taste the love of Mama DePandi cooking.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "One word for RPM...ehhhh<br><br>This place made me think of a time when I met a really hot guy at a club in LA.

The meatballs were FANTASTIC, really tender and succulent and surrounded by one of the best marinaras I've had outside of my Italian grandmothers kitchen! the olives were boring - they lost their brininess and bite by being fried.

We liked the Spicy King Crab better; it was a squid ink pasta with a spicy sauce and king crab meat - but even that had an overly fishy taste to it, like the crab wasn't fresh. The pappardelle was rather boring and there was something off about how they cooked the fresh pasta.<br><br>We would give the restaurant another chance for the food, as there were many other menu items that we thought sounded good but didn't get to order, but I think one of the most disappointing things was the overall service.

time, I expect to be seated at that time.  Is that asking for too much?<br><br>So we are finally seated and ordered a bottle of wine.  The wine glasses came but the wine didn't.  So we waited, and waited, and waited for that to come.  Finally we ordered some apps which were decent.   We had the meatballs, arancini, and polenta with the poached egg.  The meatballs weren't hot, they were lukewarm at best, and if you don't eat the polenta within 3 minutes of it being served to you, it gets freezing cold and is not very appetizing.  The arancini were probably the best part of the apps.<br><br>I asked our server about the portion sizes for the pasta entrees, because they were priced similarly to the appetizers and I had read other reviews on here about them being small.  She told me they were a \"handful\" of pasta meant to be shared.  If I hadn't had asked her and we had just ordered two for our entrees, we definitely would've been disappointed so please don't expect the waitstaff to be helpful in explaining the menu.  She also forgot to tell us the special for the night, oops.  <br><br>The pastas came, we ordered Mama DePandi's Bucatini Pomodoro which was very good, the Short rib papardelle, another delicious choice, and the wild boar sausage which was also good.  By that time we were pretty full so we didn't get to try any of the seafood entrees, but a neighboring table had the giant prawns which looked great.<br><br>For dessert we had the chocolate ice cream which was wrapped in a hard chocolate shell with hazelnuts.  If you love hazelnuts definitely get this dessert, it's big enough for at least 3 or 4 people to share.<br><br>So overall, the fact that we waited a half hour to be seated, combined with the poor service, definitely made me not have any desire to come

Jake, our waiter explained that the portions are european portions and are smaller. We ordered the truffled garlic bread which was good but I found a little too salty for my taste. Probably my least favorite dish. The fried olives were AMAZING. We ended up ordering a 2nd order. The portion was very small & I could have honestly eaten a whole basket of these. Yummm! We shared Giuliana's Italian salad, also delicious! We each had a small portion, probably better to be shared between 2. <br><br>The entrees were all delicious. I had Mama DePandi's bucatini pomodoro. It was really delicious. Fresh pasta and a tasty red sauce that had a tiny kick to it. I wish there was a little more cheese on top. I suppose I could have asked but didn't. My sister ordered eggplant Parmesan, also very yummy. My mom had the special, a Dover sole fish. Jake said this dish is larger & could be shared between 2 people. My mom felt a little embarrassed when she ate the whole dish all to herself, but the portion was not that large. <br><br>I was stuffed by the time the dessert menu came but we were out for a special occasion so we couldn't pass. My mom wanted the cannoli's & enjoyed them although they were not the traditional cannoli. I am not a fan of cannoli's so can't really judge this dish. My sister & I shared a dessert special called bomboloni, which were little donuts stuffed with Nutella and covered in cinnamon sugar. They sounded amazing but I thought they were just ok. The whipped cream served with them was better! I wish we would have tried the gelato. <br><br>Our total bill was $180 but that also included 5 alcoholic beverages. Not too bad, especially since we were out for a special occasion. <br><br>I will definitely return to RPM! I didn't mind the smaller portions.

My girlfriend has been wanting to go to this restaurant for over a year because she is a big fan of Giuliana Rancic (E! host who owns the spot). We normally eat steak in Chicago, but I figured we could use a change-up. I had to make the reservation about a month in advanced and even then, I could only get 10 P.M. I will break down the review by category because each one is equally important to me when fine dining.<br><br>Ambiance: 5/5<br><br>This place was really cool inside. The décor was incomparable to any restaurant I have been to. It was extremely trendy and VERY spacious. The restaurant was absolutely huge. It had these cool white chandeliers hanging from the ceiling which matched the white leather booths. Unfortunately, we didn't get to sit in one (see service section below) but I liked it nonetheless. We had a 10 o'clock reservation and the place was packed from the moment we sat down to the moment we left. The crowd was very young and hip, which fitted the décor. I couldn't have asked for more in terms of aesthetics.<br><br>Service: 4/5<br><br>Cons: We had a 10 o'clock reservation so I figured we would get a decent table. However, my girlfriend and I do look young so this does happen to us once and a while. Nevertheless, it is inexcusable because we did spend a lot of money. Other than that, they did charge us for an extra glass of wine but took it off once I reviewed the check and pointed it out. Now to the positives. <br><br>Pros: Overall, our waiter was great. He was very informative about the menu and a lot of his suggestions linked up to what I read on reviews. He did not try to up-sell us on a fancy bottle of wine or over-priced appetizers. He came back to the table several times to check in on us as the several dishes came out that we ordered- I appreciated this. He was also quick to fill the wine when we needed more. <br><br>Drinks: 5/5<br>We ordered wine by the glass, which I am normally skeptical about but I wanted a Chianti and my girlfriend wanted malbec, which is simply too sweet for me with Italian food so we ordered by the glass. The wine was really solid both had a decent amount of bite and good flavor. It seemed as though the bartender had a heavy pour and didn't simply measure the amount of wine exactly which I liked.  <br><br>Appetizers: 4/5<br>The appetizers were pretty good. I read a lot of reviews raving about the lobster caprese, which I really didn't think was anything to write home about. It was really small especially for $17. We ordered the truffle garlic bread which was absolutely BOMB. To accompany the truffle garlic bread, we ordered the prime meatballs. The sauce in the meatballs was outstanding and dipping the truffle garlic bread into the sauce was extremely palatable. If I went again, I would sub out the lobster caprese for the beef carpaccio. I wanted this the mrs. Isn't a fan of raw beef so we skipped out. However, I did see it on a few tables walking in and the portion looked HUGE, which in my experience is not common for carpaccio. <br><br>Main course: 3/5<br>This part of the meal threw me off. My girlfriend ordered the pasta carbonara which was standard. I needed to order the $46 bone- in Veal parm chop when I saw it on the menu. The veal parm came in two pieces- the bone with some meat on it and a standard veal parm. It was simply a veal parm and nothing special. Don't get me wrong it was good, but for $46 I expected fantastic. It wasn't especially thick and the separation of the bone and the main piece really threw me off. If I were to go back here, I would order a pasta (maybe the squid ink). <br><br>Desert: 5/5<br>We ordered the hazelnut Tartufo upon several reviews, the waiter's recommendation, and my love for hazelnut. This was an AWESOME desert. It was a nice size. The outside was coated in chocolate and hazelnut, the inside with a delectable cold gelato. And inside the middle of the ball was a big circular hazelnut flavored piece of chocolate. This was a very unique desert and I could not have been more pleased with it. <br><br>Rating: I will give this place a 4/5 for the top to bottom review. Next time I will not get the veal parm and order something else and I'm sure I would have a much better overall experience.

I came with a couple of girlfriends for a late-night dinner after a show at the House of Blues, and we couldn't have been happier. While not dressed in sequin cocktail dresses and heels, we came for a great meal and got it delivered. Best of all, especially since it was a late dinner, we left feeling completely satisfied but not wishing someone would deflate our stomachs. This is a great option whether it's before going out for a late-night dance-a-thon or if you simply want a quality meal in a convenient location.<br><br>THE RUNDOWN<br><br>Cocktails - Average at best. We tried four different cocktails and really only enjoyed one of them. I cannot remember the name, but I know it contained Gin and St. Germain. There's a reason why it's the most popular.<br><br>Fresh Burrata - Considering burrata is a great cheese, this dish is almost impossible to mess up. A ball of burrata is served with a salty outside layer and arugula, sun-dried tomatoes, and toasted bread on the side. A great dish, but considering this easily can be made at home, I'll probably spend my money on another next time.<br><br>Beef Carpaccio - Sliced thinly to perfection. Chunks of pecorino add a saltiness to the dish that was welcomed.<br><br>Tuscan Kale and Heirloom Spinach Salad - In my mind, crunchy chopped kale, lemon juice, olive oil, and parmesan is a great combination, and this salad did not disappoint. This dish is great if you're looking for something light and refreshing.<br><br>Polenta and Poached Egg - I love polenta and I love poached egg, so why wouldn't I love polenta with poached egg? If you're familiar with the perfection that is runny egg yolk and what it can do to a dish, then you'll love this, too. Anytime I thought I might want to add a tad bit more salt, I took a bite with the truffle and the parmesan, which made it great.<br><br>Wood-Grilled Octopus - The octopus was cooked and seasoned perfectly. It was served on top of a chickpea puree which tasted like a lighter, more lemony and garlicky- flavored hummus. Delicious.<br><br>Duck Agnolloti - Great dish. I love duck, and the pillowy pasta that it was served with was perfect. Leaves of brussel sprouts added a little bit of crunch. No sauce is served with this pasta, but the cooked (roasted?) mission figs added so much flavor that sauce was not missed.<br><br>Spicy King Crab Pasta - Squid-ink pasta cooked perfectly with chunks of king crab and hot peppers. I thought the spiciness was a great level without overpowering the dish. But, if you don't like spice, you can always opt out of the hot peppers. But really, do yourself a favor and stick with the hot peppers.<br><br>Rice Pudding Frozen Yogurt - Such a great combination. A great cinnamon flavor that was light and sweet enough for a post-meal bite.<br><br>Sour cream sorbet - So incredibly weird, but so incredibly good. We had it by itself, but we were told it's usually served with a pineapple carpaccio. If you can get a little taste of the sorbet, go for it.<br><br>A fig dessert that I can't remember the name of - Very light. The figs were served with some roasted nuts, a peanut type of concoction, and what I think was creme fraiche with syrup drizzled on top. If you need a couple bites of sweetness without feeling like you went over the edge, this is a great option.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "So, I want to preface this review by stating that I do not watch Bill & Guiliana's show and went to this restaurant because a someone couldn't make their reservation and a friend invited me last minute.  Boy am I glad I went!<br><br>We got to the restaurant around 6:30pm and grabbed a drink at the bar while the table was being prepared.  They have a cool drink selection, but the bar area was a bit small and we had to keep moving out of the way of the servers.  The setup of the bar area isn't that great, so I probably wouldn't recommend going there to grab a drink unless you can get a table or a seat at the bar.  There is pretty much no standing room.<br><br>Now for the food!  These are the dishes we ordered and my reviews:<br><br>Fritto Misto (4/5 stars): This dish was quite yummy!  It was made up of lightly battered calamari, shrimp, and asparagus served with a delicious lemon aioli sauce.<br><br>600-Day Proscuitto (4/5 stars): This proscuitto was scrumptious and served with crusty bread.<br><br>Prime Beef Meatballs (5/5 stars): I don't really enjoy meatballs very often, but I'll tell you these were incredible.  Perfectly moist, textured, and the basil marinara sauce was delicious.  One of my fave dishes of the night!<br><br>Polenta, Poached Egg (5/5 stars): This was by far my favorite dish of the night!

The ricotta is extra creamy with a little sweetness and rosemary and the toast pairs perfectly). The 3 of us shared the Shredded Brussels Sprout Salad (it was refreshing and a nice palette cleanser). For our entrees (let me clarify the word entree: they were not your average American sized dish, they were petite and the perfect size.<br>They are just right after having enjoyed multiple appetizers (which is highly recommended).

That pasta was to die for, I really hope they open a RPM in Los Angeles. The lobster ravioli was soooo good! My dad was super impressed that it was made purely of fresh lobster, no fillers or anything. He truly enjoyed his meal and said it was the best lobster ravioli he ever had.

Seriously, is the \"modern\" aspect of this restaurant the fact that they pretty much blast electronic dance music the entire time?!?!? Or is it the seemingly odd white suit jackets worn by the servers, accompanied by the stealth ear pieces they are wearing? It almost seemed as though the wait staff outnumbered the amount of guests in the restaurant.....great if you want your water refilled after each sip, not so much though if you're expecting a more relaxed and laid back atmosphere. With that said, 0 stars for ambiance here and I'm shocked that Lettuce Entertain You actually supported this WIlly Wonka concept. It's just way too over the top for a simpleton like myself.<br><br>As for the food, it was just ok. 3 stars at best, a bit pricey in terms of portion sizes. I would definitely recommend coming here with a group, as they have a lot of appetizers, small plates and salads that are great for sharing. There were 4 of us so we definitely got to try a lot of items. For starters, we went with the white figs, crispy ravioli, meatballs, truffled garlic bread and the shredded brussels sprout salad. I thought the figs were tasty, but the ravioli's were about the size of Chicklets. Again, some may call this modern, I see as flushing 6 bucks down the toilet. They weren't really even that good. As for the meatballs, I think my mom's are just as good, if not better. The sauce was nice and fresh, but nothing about the flavors or textures stood out. The winner to me was the brussel sprout salad. I liked the shredded sprouts and it paired well with the avocado.<br><br>For entrees I had the seafood risotto and split it with my buddy who had the filet. The risotto was good, but the filet was even better as it had a great char on the outside and was a perfect med rare. My wife had the Ravioli a la RPM which I thought was delicious.We all shared the Tartufo for dessert which was ok, but I'm not too much of a sweets guy anyways so, yeah.<br><br>Eric was our server and I have to say he was terrific. Very knowledgeable and kept us moving along with the meal very well without being too intrusive. Overall though, the music and atmosphere just killed it for me here. For the cost of the meal and quality of the food, there are simply a TON of other Italian restaurants I would chose to spend my money at than RPM.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Came here on a Thursday night with a date. It was probably one of the best meals I've had in Chicago. I really enjoyed the ambiance and decor, seemed like a Japanese restaurant at first glance with the clean lines and dim lighting.

Good for them. <br><br>We started with the meatballs and lobster ravioli both of which were prepared perfectly. My date's main was the eggplant parm which was good and I got the filet which was amazing.

We kind of did it family style.

The first impressions were very good and the space is beautiful with sleek white and black tones throughout (and I really like the server uniforms with white coats and black pants). The bar area is larger than I expected relative to the dining room but like Hub and Paris they have tables with the full menu too. It's no surprise that RPM will be another Melman hot spot in River North but there appears to be more of a focus on the dining experience and food.<br><br>The menu is large with a ton of options in many categories. We tried something from the salad section (shaved brussel sprouts) and a starter from the cold antipasti section (fresh burrata). There's also a bread section, a pizzette section, a hot anitpasti section and a wood oven section. Yes, all of that just for \"starters\" with lots of choices. The next part of the menu is house-made pasta and risotto. Our server explained that each plate is relative small and shareable and not meant to be an entree. We tired the pesto pasta and mushroom risotto and really liked both. There were other options in the section I would want to taste - definitely a highlight of the menu. Finally, after all the previous options there is the entree section with steaks & chops, fish, classics and sides. We were not in a steak mood so we tried the salmon with a side of asparagus. I appreciate that the salmon dish was simple and not a massive portion. It was well cooked and seasoned and a nice option. The asparagus was our least favorite dish. We finished with a delicious bowl of chocolate sorbetto.<br><br>It's not totally fair to judge the food and experience from a pre-opening, complimentary meal. There's a lot of good things going on that I know RPM will be a great addition to the area. My biggest complaints are the easiest the fix - service and front of house. I dislike waiting for a table and even more so when you have a reservation. I was confused why we had to wait another 30 minutes after our reservation time at 9pm on an evening when the restaurant isn't open to the public. Also, our service was good but at times seemed absent - just inconsistent and can get better with practice and training. Lastly the pricing is what you expect for a hot new spot with names like Rancic and Melman. Our bill was $125 for 2.5 courses with one entree and one dessert and one drink each. Add another entree and two more drinks and that's not a cheap night out. But in the end it's a beautiful and chic place to have a solid modern yet authentic Italian dinner.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I've been to this place twice. Both times, we received wonderful service and the food was always phenomenal! <br>The only thing that is against my taste is the dim lighting, but I can deal with it. It's modern and chic, but the food is delicious and tastes very home made. <br>Some of my favorites were the Squid ink spicy crab pasta. i honestly can't stop thinking about this dish. It's perfection ALL AROUND. The crab is tender and tastes sweet and fresh. The spicy sauce is creamy and delicious and it all blends really well together. The lobster caprese is delicious. My fiance is also obsessed! He loves that it comes with big chunks of lobster meat.. They definitely aren't greedy at RPM. <br>I also love their bread with the ricotta cheese. I also dream about this magnificent concoction on a weekly basis! The ricotta cheese is fresh and creamy and flavorful and the bread is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.. You spread the ricotta on the bread, top it with a little tomato sauce..... Please excuse me while I wipe the drool from my chin!<br>Mama DePandi's bucatini is delicious too. We ordered a side of meatballs (some of the best meatballs I've ever had in my life). As delicious as it really is, the Squid ink pasta is #1 in my heart. But the bucatini isn't far behind. <br>I've also had their ADORABLE little pepperoni pizza. It's good.. there's no such thing as bad pizza... And considering how tiny and adorable it was, I loved it even more! lol Keep in mind, the pizzas are tiny, so if that's all you want, I recommend ordering just that, as they aren't big enough to share unless you're ordering a bunch of stuff from the menu and sharing it \"family style\", which is what we did.<br><br>As far as drinks, the only cocktail I've tried is the Americano Cobbler. it was yummy and fruity, just how I like it. i wish it were a little bigger, but whatever, that's my problem. It's amazingly delicious. I also had their Pinot Grigio - Ca' Donini, Veneto. For being just $8 a glass, it was honestly one of the best glasses of Pinot I've ever had. I'm no wine expert and I seldom drink wine, so don't quote me on that.. But I really liked it. Very smooth. <br><br>DESSERTS! I've tried the tarfufo which was very yummy.. But since it was just me and my fiance, this giant ball of delicious chocolate gelato and hazlenut shell became a little redundant after about 4 spoonfuls. I recommend it if you're sharing it with 2 or 3 other people. But it was delicious.. It was just too much for the 2 of us after we had just stuffed our faces will all of the prior courses.<br>We also had these little beignet-donut thingies that came with a side of lemon curd and mascarpone for dipping. My fiance LOVED the mascarpone.. I thought they were delicious all on their own. I almost called off our engagement when he took my last piece and swallowed it whole when I wasn't looking. I've since then forgiven him, but it still left a hole in my heart. I'm sure that last piece was the best piece.. But I'll never know. Oddly enough, I can't seem to find these beignet-donutty things on the menu, so I don't know if it was just a special for the night or something you have to request. I''ll ask about them next time I go.. You can bet on it!<br><br>So yea, everything was awesome! I love this place and i love the service and I ESPECIALLY love the food. Everything tastes home made and fresh. i HIGHLY recommend. If you're going, please add me to your reservation. I'll just sit there quietly and eat my meal.. I'll even pay for my own food. I promise.

Well, they certainly showed me! <br><br>My wife had the wonderful pomodoro-like spaghetti plate. Well seasoned, great pasta. I had the lobster caprese. That was a nice, yet somewhat forgettable dish. This being said, very enjoyable and a small eatable portion. After that I had the RPM-equivalent of a paperdelle al ragout. Let me tell you, that dish was absolutely fantastic. The small pieces of short rib (English cut) were very softly stewed down, yet  they must have understood well that such a sauce should be made a day in advance. Why? It sets the gelatine in the meat and hardens it so as to receive a nice cut and bounce when biting in it. Stew, or meat sauce should never be processed/pureed meat. Well done. The papardelle was cooked wonderfully al dente.<br><br>Very impressive stuff, really! And, for the record, to all the bulk-eating people who feel like a pasta dish is not a pasta dish unless you can serve the entire bull team with the single deism, I am sorry, that is not what fine dining is about.

Lighter than your traditional gnocchi, and the sauce was amazing.  The truffle garlic bread was also outstanding, as was Guiliana's Italian Salad, SO good.  We also got the Roman Style Artichokes, they were great as well, not as mind blowing as the other apps but really good.  <br><br>By that time we were getting stuffed so we just shared one pasta, the arugula pesto, which was great.  I almost wish we had tried 2 more small plates instead of the pasta, b/c we had such a hard time narrowing down what to try.  Overall everything we had was just delicious though.<br><br>After dinner we had another person join us and ended up staying for a whole lot more wine.  We were there for 5 hours total and the place was packed the entire time.  Music was awesome too.   Our server never once made us feel like our time was up and we should go.  Overall just a fantastic experience.  RPM is awesome, go there, even if it's at 4pm.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "My fiancé had been dying to come here ever since she heard about it on Giuliana Rancic's show, so maybe she had over-hyped it to me, but here are my thoughts:<br><br>First off, the service was great--too good at times: pretty much every time we took a sip of our water (literally), there was someone there to refill our glasses.  I'm all for keeping guests well-hydrated, but this was a bit of overkill.  Our waiter was very nice and seemed knowledgeable and genuinely passionate about the food, but he was kind of pushy at times and overly up-selling expensive items.  He asked if we were ready for another bottle of wine when we each still had a full glass.<br><br>It is kind of difficult to decide how to order here as there are so many different categories on the menu.  Our waiter suggested that we should get multiple things to share, but customers at other tables each got their own dishes.  I would suggest going the sharing route, as the first 2/3 of the menu features relatively small plates.<br><br>The atmosphere was night-club-esque in terms of the decor/vibe (not music), which is great if you like that sort of thing, but it's not for me.<br><br>As for the food, we decided to try a bunch of different things and had some leftovers to bring home:<br>Truffled Garlic Bread: Very good, strong flavor but not much better than average garlic bread aside from the hint of truffle.   <br><br>Mozzarella Carrozza: Again, another item that was very good, but other than looking much fancier (cubes), it wasn't much better than an average mozzarella stick.  I do have to say that the Spicy Marinara, while not very spicy, was delectable.<br><br>Zucchini Fritti:  My fiancé loved these, but I felt that, while they were decent, the zucchini was so much thinner than the breading that I could barely taste the vegetable.  The whipped Marscarpone sauce was pretty good.<br><br>Pasta Trombas:  I had read about these online and was intrigued.  They basically look like pork rinds but are actually made of fried pasta.  At first, I wasn't impressed, but I quickly/strangely became addicted.  The cheese sprinkled over them was a nice touch.<br><br>Gnocchi al Forno:  Worst dish of the night--the \"gnocchi,\" if you can really call these that, were complete mush and just tasted like a pile of melted Gorgonzola<br><br>Prime Beef Meatballs: Amazing sauce.  The meatballs were delicious but not special--no better than ones I've made at home<br><br>Porcini Mushroom Risotto:  Rich, creamy, and delicious.  A must-try for any mushroom lover.  This was probably our favorite dish of the night.<br><br>Ravioli Americano: There was only sauce on the bottom of the dish, and it wasn't nearly enough.  The ravioli tasted like they were barely cooked--very disappointing.<br><br>Short Rib Pappardelle: The Pappardelle noodles were great, but mixing short rib into a pasta does not do the delicious cut justice.  The sauce was very strange, but I couldn't put my finger on why.<br><br>Despite our waiter suggesting we also share one of the large meat dishes, we were stuffed and couldn't even find room for dessert.<br><br>Overall, it was a decent experience, the food was a little above average, and if I could, I would give them 3.5 stars, but I just couldn't knock them up to a four.  The mushroom risotto and meatballs were definitely the best of what we tried.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I just got back from LA and ate at 3 amazing italian restaurants.  I didn't think that Chicago could compete after that trip (even though I do think Prosecco and Davanti are very good)...and had heard RPM is a fantastic place to go, though \"impossible\" to get reservations.  Ok.

We then moved on to the Lobster Caprese and we asked if would could try just the meatballs (it's normally served with pasta), and they gladly brought us out three . We loved all the apps! For entrees we ordered the Short Rib Pappardelle (short ribs were tender and pasta was cooked well) and King Crab and pasta. I mean how could you go wrong adding King Crab to pasta!<br>DESERT...everyone around us was talking about one desert last night...the Tartufo! A chocolate shell with gelato on the inside. I'm not normally a huge sweet guy, but I will be ordering the Tartufo every time I head back to RPM.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Didnt make it past the front door. The hostesses were super snotty and rude to us. I think they are aspiring to be the next kardashians. I wont eat at at place with pretentious nauseating people. Cancelled our rez and walked over the siena tavern which was amazing. Evening saved", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Sophisticated, sleek, romantic atmosphere. Very trendy and welcoming. The bar is a perfect square with ample seating and amazing wine. We made reservations a month in advance and had to confirmation the reservation... Which was a bit annoying but I understand they get a lot of requests so they really want to make sure you're coming. The appetizers were small portions but tasty. My friend and I each got pasta and were very impressed with the flavors. Mine was gluten free pasta and I couldn't taste the difference. Dessert was amazing. The rice pudding was anything but boring and her Canolis were impressive. Would absolutely go back again. Lots of dishes to try next time.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I love RPM!  Been here many times and I absolutely love the trendy, chic vibe of the black and white interior.  Drinks are delicious and food is amazing.<br><br>For drinks, I've really enjoyed the Classic Bellini and the plethora of wines on the list.<br><br>Some of my favorites include:  Truffle Garlic Bread, both of the pizzettes, Shredded Brussels Sprouts salad, Meatballs, Mama DePandi's Bucatini, and Lobster Ravioli.  The Tartufo for dessert is amazeballs!  I could eat the entire thing myself, probably resulting in stomach pains.  But it'd be well worth it!<br><br>The Spicy King Crab Squid Ink Spaghetti has been the only disappointing dish, thus far. <br><br>I have yet to try so many of the other dishes, so I'll keep coming back, especially in hopes of meeting Guiliana and Bill!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Went there last night anticipating an amazing meal and great scene (coming from the hub 51 people it had to be right?) Well, apparently not... We ordered several plates- the cheese stuffed peppers (oily and the cheese had no taste), tuna carpaccio (awesome) garlic bread (very good)Brussels sprout salad (bland) and a pasta dish(rigatoni and eggplant with marinara -decent), meatballs (very good)...And of them all it was the tuna that we found to be the best. There was nothing remarkable or inspired about the food. Better Italian fare may be found at Osteria via stato!<br><br>We ended up spending most of the evening at the bar after the meal and have to say that this scene was really great! The bartender was friendly (all the staff was extremely friendly and professional). In terms of drinks, the mixologist obviously knows what he's doing.<br><br>In short: Would not return for the food-that's for sure! However, if you're looking for a place to grab a drink and hang out with friends this is a (but not THE) place to be.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This is by far the best Italian meal I have ever had. An explosion of taste! If you ever find yourself in Chicago, make sure to go here. Heads up: make a reservation, this is a very popular place and is often filled up with people.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "One of those places where excellent dishes actually make up for lack of quality service. Recommended: Mama DePandi's Pomodoro Sauce Pasta + side of Garlic Whipped Potatoes. Ambiance: Pleasantly ritzy", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "When I travel to a city I like to go to restaurants by famous chefs. My wife wanted to go to RPM because of Julianna and Bill factor. Lucky enough for her Juliana was there shooting scenes for her reality show. <br><br> Now let's talk about the food. I started with the polenta with a placed egg , white truffles and parm  it was incredable!! Then I had the spicy king crab over squid ink spaghetti. I was both spicy and sweet it did not skimp out crab either it plenty of big pieces of crab meat. To finish the meal I had the coconut gellato the perfect end ro meal. <br> <br>I must also mention the waiter we had. Wish I remembered his name he was great knew the menu was engaging and didn't forget we were there. <br> Would definitely be eating here more if I lived in Chicago.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Last minute reservation. We had jeans on and felt very underdressed. The whole atmosphere is very elegant, I was very impressed. Our server was attentive, really enjoyed that. <br><br>I had the Pappardelle Bolognese and my bf had the Mushroom stuffed pasta. I detest mushrooms but my bf forced me to try his dish. I LOVED IT! I was amazed at how lovely and smooth the stuffed pasta was! <br><br>This will definitely be our new spot!", "pics": null}}]}
