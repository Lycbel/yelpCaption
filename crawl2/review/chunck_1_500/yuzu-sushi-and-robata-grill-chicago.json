Prior to dining at Yuzu in November the last time I had sushi was in Dubai in January and at that time I wasn't enthused. But a friend promised that the sushi at Yuzu was amazing and we had to go...<br> <br>So, with a bottle of wine in hand, as Yuzu is BYOB, we showed up at 8pm on a Wednesday for our reservation and were seated immediately. We initially ordered miso soups while we perused the menu deciding on which rolls to get. I was starving so we debated over 2 or 3 different rolls. The first we opted for was the \"La Vie en Rose\" which featured avocado and sweet potato, two of my favorite ingredients! We also got the \"Boston Crunchy\" which featured tuna, avocado, chili sauce, and had tempura crumbs sprinkled on top. And finally, we got the \"Motown Effect\" which featured smoked salmon and was deep fried.<br> <br>The miso soup arrived quickly and was as expected. Do I love miso? Not really but I didn't hate it. The first rolls that arrived were the \"La Vie en Rose\" and the \"Boston Crunchy.\" I loved the first roll and actually it was my favorite. The flavor was delicious and I could eat that roll all day! As for the second, it was very spicy, which I knew beforehand given that it featured chili sauce, but I struggled to eat more than a few pieces before reaching for a glass of water. Finally the \"Motown Effect\" arrived and it looked like a piece of art. The roll was huge, almost the size of my forearm, and the sauce swirls were so colorful and beautiful. The roll itself was hard to eat as it was too big to fit in my mouth but it was quite delicious and the sauces were good.<br> <br>Overall the rolls were delicious, even if they were a bit spicy, and looked fantastic. The service was great and judging by how full this place was on a Wednesday night at 8pm it's clearly popular. Will I go back? Heck yes! I'm already trying to plan my next trip there! Yuzu may have actually turned me into a sushi eater...  5 stars!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I kept seeing Yuzu Sushi all over my Instagram feed and the pictures were absolutely mesmerizing. I couldn't believe the art that could be made just for sushi!<br>It was pretty hard finding a table for four online and ended up booking two weeks in advance. It was cold out and everyone was huddled in the tiny vestibule entrance. Their host table was so small, and it was a hassle walking past people to get our table. All the tables are so close to each other that you could hear everyone's conversation - they clearly want to serve as many people as possible but they don't care if people are uncomfortable. <br>Looking at the menu, it was hard to decide what to pick. We were pressured to order a minute after sitting down. Who am I kidding - we were rushed the entire 45 minutes we were there. IT WAS BRUTAL. My better half stated he needed a second to look at the menu and she said \"can you please order now, can you please order now?\" I looked at her in disgust and thought wow is this real life? What kind of customer service is this.. We went to the bar across the street for drinks right after and I was able to breathe my own air again.<br>I'm also pretty sure that they were past capacity that night and heaven forbid a fire or something broke out we'd all die.<br>It's an instagrammable place - but not worth it one bit. Would never come again.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This place is awesome. I guarantee the experience will be like nothing you've ever seen before. Yes, this place is hyped, but I think it's worth it. The sushi is totally insta worthy, but actually tastes dang good too. Pro tip- these rolls are HUGE- you only need one per person! You will actually leave feeling FULL, something I've never experienced at a sushi restaurant. All their apps are great too, like the shrimp bites and tator tots. I could see some people thinking this place is \"butchering sushi\" or whatever but you just need to keep a very open mind.<br><br>Dropped a star because of the service-it's a small restaurant (almost always packed though) and somehow my waitress paid no attention to me last time I was there. Had to literally get out of my seat and flag her down. Unacceptable. Besides that, great place- your out of town friends and family will go crazy for it.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Fun place that seems to be a crowd pleaser because of their beautifully presented insta-worthy sushi plates with colorful sauces (I think it's colored mayo and eel sauce). <br><br>Sushi Gold comes with HUGE, good quality pieces of nigiri and one roll which was alright. Their jumbo sushi rolls are quite filling as well. Me being a exclusive tempura fan ordered the Chicago spring roll which was light, crunchy and delicious. <br><br>Service was quick and our server was guiding us well<br><br>Ambiance is chill with some fun anime characters adoring the wall. <br><br>Overall one of the good sushi places in town.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Yuzu provides a feast to your eyes, taste buds and your tummy!<br><br>Was definitely attracted to visit this joint because of the ridiculously beautiful platings, but am super happy that they matched the design with wonderfully fresh ingredients, textures, and explosion of flavors in the decorated sauce. <br><br>We ordered three yuzu jumbo sushi rolls, each costing around $17-19. Each came with different toppings, \"Dragonball\" had unagi, \"Summer Breeze & Ocean\" had seared ika (cuttlefish), and \"Born to Chill\" had salmon on top, but inside contains generous fillings as well. Therefore, with generous and fresh ingredients both inside and on top, the price is justified, not to mention the artistic touch! <br><br>Our favorite of the day was definitely \"Summer Breeze & Ocean.\" The seared ika was absolutely divine. This must be absolutely fresh otherwise it would be soft and flat rather than firm and springy as it should be. Moreover, the ika was perfectly seared, with delicious tuna, creamy avocado, scallion and fried shallots inside provided it with a multiple layer of textures. Matched with the Thai seafood sauce, it was totally rocking!<br><br>The Dragonball was no slouch too, and the design was the bomb! Absolutely eye catching and equally delicious. With salmon and shrimp tempura, matched with avocado, sweet soy sauce, and wasabi mayo, this is a loaded roll. The decorated sauce provides it with a further punch, the colors provides creaminess, spiciness and sweetness, hence a dragonball each mouthful!<br><br>Thanks for the great experience. Will definitely return, recommend friends and bring all out of town friends to boast Chicago's unique sushi joint!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MJnE_MCpUUvt5xojTGfHaA/168s.jpg", "caption": "Dragonball & Summer Ocean"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Ok I'm horrible at taking beautiful pictures of food.

You literally cant go wrong with any of the jumbo rolls, but please make sure you get the chicago roll..  it's awesome.<br><br>The service could use a little work, our waitress seemed annoyed with us asking her opinions on the rolls and repeatedly asked us \"if we were ready\" (with an undertone of hurry up). That being said, the foods worth it.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Yuzu has been popular on the gram for its elaborate artistic design and plating. The taste of the rolls itself is great, the fish is fresh, the rice perfectly cooked and just the right temperature. Unfortunately, my one big complaint is the artistic rolls are all 'jumbo' rolls which are way too big in size. Each piece is too big to eat in a bite and sushi is meant to be eaten one piece as a whole! I would still come back here, but I'm not sure if I'd want to take a jumbo roll again.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "We came here for lunch. We didn't have any reservations but got lucky to get a table quickly. It got packed really quick. This place has really tasteful sushi. Just look at the appealing designs on the photos! It makes you want to order everything so you can see the various intricate designs they do with the different sauces. <br><br>We also ordered the teriyaki salmon and tonkatsu ramen. I personally did not eat any of the salmon so I can't speak about it. The ramen was good, it comes with two hard boiled eggs and 3-4 pieces of pork. I don't think that is the norm in other ramen places because usually you'd get 1-2 measly servings of the meat. The ramen had rich umami broth, and I am telling you it's a plus that it came with heavy servings of protein!<br><br>The bus stop is in front of the restaurant if you're thinking of taking public transportation. If not, there are plenty of paid to park street parking.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "A must for great sushi and BYOB in Chicago!!<br>I really loved it here. BYOB and amazing sushi? Yes please.<br>I decided to check this place out due to the many positive yelp reviews and of course the really cool decorative designs on the plates in the photos others have posted. Our server was very friendly and gave us recommendations when we had a hard time choosing between the many appealing rolls. Since we can get basic rolls anywhere, my fiancé and I decided to stick with the jumbo special rolls. We ordered a few but my favorites were the breaking bad roll and the #thuglife2. <br>It was just great quality sushi. Very fresh with unique flavor combinations. I especially loved all of the yummy additions on top of the rolls. And it's an added bonus that they create fun designs with various colored sauces on the plate. It really makes for a fun experience. Little details like that really set this place apart from other sushi restaurants in the city. It's a small space and pretty packed so definitely make a reservation just incase.

Good thing we made reservations because the place is small and there was a long wait. We were seated within 10 minutes of our party arriving. The table was really small but we made do with what they had. We ordered a variety of items but my favorite was the udon noodle and the motown effect roll. <br><br>The udon noodle dish was a soup with teriyaki chicken. The broth for the soup tasted like a combination of a miso and teriyaki, it was quite delicious. The udon noodles were perfectly cooked, soft but not mushy.<br><br>The sushi rolls come out on wooden boards with extravagant designs. They are what you'd call instagramable. My favorite, The motown effect roll, was about 10 large pieces. I usually don't like rolls with a tempura coating or that are fried but this was a very light coating. The crunchy tempura and the soft rice were a delightful combination. The sushi itself was really fresh and plentiful in the roll.<br><br>Overall it's a really good sushi place but really small and packed. I'd recommend checking it out on a weekday when its a little less busy and you're not seated so close to the party next to you.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Excellent sushi. Great service.

It's tart taste sets it part from other fruit.<br><br>This place is casual, trendy, and lively with vibrant and refined food. Perfect for groups of two. Fills up fast due to smaller dining area.

We ordered fast to be considerate of the lunch time. The Goyza was average but great. My husband ordered the Bento Sushi (3pcs nigiri or sashimi, 8pcs spicy tuna maki, mixed greens, miso soup). He said the sashimi was very good. I tried some of the miso soup, which I absolutely loved! No shortage of nori or tofu bits. I ordered the Chicago Spring- Jumbo Roll $17 (shrimp tempera, avocado, cream cheese, sweet soy sauce). The presentation of this Roll is the most elaborate, colorful, and unique I have EVER seen.

I had been wanting to come here since a year ago, after reading about it in a couple articles. I was excited when I first stepped in, looking at other people's food. However, we were a bit turned off because we had made a reservation for 4 and three of us were there already, yet they wouldn't seat us. It didn't make sense because our table was just sitting there, not like we were taking anyone else's table. Make it clear that you will not be seated until your full party is present. Their waiting area is also really small so it really wasn't ideal not to seat us. <br><br>Finally seated, we really enjoyed the names of the jumbo rolls and were able to choose one each. I ordered the #thuglife2, while my friends ordered sea smoke, sin nombre, and the riverwalk. What I ordered ended up being my favorite because I love the combination of salmon, avocado, and ikura. There was also salmon skin inside which added a nice crunch to it - it actually came as a surprise to me because of how crunchy it was! I also enjoyed the albacore off the sin nombre. Our party of 4 all wished that there was more yuzu included in the menu. Since the restaurant is called yuzu, we thought there was going to be more yuzu infused into the different menu items and were a bit disappointed when there weren't.

I should have ordered two of these instead of the scallops. They even fried the head! 5/5<br>Tuna Truffle (2 pcs) $13 - They ran out of the holy hotategai so the waitress recommended this dish instead.

The fish they put onto the rice is very generous!  Of course then, between the rice and fish is the wasabi paste. This step is vital because that little punch of wasabi elevates the flavor. <br>This is how the authentic Japanese make their nigiri. <br><br>So... pretty much every nigiri we tried was amazing!

It was just amazing well put together, and I'll definitely have to comeback to have it again.<br><br>Although my experience at Yuzu was great there was a few things that did fall to hit that 5 star rating.  First, I didn't care for the appetizers, we tried 2 things and both were just nominal.  And secondly was the sauce flavor, I loved the sauce as a visual component, but I wish the flavors varied.  To me all the sauces, although different colored, were the same (just a form of eel sauce).  It wasn't bad, but I felt that they could have created different sauces to enhance the different flavor of the different sushi rolls.  For some of the rolls, I just didn't care for the sauce, but then again that's personal preference.  <br><br>To sum it all up, I truly did enjoy my experience at Yuzu, and I will be returning.  The combination of flavors and visually striking sushi roll make for such a unique experience that it would be a shame not to go back to.  So if you want a food experience, check Yuzu out.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZRjJ5wVU53PqinWhjJCvcw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Dragon ball roll"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/D9t_6lwCpM1JDgpKcKqGdg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Rainbow"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "This is a very cool place to go to if you love sushi and a laid back atmosphere.

Went with some friends on a friday night who had the foresight to make a reservation. It was super crowded so wouldn't suggest trying to walk in on the weekend. Its a BYO which is something to keep in min, and there is a corkage fee but I dont think we were actually charged anything. They do have a \"one bottle per two people\" rule which seemed to be ... loosely enforced... but it was super busy so not sure if that applies all the time. Walls are decorated with Naruto themed murals and such which is kinda funky and fun.<br><br>The Rolls are HUGE and really well priced for the size. You're probably getting 2x the amount of food of a regular roll, and then you wont end up spending too much at the end of the night with the BYO situation. Summer Breeze and Ocean roll was great, so was the Breaking Bad. A bunch of my friends got the Midwest roll which is like deep fried with cream cheese or something (thank god there was no ranch involved); not my cup of tea but they thought it was awesome. On top of that everything is plated beautifully.

I ordered some food for the whole table with the expectation that the food would be served after everyone shows up. Instead the miso soups were served instantly, after which I told the waiting staff to hold off the rest of the appetizers until everyone arrives. That didn't help - the rest of the appetizers showed up on our table shortly. Fortunately the rest of the party arrived soon after (so no one got to eat cold soup) but still, this seemed like a simple thing to get right that they missed. <br><br>To their credit, the service did improve as the evening went on. Still it left much to be desired. Also, they refused to serve the wine we brought even though they charge a corkage fee - it's a small service they could've provided and I thought that policy strange.<br><br>Second - the food. The miso soup was fine, beef short rib appetizer was good, but the rolls were less good. Too much non-essential stuff was added to the fish+rice to the point that the taste of the fish got obliterated by all the side additions and the heavy mayo-based sauces.

Downside; the table we were placed at are cramped next to other patrons and the tables are TINY. I understand why (more tables, more customers), but I literally hate this kind of arrangement. We were literally having lunch with the people next to us. Luckily, one of the tables was just finishing up their meal, so we were able to slightly scooch over, and place some of the unnecessary sauces and plates on the other table so we had more room for, again, sushi art... and elbows. <br><br>WE ORDERED to start, \"the salmon to die for\" - we didn't die over it, but it was dece, and also the the bacon scallop skewer, but they didn't bring this out until after our sushi, so weird timing, and this was also just okay. <br><br>THEN WE ORDERED the \"over the rainbow\" roll and the \"sin nombre\". <br><br>SIDE NOTE, order the special jumbo rolls, don't be that person who orders the \"ordinary\" rolls. This place is not a basic roll kind of joint. Pay the extra $6-$8 and get yourself something beautiful AND tasty. It's definitely worth the experience. <br><br>Over the Rainbow was AMAZING. It looked cool, it was fresh, and that SAUCE. Even the BFF was stealing some of that sauce for her roll. And not going to lie, the people next to us who were eating their basic rolls were definitely eyeing this roll and most likely regretting their ordering decisions.<br><br>Sin Nombre not so great. Sauce was ordinary, roll was blah, and the design was.. confusing? Art man.....<br><br>As of right now, sticking with 3 stars, but definitely willing to go back to try the other Jumbo rolls, and hopefully change my rating.<br><br>OH before I forget - though we are fast eaters generally speaking, we were in and out in less then 20 minutes.

I'm allergic to avocado so my boyfriend asked if they could make the rolls without avocado. He said, yes so my boyfriend followed up by asking what would be good without avocado. The waiter just repeated, \"We can make anything without avocado\" so my boyfriend rephrased the question and the waiter again gave the same response and this time in a rude tone and with attitude. I finally chimed in and said, \"No, he is asking for a recommendation. What do you think would still taste good without avocado?\" he finally pointed at two rolls and then walked away. It was really uncomfortable. <br><br>Finally, my boyfriend put it was my birthday in the reservation and while there we saw our waiter bring out a sushi roll with a candle to another table.

I loved the tempura sweet potato and philly rolls I got, as well as the spicy tuna and other assorted rolls the table had ordered (one was ENORMOUS and had cilantro in it, I can't remember the name but it was amazing!). I also ordered the My Favorite Midwest - tuna, avocado, cream cheese, jalapeño, scallions, masaga, and spicy mayo tempura fried and served warm with Yuzu sauce. I wanted to love this but the frying made it weird. I usually love tempura but this felt heavier, almost like it was in a cornmeal batter. The edamame we got was spicy and fun - a twist on a sushi restaurant classic. The presentation was exquisite, the food was fast and delicious, and the service was fine.

The Tuna Truffle was delicious - rice was lightly warmed, truffle was very aromatic, and long cut of tuna with great color served at a perfect temperature.

Riverwalk roll was great, lots of fish and fillings with a good crunchy texture and a little kick from the jalepeno. \"Ocean\" roll was average - whitefish on the top was a bit chewy, and extremely spicy!

If you have a friend who drinks hard anything (we brought whiskey for a couple of the people), that's a no go. <br><br>And then, the important stuff. The food! I find their maki rolls to be just okay. And holy rice explosion, Yuzu uses a lot of rice in their makis. Their non-sushi food I've had has been great, though.<br>+Sweet Potato Roll $7 - Tempura-ed sweet potato in a pretty basic roll. This is one of my go to rolls. Liked it, didn't love it. <br>+Boston Roll $10 - A lot of rice and a ton of tempura crumbs on the outside. Though some may love that, I didn't care for it. This roll was filled with tuna, avocado, chili sauce, masago & mayo. Sounded like a tasty roll and it was okay, but nothing I'd get again.<br>+Motown Effect $16 - smoked salmon, unagi, kani kama, cream cheese, avocado, jalapeno, spicy mayo, sweet soy sauce, scallion and topped with red tobiko then lightly battered in tempura. This roll was a beast! I really don't know if you could possibly throw more ingredients in a roll! Even with all that, liked it, wasn't in love with it and would try a different roll next time.<br>+Tator Tots $8 - Best thing I've had at Yuzu! They have some togarashi, truffle and garlic aioli and come in a good sized portion. They honestly could use just a bit more of the aioli to ensure there is enough for all the tots but overall a good dish.<br><br>I've been to Yuzu a few times now to get their awesome sushi sauce art. You have to order their jumbo rolls and I've now tried 4 different ones and never got some cool peacock or tiger like I've seen on Instagram. I always get this swooshy kind of brown rainbow.

Umm, no? You're the business, you're supposed to figure out the management), it ended rather pleasant. <br><br>I am a huge \"aesthetics\" person, and I loved the atmosphere and vibe of the restaurant. The walls had a Dragon Ball Z theme and the ashy wooden tables harmoniously complimented the darker anterior of the dimly lit room. It has a community-cafeteria set-up where there is one long bench against the wall and multiple tables placed alongside it. There are 4-person tables next to the sushi bar as well. Because the restaurant is a bit small, you have to get a little cozy with your neighbors - so conversation is not always private. Personally, I do not prefer this. I like not having to squeeze in between people to get to my seat. And more arm room is never bad room. Note: I recommend making a reservation because tables fill up quick. <br><br>I ordered the Dragon Ball and Riverwalk Rolls. Oh, man. It was hands down one of the best sushi rolls I have ever laid my eyes on and, well... put in my mouth. The Dragon Ball contains shrimp tempura and unagi, etc. The Riverwalk contained super tuna and cilantro, etc. Have you ever eaten sushi and everything just tasted the same - i.e. sushi buffets. Yuzu sushi is amazing - all flavors were so distinct. I could taste all the different flavors and meats. I can definitely taste the thought that was put into each roll. Everything compliments each other. Not to mention, the chefs drew beautiful, colorful designs with their dipping sauce onto the plate (I think unagi or shrimp sauce??). The sauces do not overpower the sushi roll when eaten together. Note: I ordered a side of chili powder and mixed it with my soy sauce - DELICIOUSLY SPICY. <br><br>Service was perfect for the most part - very friendly and attentive. <br><br>Bathrooms made me giggle.

The rolls at Yuzu have gotten so big and not as tightly rolled, so it has been a messy eating experience.  Making sushi is such an art.  In Japan, people literally spend 10 years perfecting their sushi making skills, and it is starting to feel like Yuzu is compromising on the skills part for quantity which isn't always a good thing.  Trust me, I love rice, but I don't want to bite into a hunk of rice.

We eat a lot of sushi back home in CA but never had or heard of \"white tuna\" before. So we decided to try out one of their rolls with it (a lot of their rolls on the menu have it) and we were not fans. It had a strange chewy texture and was in too big of chunks. I only shared two rolls with my boyfriend and we got to the point where we just had to stop eating because the texture was too much. I also just wanted a small side salad because I was in need of some greens and knew I wouldn't be able to finish an entree size. But the server said they didn't have it as an option.

All the pictures of their sushi looked amazing. The menu offerings sound delicious and the 4-5 star reviews seemed to back all the excellent ratings. So I bookmarked Yuzu with the hopes that my experience would be the same. <br><br>My husband and I had arrived 15 minutes late to our dinner reservation so I had Ben call them en route to let them know we were going to be behind. They were kind enough to hold our spot so that was much appreciated.<br><br>At 6:15, our party of two finally arrives. We get seated at a tiny table. (Unfortunately there's no booth seating here). I sat on their communal bench along the wall, Ben sat across from me in a stylish yet uncomfortable metal chair. On top of that, our table was wobbly. I didn't mind it too much but it was bothering the hell out of my husband. Our water cups begin to splash all over as he sets his arms off the sides of the table. This incident alone already sparked a not so great first impression. I had to use my linen napkin to sop the water from the table while the waiter stood by; clearly seeing all this was happening. He never bothered to step in and at least acknowledge the problem. Only after my husband requested a change in table, did they finally correct this issue.<br><br>Anyways, onto our meals. We ordered 2 sushi rolls. The Dopest (a signature roll), and their spicy scallop. I'm the type that likes to look at the menu way before arriving to the restaurant and at first, the Dopest sounded promising. It had spicy tuna, Chipolte ranch, sliced pears, and I'm sure I'm leaving out some essential ingredients here, but it was topped off with slices of scallop and foie gras. I never had foie gras before so I thought, \"What the hell.... We're here, why not give it a try?\" So we ordered it. As usual, my attempt at trying the complex and fancy bit me in the ass. There's just too much going on in this roll. Perhaps I don't have a complex or sophisticated enough palette, but the pears weren't necessary here. In addition<br>to this, I had a texture issue with the roll. Foie gras with scallops although great individually, didn't seem to blend well with this roll. First of all, its slimy and very fatty. I didn't like it. <br><br>The spicy scallop roll and the premium steak teriyaki were enjoyable. These were worth ordering. <br><br>There's mouthwash in the bathroom so if you want to freshen up after you had your meal, it's there for your convenience. Be careful not to confuse the mouthwash pump for soap. It's an easy rookie mistake.<br><br>Street parking only and the meters as of 12/2016 are $2.00/hour.<br><br>It's a decent place but I don't think it's worth a return visit.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1KHVwrtLEgaI-vswMUS7DA/348s.jpg", "caption": "Close up cross section of the Dopest.

As for their lunch specials, most of their box options included spicy tuna; it was sad that no other sushi was offered because their tuna isn't good. Overall, this place is not terrible but expensive, nor is it impressively tasty but average. And also, I think this place is more concerned about the size of the sushi than the quality. I couldn't really enjoy the taste because I was too busy not trying to choke.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I eat sushi and/or poke multiple times a week and Yuzu has the best of the best!  I like to branch out and order something new every time I go because their menu has a lot more than just sushi. <br><br>Sushi Rolls: The jumbo rolls all come on a wooden board with an intricate sauce design, I think everyone should experience it at least once! The sushi is so beautiful that it made my Facebook profile picture. Not only does the sauce look exquisite, but its taste compliments the roll. It can be spicy, sweet, savory, or anything in between depending on what roll you order. As for the rolls themselves, if any of them are listed as spicy, you have the option to get a non-spicy version. My favorite jumbo roll is the Motown Effect because it's deep fried and has all my favorite ingredients: salmon, cream cheese, avocado, and spicy mayo (also comes with eel, kani kama, and a few other typical sushi fillings). It's a lot to stomach and really fills you up so I would only order if you're pretty hungry. My other go-to's are the River Walk and Picasso because they are loaded with fresh fish (I'm generally not a fan of shrimp, so each roll that I've mentioned doesn't contain shrimp).<br><br>My favorite non-sushi item is the udon noodle soup served with mixed tempura. I have gotten it to share with my boyfriend as a kind of appetizer/side dish. It comes with giant shrimp, carrot, zucchini, and broccoli tempura which have the perfect crunch but don't taste greasy or unhealthy like some other places. The soup has a lot of amazingly thick udon noodles that are a struggle to get on a spoon; but the taste is worth the challenge! I definitely recommend it as an add-on to the sushi. <br><br>Dessert: One time my friend and I received a complimentary dessert (assorted mochi) because they forgot to serve her food without sesame, like she asked. Of course they quickly brought out new rolls but the free mochi was a great touch and the servers were genuinely sorry about the mistake. We had lychee and strawberry flavors and it was super refreshing after the giant meal. <br><br>The atmosphere is lively but intimate. They have rap music playing but it's not overbearing, there's anime art on the walls that's really cool to look at, and the lighting is dim without obstructing visibility of anything. The tables are kind of close together, but I usually go with one other person and it's like you're in your own world of sushi together even though it's usually packed. The servers are polite and efficient- so efficient to the point where they clarify how long you will be dining there so that their reservations run smoothly and they avoid overbooking. I would definitely make a reservation if you want to go after 6 pm. <br><br>They have street parking and it's not hard to find (you might have to walk a block or two). It's free on Sundays!<br><br>One more thing: it's BYOB; they don't serve alcohol.

The place was so a live with conversation, with laughter, every table I gazed at looked like they were enjoying themselves! The great atmosphere definitely set the mood, I knew we were in for an amazing night!<br><br>When our server came over she was so sweet and kind! You can't fake the service she put out, she added to the enjoyment of our night! With 4 hungry men at the table and 1 gorgeous woman, we all have different tastes and to say the least our table was expecting a significant amount food! Our server handled our orders well, with 5 different picky requests and needs, everyone ordered knowing exactly what to expect.<br><br>I should mention that I am a Strict Vegetarian and it was great to see I had so many choices to choose from. It's great knowing that my food restrictions did not get in the way of the evening! I got exactly what I wanted, the Asparagus Roll (Tempura, special request), Sweet Potato Tempura Roll, and a double order of the Robata Tofu! They've got a great menu with so many choices, they have something for everyone! And if you need to tweak something, don't hesitate to ask, Yuzu is very accommodating!!! <br><br>Everyone at the table was pretty amazed at the rate our orders were being brought out. We didn't wait long and I was expecting and prepared (because it was busy) to wait a while. Another great plus about Yuzu is the BYOB factor, while we waited for our food we were enjoying our ice cold beers!  Everything was great! We enjoyed the cool atmosphere (great music play list that night), the food was delicious, and the service was impeccable! <br><br>I totally recommend Yuzu Sushi & Robata Grill for a night out! Great place for an intimate date with your loved one and a perfect place to meet with a group of friends (they've got the space for it)! The food is so intricately prepared, the presentation is almost too pretty to mess up by digging in, and more importantly everything is delicious! They have definitely gained another client, I loved my experience and totally intend to come back for more!

The tempura was super light and flaky, and all the flavors went nicely together- the heat from the jalapeño paired really well with the cream cheese and smoked salmon. So good!<br>Avocado and cucumber- like the smoked salmon, just the avocado and cucumber with rice inside the nori. Pretty good, but if you're going to go vegetarian, we recommend the jumbo rolls that pack more of a punch. <br>Coconut and crab- (jumbo) soft shell crab, unagi, avocado, cream cheese, topped with coconut flakes. Never had this combo before but dang was it good! Coconut and sushi? Not a combo I would have thought of but I'm really glad Yuzu did. <br>Green Harbor- (jumbo) vegetarian roll with avocado, tempura broccoli and sweet potato, and cucumber. The broccoli was a little strong and made it harder to taste everything in the roll, but still a really option for vegetarians. <br>Service was good and the staff was really nice!

Why, you may ask or not? <br><br>Miso soup came bland and watered down and when I shared this feedback with at least 2 individuals, their response was less than stellar - one mentioned how the miso paste must have got left at the bottom of the pot when it was ladled into my bowl, while the other claim that a lot of folks prefer their miso soup 'less intense and bland' , really? <br><br>We had a vegetarian friend visiting from NY join us and we had got her to Yuzu the last time she was visiting in May. She had absolutely loved her Green Dragon roll on her last visit so she got it again this time but it wasn't anywhere close to the quality of taste she remembered. On the contrary, it was dry because they missed the spicy mayo, a key ingredient in the roll. She had to ask for it on the side. Once again, our feedback fell on deaf ears and all we got back in response was defensive excuses. Everyone has a bad day, so Yuzu can you too but pony up and accept feedback, rather than defend and deny. I offered our server to try both the soup and roll, but she declined :). <br><br>We also ordered a piece of masago and unlike previous occasions it wasn't topped to the brim.

The manga walls esp. the DBZ one were pretty neat. It was very loud in there though and not because of the music or people. Every noise just kinda echoed and stayed in the place, so it wasn't the best place to converse.<br><br>We got the avocado mango salad, baked mushroom, sweet potato fries, and a wagyu beef app to start. The salad was good with the dressing being quite tasty. The mushrooms were yummy and flavorful as well. The mini beef skewers had gold flakes on top which were cool. These were also good but the flavors did not quite suit my preference. It was a little too punchy/gingery for my liking. The fries were surprisingly good. They were reminiscent of churros but were not overly sweet.<br><br>I got the #thuglife2, summer breeze & ocean, and a very spicy tuna maki rolls. All of our food came out pretty quick. We were lucky to have an empty table next to us since we ordered so much food. To note though, each roll comes out on one plaque of wood, since they beautifully design each one with sauces. Their signature rolls are massive! Their rice to fish ratios are still appropriate though. With even having a big appetite like myself, I recommend only getting two rolls pp, with one of them possibly being a regular roll which are smaller (e.g. very spicy tuna).<br><br>The notable designs on the dishes were a crab, squid, and a bird. These were super awesome and definitely makes Yuzu a standout. However, I can't say that the sushi itself was all that memorable. The rice especially was disappointing. It lacked the traditional sushi rice taste. Perhaps, some more vinegar or sugar could have been used. The fish and rest of the flavors were fine. <br><br>Our service was top notch. Our sever was very helpful and tended to us regularly. The whole staff was efficient and friendly.<br><br>On another note, I got a sushi burrito from Yuzu via Ubereats some time ago. This was probably the best one I've had so far in regards to the sushi burrito concept. It held together well and had a good amount of avocado and tuna. However, the wrap they used was sweet and reminded me of a fruit leather, which I did not quite enjoy.<br><br>Overall, Yuzu wouldn't be a top choice to go for a sushi craving but I might come back if already in the area and want something that is Instagram worthy.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Just came here today for the first time and all I can say is wow!

Anyways...<br><br>Got edamame and seaweed salad for appetizers, which were a thumbs up. Good amount for the price you pay.<br><br>My friend ordered a 12-piece sashimi plate. The fish was very fresh and did not have any fishy taste to them. The seared albacore tuna was weird tasting--wasn't sure if it was just me not liking how they taste or they did something weird to the outside when they seared it.

Everything tasted fresh and we would definitely order those rolls again.<br>Sadly, the special and jumbo rolls were not the greatest. At least in my opinion. Being a California native who's been a bit spoiled with sushi, I look for special rolls that have some extra flavors but still can get the taste of the fish inside. None of the special rolls offered in the menu were like that. They had too many ingredients in each roll and I felt like half of them have cream cheese in them, which in my honest opinion shouldn't be in sushi :P Based on the special roll items alone, it was just very Americanized/contemporary, which kind of takes away the Japanese in sushi. We ended up trying Sin Nombre and River Walk. The sauce on the side of River Walk was awesome, I dipped all of my sushi in that. But the rolls themselves were just funky tasting. The Sin Nombre had a weird citrus taste to them that was overpowering, and had I known the seared albacore tuna had a weird taste I wouldn't have ordered it. River Walk had a bit too much wasabi ingredients in them.<br><br>If I were to go again when I'm in Chicago, I would only get their basic rolls. They were amazing. But the special ones? Not really.

The food is delicious and the ambiance is hipster chic at its finest. I have tried multiple rolls and they never disappoint. Not only is the food scrumptious, but the presentation is unmatched by anything I've ever seen. Intricate and colorful designs, made from sauces, are displayed with your sushi. If you order the \"Chicago roll\" you will get a Chicago skyline made out of spicy mayo and food dye. <br><br>One of my favorite aspects of Yuzu is the fact that it's BYOB. However, don't try to break their alcohol rule because they won't allow it. One bottle of wine per 2 people. If you are a beer drinker, I believe you can bring a six pack per 2 people. <br><br>With this being said, Yuzu has become one of my favorite date night spots and just a great place in general for different vibes and great food. However, I will never recommend Yuzu again. Please read on if you'd like to know why. <br><br>The alcohol rule is annoying, and so is the fact that they try to rush you and turn over tables quickly. However, the customer service at Yuzu is the reason why I will not recommend this restaurant. Their customer service is the worst I have ever seen. I worked in the restaurant industry for two summers in college, and I have seen what good customer service is. I am also a frequent restaurant goer and have experienced poor customer service. The way the manager at Yuzu treated me, was unacceptable. <br><br>Since Yuzu is quite small, I made sure to call early to book my birthday dinner. I called on January 3rd to make a reservation for 10 people for February 24th. I specifically asked if any tables would fit 10 people and they said it wouldn't be a problem. I assumed that they would put two tables together or that they had a table large enough for 10. <br><br>The day before my reservation, I didn't hear anything from the restaurant. I figured I should call to confirm. The manager wasn't in and contrary to what the host told me, the manager didn't get back to me when she said she would. I ended up calling three times, and emailing, to finally get ahold of the manager.

Not only were all of our platters delicious, the artwork was so perfect I didn't even want to touch the food. <br><br>For an appetizer I ordered the chicken satay. If I had any issue with Yuzu it was the fact that I paid $3+ dollars for one skewer of marinated chicken. That is crazy. I visit other places in Chinatown and you get 3 for $4-$5. However. The chicken was SUPERB. I loved the sauce they put on top. It was sweet but curry infused I think.<br><br>For sushi I ordered the Motown Effect. Upon first bite, my eyes literally rolled to the back of my head. The smoked salmon mixed with the creamy cream cheese and avocado, paired with the eel and jalapeños, and spicy mayo...seriously, orgasmic. It was spicy. It was love. It was life. Whoever thought of the ingredients to be in this roll, I love you. My friends wanted to sample each others rolls. The Chicago spring roll was great too. Nowhere near as great as my Motown effect. The pier 69 was interesting. I was not a huge fan of it. Maybe because of the crab. Definitely because of all the crab. Had the main ingredient been shrimp in the Pier 69 roll instead of crab, I would have loved it because it of the coconut flakes. <br><br>I had no issue with the service.

Even though this place is very American, as it caters to American tastes, I still thought the food was delicious, high quality and unique. The rolls are fantastic, not a single one I didn't like. We ordered the spicy tuna, sweet potato, Midwest, and another roll with cream cheese. I like trying vegetarian rolls because restaurants should make sure their non carnivorous customers aren't miserable. I really liked the the sweet potato roll because it was fried just enough and was seasoned well-it wasn't just plain potato. My spicy tuna was mild at best for obvious reasons, but it was still delicious. Midwest roll had a great amount of crunch and flavor and I loved that they put the sauce on the side rather than dousing the roll. Most other American sushi places do this and it's overkill.

I know this is their thing, and it is as cool in person as it looks in the pictures. The BYOB part of this place also makes it awesome. No corkage fee. How can it get any better? <br><br>We got the smallest sashimi platter, it was very good. I recommend sharing this, it also is packed with rice. Enough for 3/4 people if you get it as an app. Also tried the pork robata and it was amazing, well worth the $4 for an order. <br><br>The sushi rolls are large and filling. Every single of of them was delicious. Even the sweet potato roll knocked it out of the park. Mo-Town was for sure the favorite, and Dragon. We had the Breaking Bad too. Nothing against the flavor but it was so big you had to eat it in pieces. We had a few others that were great.<br><br>The service could have been improved. Our waitress looked flustered and overworked. Nothing against her, she was cool. But we waited a while for simple orders such as water or a bottle opener. Maybe it was a rough night.

They took down my name and number and said I would get a text when a table is ready.

The shrimp was an interesting flavor of lemony and saltiness. I really like the unique flavor. There were 4 skewers of shrimp so it was perfect for my party of 4. The chicken was good but nothing unique. The bacon wrapped asparagus was my favorite! And the asparagus was huge so they definitely aren't cheap on this.<br><br>The black sea roll has a nice kick to it, definitely the spiciest of the 4 rolls I had. This is one of the smaller roll.<br><br>The motown was the biggest roll of the night, and you get a good 10 piece/roll. I really like the design of this, it looked like an art piece. I enjoyed this roll but honestly don't remember the specific details of it except it was a bit creamy from the cream cheese.<br><br>The midwest favorite was similar to the motown in the cheesy aspect. This is the smallest roll out of the 4. Nothing too special about this.<br><br>The monster spider is like any other spider rolls other sushi place offers.<br><br>This is a BYOB place so feel free to bring your drinks.<br><br>I would definitely come back because it is affordable sushi and good quality.

If you enjoy a more Japanese style of sushi look elsewhere as it doesn't seem like they provide much in terms of nigiri and sashimi, though they did have a chirashi bowl. The appeal of this place is that on their jumbo rolls, they present a really elaborate and colorful sauce. Depending on the dish, you get a different design that they draw out. I do love the fact that they use manga as decorations on their walls. <br><br>The menu provides different categories of sushi and other Japanese dishes. A couple noodle dishes. Robata which is grilled food. And then there's the standard rolls and jumbo rolls. <br><br>For my visit, i came with a group of four. I made a reservation the day of but when I got there at 8pm on a weekday, the place seemed like it was dying down in numbers. For our table we ordered 4 jumbo rolls, one regular roll, and one poke dish. Our four jumbo rolls all came with the pretty sauce designs you see from the photos, and each came with an assortment of raw fish. In all honesty though after trying all the rolls, my friends and I all came to the conclusion that it all tasted the same. The unique flavor of whatever fish that was included was lost either by the combination of other raw fish or by the amount of toppings and sauces they put in. At the end of the day you get raw fish with sauce flavor. That being said, all the sushi was fresh and I didn't feel like they were trying to cheapen up by stuffing their rolls with unreasonable amounts of rice.

We got there in 8, 9 minutes tops, the receptionist and manager said we got there in longer than 10.  My advice to you is, come here for the food if you can stand the service, which is easily among the worst I've ever seen, and I'm from China, where service is still a developing concept.<br><br>P.S. I was obviously quite ticked off about being lied to regarding our arrival times.  I straight up said to check the camera and put down a $2,500 wager and see who's right.  I'm cool if they said gambling is against the rules here, but I'm not cool with them saying they don't have time for that.  Don't have time to earn $2,500 on something you're that sure about?  Business must be even better than it looks.<br><br>Edit after the comment posted by Yuzu:  lol wait what, WE raising our voice..

And that's across different types of restaurants.  For any owner that we know to find out that their customers were treated as we have would have been nothing short of appalling.  Again, I respect that your \"industry\" or \"company culture\" may be different, but our expectation of customer service is all but ubiquitous of the general public.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Disappointed!

When we arrived, exactly when they opened (before the place got crowded), the staff refused to sit our two parties adjacent to each other, even though they had booths and tables available that could easily accommodate all of us. We didn't ask to push tables together, we just wanted to sit NEXT to each other, since we were there to celebrate a birthday, after all!  But no, they insisted on seating our groups ACROSS the restaurant from each other, as if to make a point to be rude and unaccommodating to us.

I also liked the sweet ebi which was done two ways (one fried, one as-is with a ton of little orange fish eggs). BYOB is great, and service is good too. They aren't pushy to turn tables which is surprising, but nice. My only reason I can't give it 5 stars is that I've yet to enjoy a single maki roll in my 2 visits. I found the 4 I've tried to be overly mayo-y or fried, and I also don't like that the vast majority of the specialty maki rolls all come loaded with raw jalepeño, which isn't for me. The robata was delicious. Chicken was tasty. The maple bacon quail egg is something to get if you air on the trendy side. Despite all the hipster trendiness here,  I always have a great experience.

Another 25 mins we were seated, next to the service station and a couple of women talking about explicit sexual acts. We were reseated with no problem however. For our \"mix up\" and wait we were given comp edamame. Only about 3 had salt on them, they were in a plastic to go container, and pretty flavorless. The waiter recommended me a roll, and my company ordered the california roll and robata. <br>The food came out very fast which was a positive. What I was brought was a roll (over the rainbow) covered in so much goop and sauce that I was automatically skeptical. I tried 1 piece.....I noticed something off. I dissected the second piece. The fish was warm, fishy smelling and slimey. I felt all the sauce was to cover up the quality of the fish. It took almost 20 mins to send the roll back. I was not offered anything but a remake of the same roll. I declined. <br>After having to wait 2 hours to eat, yell over very loud music, being packed like a sardine in a small space, being severed food that was not up to par, and having poor customer service the whole experience I was done. Thank goodness for the robata or I would not have had any dinner at all. <br>I had to ask for the check several times, to the point I was waving money in the air to get the attention of anyone.

I ended up for two days being very ill after eating 2 pieces of a sushi roll. I was treated in a way that both my date and I were extremely uncomfortable, and can not believe I bought in to the hype. I was on a date with someone that owns a restaurant, grew up in a restaurant, and his whole family are restaurant people. I was embarrassed I suggested this place. Save your money and go to Arami or Union. Somewhere that you will be treated better. <br>I was told by a worker that Thai people are very curt and profile people.

Over my years of restaurant journeying I have learned a bit and I was in the industry for quiet some time. Now I hard about this place from a friend. I called in for reservations and the gentleman on the phone said instead of a 7 o'clock he had a 9 oclock. Well to late for me but then he quickly said, well I have a 6:30 opening but need the table back at 7:30. An hour for sushi, plenty of time. Glad took the reservation and quickly jumped in the car to head south. I live in North center sk new it would be a drive to get there. I got there on the dot at 6:30. Nows where they earned their 5 stars. <br><br>See my wife asked if we could be seated and the guy asked for the info and then stated \"oh I am sorry your table was given away. We notified you about it through text\". Now I know a lot of restaurants like this new technology yet they must understand not everyone is aware they use it and it was not told to me. I never check my phone while driving, if you didn't know it illegal and unsafe. Now my wife said it's ok, we will just go some where else. I turned and started to walk away as it seemed the guy didn't care. <br><br>Thought about it for 2 seconds and thought no! No way this is not my mistake. I know they said 6:30 and I was here. I spoke with the guy at the check in and he seemed really not to care (seemed). I requested in talk to a manager as o know what i was told regardless of what some text was after I was finished making the reservation. Clearly I was no aware that's how they confirmed things. After some what going back and forth with him I requested to speak with a manager. <br><br>The manager comes over and I update her with what has happened. Told her I am not hear to ramble on about what happened but would like it fixed. I know they said 6:30 and that it is ridiculous to think they would make me aware of needing the table back after an hour and half. I know as I have been a restaurant manager for years. I also stated you should have the person make new people aware, I am gonna send you a text confirming your reservation so please confirm your information. <br><br>All in all she quickly handled the situation politely and got us a table right away. Food was amazing, service was great, can't say enough about presentation. Though I will say this; being from LA I have high standards of sushi. Chicago places usually tend to be over priced for minimal portions. This place is nothjng like that.

Regardless, I ordered two orders of the short rib (seemed to be a Yelp favorite), and three sushi rolls (black sea, what's my name,and chicago spring). The short rib was quite good: flavorful, tender, well cooked. With that being said, its $3.50 for one skewer of short rib (yes, one skewer), and the quality did not justify the pricing. The sushi, which is what I truly came for, was unimpressive. I wanted to like the sushi, but was legitimately underwhelmed. The fish did not seem fresh, nor did the flavor \"wow\" me.

What I love about Yuzu is the lighting, and the Anime looking graphics on the wall, called Manga art, created by Mangaka. They both seem to play off of each other. The lighting is warm, slow, and intimate; while the art seems impersonal and highly active, creating drama while everyone dining is clearly trying to relax. To boost the irony, the restaurant is always busy. What's nice is that the tables are spaced far enough away from each other, giving you ample elbow room to effectively use your chopsticks to grasp a hold of that lovely sushi. As for the Robatayaki grillers.. I wasn't quite sure what the most polite way was to eat this moist and tasty meat on a stick. I wanted to pick it up and eat the meat directly from the skewer, but I saw my friend using chopsticks to separate it away. <br>I just loved the busy restaurant because I had my own space to sit back and enjoy it. It was super noisy, but the music wasn't too loud, so the noise level stayed tolerable. The music was excellent, mostly hip hop from the early 90's which was considered \"gangster\" at the time, now is regarded as mainly a novelty. The best example: I Got 5 On It, by Luniz. If you have been messing with that \"endo weed,\" then you're really in for a treat by eating here. For as busy as Yuzu is, your food comes out promptly and the wait staff is always around if you want to order more. <br>From the Robata grill, my friend and I had the Chicken and Green Onions, Asparagus Bacon, and the Cauliflower. For the sushi rolls, we had My Favorite Midwest Roll, Fire, Unagi, and the Boston Crunchy. All of these were so good. I'd say the Boston Crunchy made the least sense to me because it had cream cheese inside of it. I've heard most Asians are lactose intolerant. The cream cheese did nothing to bring out the flavor of this roll, along with the crunchy exterior. Perhaps when you go, I'd consider ordering something else. What stood out to me the most was the Asparagus Bacon. I have never seen a restaurant do this before and which proves once more that everything tastes better with bacon!

The version served here was as delicious as I have previously had in Hawaii. Next came the brussel sprout dish that is absolutely fantastic. The fried up sprouts with bits of bacon and yellow raisins is a great combination. Why aren't brussel sprouts on more menus in Chicago? They are delicious and plentiful if you go into any market place around town. Then, the beautiful rolls started arriving at our table. The \"born to chill\" spicy tuna has just the right about amount of heat that I like. Make no mistake its spicy, and delicious.

I don't mean it as a race thing, I mean it as an authenticity thing. I'll admit, I've eaten at so many Japanese and sushi places (as it is my favorite) that I've unfortunately become a bit of a sushi snob.<br><br>I really have no idea why Yuzu has 4.5 stars on yelp. It wasn't BAD sushi, but it wasn't REAL sushi either. Just too much going on. It seems to cater more towards the younger, \"trendy\" crowd whose idea of culture involves pork gyoza and shrimp tempura platters. It was already bad enough that I opened the menu to see that they offered Vietnamese sandwiches at a sushi place, but the fact that they spelled it \"bahn mi\" just irritated me some more. To be fair, they did call it \"faux bahn mi\"...but then again, it's not difficult to google the actually spelling (banh mi) before throwing it on their menu and spreading ignorance to unbeknownst customers. <br><br>Bf and I ordered the bang bang shrimp appetizer, the boy meets world roll, the monster spider roll, the motown effect roll, and the matcha and chocolate charlotte dessert. The appetizer could have actually been my favorite part of the meal as it wasn't like your typical fried bang bang shrimp that you get at other places. It was more a minced shrimp ball (similar to the ones you'd find in dim sum) lightly fried and served with an arugula garnish glazed with a sweet spicy mayo. The rolls, while very visually appealing, left a little to be desired. The rolls were cut into huge pieces which isn't as great as it sounds since sushi is meant to be eaten in whole bites as to get the whole flavor, not cut into pieces and defeating the whole purpose. The motown effect roll was described on the menu as having \"lightly battered tempura\" but it was almost inedible. Barely any rice in the roll, and way too big and too fried to the point that it was very hard and tore up the roofs of our mouths. We ended up not finishing this roll and didn't even bother to pack it up...which has never happened before. The flavor of the rolls weren't bad, but it didn't live up to the hype of the nearly 5 stars and 45 min wait. Honestly, in a city like Chicago, you can find much better and more authentic options elsewhere. <br><br>On the plus side, the prices are fair and I really enjoyed the anime/manga wall decor. They also do a very nice \"mural\" on the sushi plates which, I assume, is the main appeal of the restaurant. If you want to have a little art with your basic sushi, then come here.

Two thumbs up for me...meats (chicken, beef, veges, seafood, cooked on a open grill) like they do in Japan as I've learned by watching No Reservations.

In fact considering that it's BYOB, I must bump up my rating and consider it a great value. The sushi was merely average, but for the price I can't complain.

Yesterday evening, we arrived at Yuzu at 9:05pm and put our name on the list. The hostess said it would be 30-40min and took my number. We went for a drink across the street and I came back an hour later to check on the table, we waited another 5 minutes or so and were seated. Fine, it's busy. So, at 10:15pm we sat down. Service was good - the server even had our sake heated for us. After ordering $150.00 worth of food, the server told us the kitchen was closing. So much for dessert, fine, no big deal. The sushi was tasty, a bit hard to eat due to the size of the rolls - the presentation was spectacular! Really well done and super fun. Then, while eating our meal, the lights got bright and the music got quiet. The server immediately came over to us, put the check down, and said they were closing. It was 11:15pm. Then, busboys came every 2 minutes to try to take our trays with rolls still on them. In addition to this, 3 separate people came over to us to tell us they were closed. It was now 11:30pm. So, we let the busboys take our unfinished sushi rolls when yet another person came to tell us they were closed - I replied and said that if they want to close at 11:30pm, they shouldn't be seating a 3-top at 10:15pm because there is not enough time to dine. At the very least, they should say they are closing at 11:30pm when we put our name on the list so we can plan accordingly. Had we known we were on a time crunch, we would have ordered faster, or less, or gone somewhere else.

It turns out one of the rolls had bacon! That's a big no no for me. I had to throw up the food in the bathroom. The one good thing was that my waiter was nice enough to make the food complimentary. He repeatedly apologized and I appreciated that. I just tipped him my bill. I'm not sure if I'd go back. Pushing through people to get out doesn't seem like my idea of fun. The place definitely looks happening. Last thing, they send you a text when they have an open spot for you but you have to show up within five minutes to get your spot.

It's still BYOB, make sure you check out the limit on how much beer and wine you can bring. They are pretty strict.<br>We decided to visit Yuzu to celebrate my birthday. Our waitress was prompt and very polite. She offered to chill our bottle of wine and beer in a rustic, ice filled bucket. FYI, there is no corkage fee, yeah!<br>We skip the soup and salads and dive right into the Sushi rolls. We order 2 per person and share. The waitress brought out wood carving boards with the rolls on display. The chefs create an artful design on the boards using colored sauces (we're not sure what it is). We've never seen these creations at other sushi joints but, were impressed with the added dimension to an otherwise boring board. The designs were specific to the rolls we ordered: flowers, a dragon, abstract, etc. Note: the food coloring used in these sauces will turn your lips and tongue blue, red or whatever color.<br>Some of our favorite rolls include: Breaking Bad, Dragon Roll, Spicy Shrimp Roll, omg! Getting hungry just writing about them. Desert is very simple at Yuzu. Which is a good idea, cause we've usually eaten so much sushi we have little room left. Desserts are ordered individually and are seasonal. This night they were serving Matcha chocolate Raspberry Mochi and simple green tea mochi's. Yum! 2 each is enough and helps get the fish breath out of your mouth. Matcha is the new powdered green tea which everyoneis going crazy over. It's been around for 100's of years, recently discovered by the 21st century.<br>The only down side to this restaurant, the food comes out too fast. We thought it might have been an anomaly the 1st time we ate at Yuzu, but it happened to us a 2nd time.

Instead of the typical more rectangular cut for the fish, the fish is sliced and presented in elongated/pointy shape which appears to look like you are getting a lot of fish.  IMO they should slice the fish a bit thicker and use the shorter more stubby cut, which IMO also makes the nigiri tastes better.

It's a small and lively space, but they get the most out of the square footage without feeling too cramped. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful. <br><br>The thing I really love about Yuzu is that they take the robata as seriously as they take the sushi. At a lot of top-notch sushi joints, it often feels like the hot items are an afterthought, tacked on for non-sushi people who've been dragged there by friends. Not so at Yuzu. All of the little grilled skewers are fantastic and well-prepared. There's a big variety, so you can pick what suits your tastes. We've had just about all of the skewers, but three of our favorites are the pork shoulder, short rib and  shishito peppers (if you've never had those, don't be scared by their appearance -- they're sweet, not hot). The salmon skewer is great too, but we have this weird thing about not getting grilled fish when we're about to eat raw fish.<br><br>They have an extensive selection of maki rolls, where again you'll certainly find something that appeals to your tastes. We're big on rolls that involve spicy and/or crunchy tuna, so we often go for the Boston Crunchy, South Beach or Over the Rainbow. If you have similar preferences, you won't be disappointed by those choices. The sashimi and nigiri are also excellent at Yuzu -- the fish is fresh and the pieces are generously sized.<br><br>Yuzu is also a great place to bring people who have never had sushi or aren't sure about it. Since they have the delicious robata as a backstop, you can ease them into the sushi by cherrypicking a couple items that make sense for a newbie without overwhelming them.<br><br>We have never been disappointed at Yuzu. It's a busy restaurant, so it's best to try and make a reservation if you can. The good news is that they're pretty good about not letting people linger over their bottle of wine after they finish eating, so even if you don't have a reservation they wait is rarely more than 30 minutes.

The guy starts talking to us and says right this way and then he sees two white guys behind us that had not been waiting as long as us and without saying anything tells them to come on and then seats them. He didn't say just a moment, we're getting your table ready cat, dog, bitch or anything to us. Then he says to us I have a table for you but you need to be done by 9:30pm (in an hour). Are you kidding me!!!!! Then I polite ask why he sat the two white gentlemen before seating us. He walks away without warning and says something to the gentlemen. He comes back and I express that that is not fair and how can we have a wait limit when he just gave our table away to someone else. He gets loud and rude. I ask for the manager. She is no better. The two of them speak to each other in front of us about us in a different language. I ask them not to do that please speak English so that we can understand, they continue in a different language (they both were able to speak perfect English). After her arguing rudely with us for 30 minutes she admits that her host was wrong but does nothing about it and is basically like fuck off. The manager then replies to this review and says we checked in late, never said that at restaurant, we were right in front of the restaurant so that was not even possible. She finally admitted they were wrong in our presence at the restaurant so to reply to this review saying otherwise is unprofessional and untrue. Just admit you made a mistake and do better for your customers. Many people have reviewed on the poor customer service so obviously that is an issue. Whether it's racial or not is immaterial, perhaps those guys were regulars I don't know, the point is that we were there first standing in the restaurant and skipped over and then given an unreasonable timetable to eat and leave their restaurant after they gave our table away to someone who came after us.

As we rolled down the street looking for the place, there was one storefront with two tables outside and an overflow of people outside... bingo, there it is! Plenty of metered street parking on a Friday night. Unless you're coming here on off hours, I highly suggest you GET A RESERVATION. We came 15 minutes early with a reservation for our anniversary on a Friday night, and were seated soon after our actual reservation, yay! <br><br>Since we were waiting, we perused the menu throughly. There is a \"Robata Grill\" section along with a couple other entrees, pieces, signature rolls, etc. The kitchen and the sushi bar are in plain view when standing (even though I'm 5'1, lol), so we could see the portion size of the grill pieces. $2 for marinated chicken? I usually eat lots of meat, but I know you can buy a whole frigging chicken instead... pass up the meat and invest in some seafood, here! <br><br>Anyway, time well spent waiting while looking at the menu (except that our BYOB wine was warm, but they supplied a bucket of ice as soon as we were seated) because we selected some rolls with generous portions of fish inside (Black Sea, Pot River). Look at the pictures on Yelp! They helped immensely and even encouraged us to get the tuna poke. Jumbo rolls were numbered at 8-9 pieces. <br><br>Basic Food Highlights:<br><br>Tuna Poke - Refreshing, huge portion I thought! Not spicy despite listing of Japanese chili pepper. Served with a whole avocado, literally. <br><br>Pot River (9 pieces) - Tuna, super white tuna, salmon. Tempura crumb (I love tempura crumb textured rolls) and probably the jalapeño made it spicier than the sauces on the side. This is LOADED with cilantro, the damn roll probably tastes like too much cilantro that it mutes everything else, but! I also love cilantro.<br><br>Black Sea (8 pieces) - tuna, super white tuna, salmon, hamachi. That's four fish in one roll! Lots of seeds, enjoyable if only for the amount inside. <br><br>Salmon x2 (6 pieces) - Not a bad portion per piece. Not loaded with rice either.<br><br>My Favorite Midwest (??? I forgot, last roll) - I think this was the only deep fried roll on the menu (I could be wrong). Cream cheese mutes the spiciness, I don't think I'd go for this next time.<br><br>PS - I checked in on Yelp! on 7/19/13 and the check in special was $10 off $50, but 20% gratuity was automatically added to the bill. OK fine, I had no qualms with that because even though the house was packed, the staff was awesome!

In one of my calls I was hung up on in the middle of giving my name and number. Definitely some issues going on here, but that's not even the half of it.<br><br>Like a few other reviewers we didn't realize Yuzu was BYOB, as we were quickly searching for sushi while on the road. Upon arriving we were a little bummed to find that they were BYOB, but the silver lining was the sake my husband found at Lush down the street. (Since I hate when people comment on liking something, but don't share the details I am listing the info for you sake lovers. This is a lovely sake to enjoy cold: Sato no Homare \"Pride of The Village\" Junmai Ginjo Sake, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan) <br><br>Back to Yuzu... we placed an order for various robata items as well as some sushi. A word of warning, the tables for two here are tiny. Since we tend to order a little bit of everything when eating somewhere new, I told the server who brought out the first few dishes (who was different from the person who took our order) that we ordered quite a bit, and asked if we could pull over a second table. There was an empty table just a couple feet away, and she proceeded to move around the vase, candle, bottle of water and four glasses on our table (two of which had water and two that were empty???) and she completely ignored my request. When she first came out with the food she stood there waiting for me to play musical chairs with all the c&@% they had littered on the table. Give me a break! It took us asking a second person when more food arrived to get another table moved over. The place was not packed, not even half full, otherwise I wouldn't have asked. Note to Restaurants: If you insist on cluttering a small table for two with junk like vases, bottles of water, extra glasses, then please add a second table! That just makes me not want to order more food.<br><br>Proceeding to the food... Robata items were VERY oily, and the zucchini was unimpressive, and barely grilled (or warm) with some sort of Thai-esque oily peanut sauce on top that looked like the consistency of gravy with corn starch. Needless to say, yuck! My sushi was just ok. The fish didn't have that melt in your mouth buttery taste & feel that good sushi should. One of my rolls came unrolled. In general the sushi on the menu was more on the fusion side with ingredients such as bacon and cream cheese, and sauces all over. Stupid me for trying this last minute and not reading more.<br><br>From start to finish this was not a good experience. I was shocked to read Andrea R's review and see that this is Sushi Wabi's chef of 7 years! I loved Sushi Wabi and this is no where near the caliber of Sushi Wabi. The staff, other than the one young twenty-something male working on the floor, were inattentive, frosty and some just plain rude. I had one woman trying to take my plate away while I still had food on it. When we tried getting some assistance, the staff were either standing around chatting at the sushi bar, or were nowhere to be found. Not impressed with the service, ambiance and definitely not the food. <br><br>Reading the reviews where the owner/staff scold former patrons for sharing their experiences is disgusting. Read some of their responses and decide if this is how you wish to spend your money and be treated. I'm sure I'll get my tongue lashing...

Neither of us had been to the restaurant before, so we were pretty blown away by the sauce art that came with the Chicago Spring roll. That being said, I didn't think either roll was that phenomenal - the Chicago Spring had some good elements but overall just felt like way too many ingredients crammed into one sushi roll, while the Sorry I am Drunk was a little too salty for my taste (but again, had some ingredients that I liked a lot).

Amazing price, and they definitely know how to grill. I don't think I've been disappointed by any of the grilled items, but the standouts have been the bacon wrapped scallops, the pork shoulder, and the beef.

Of course, this never stops me from getting a couple of skewers on top of it all, but hey, I like my food. <br><br>I've also tried a few of the maki rolls, and the fish seems to be pretty fresh and tasty. But the real stars of the show here are the skewers and bento boxes...and those are worth the trip back multiple times.<br><br>Quick word about service - excellent. Nary a problem.

A zesty roll--with just the right amount of kick.<br><br>4. South Beach: Super white tuna, spicy tuna, mango, Japanese pepper, sesame oil, masago, spicy mayo, lime, red and black tobiko.

On the lighter side, we did the South Beach, the whitest super white tuna I've seen, nice balance between mango, jap pepper and lime, last but not least the Pot River, finally a jumbo roll that you can actually fit in your mouth (don't attempt the Po Boy roll at Coast, I don't know who could take that thing down)..also delicious and a crowd pleaser. All sauces, ie. wasabi mayo, sweet soy, eel sauce are displayed next to the roll, its freaky the patterns that they produce.. literally an art form and nice because you can have as much or as little as you want. <br><br>We had more wine to drink so we ordered mochi ice cream in every flavor, each was great and sweet and chewy on the outside, great way to end the evening. <br><br>Definitely going back, and will be ordering take out too.

The place is pretty cozy but service is friendly. It's BYOB if you're so inclined, and I don't remember ever paying a corkage fee. Most of the food is made to share - make sure to get the cucumber salad. Finally, if you order over $50 (no small task), you can save $10 by checking in on Yelp.

Ordering from the Robata Grill before ordering your sushi is a must.  The beef short rib was amazing!  I ordered 2 servings of this due to how delicious the flavor was.  The prices on the robata grill are great and make it easy for groups to order a bunch of things and try a variety of meats/vegetables.  I also tried the shrimp, bacon wrapped scallop, chicken satay, pork shoulder, and asparagus.  The pork shoulder was another standout.<br><br>2) BYOB - No corkage fees!  Once our waitress saw that we had a bottle of wine, she immediately came over with a bucket of ice and opened our wine.  Excellent service!<br><br>3) Takes Reservations - This place can get pretty packed, so it is nice that you can make reservations ahead of time.  Both times my group was seated immediately, while others who did not have reservations were waiting for tables. The other sushi spot I also like a lot does not take reservations, so this is a huge plus for me.  <br><br>Most importantly, the sushi here is top notch.  There is a huge variety and literally everything we ordered was amazing.  I would definitely recommend the Chicago Spring Roll and the Sorry I'm Drunk Roll.  I can't wait to go back again!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "By far our favorite sushi place we've been to in Chicago!<br><br>The fact that you can make reservations is great.

We have tried all the large rolls that come with the crazy sauce art on the plate and even though the look of it is impressive (as are the rolls by themselves), the last time we went we decided to try the simpler rolls. By far, the simple rolls (such as Spicy Scallop and Alaska) were our preference. Sushi rice is seasoned perfectly and the rolls were amazing.

Secondly, our server Pam was the best! She was very understanding and patient when we arrived and immediately got stuck in conversation. In the meantime she poured our water and opened our wine(B.Y.O.B.). We got appetizers and Pam was very helpful with suggestions. The same occurred when we ordered our sushi, Pam was upbeat, informative, courteous and very funny. While the rolls were delicious and prepared with care and artistic flare, the Sashimi is what stuck out to me. It was the so fresh and mild with beautiful texture.

When we got there, the host (same one from before) said that we had no reservation because someone had called and canceled earlier in the day. We told him that, no, we had called to change the reservation and confirm it, and that we also had a confirmation text from the restaurant. He kept trying to convince us that we had canceled it.

Was very good. The flavors almost melted into each other. I would get this one again.

On this particular night... Salmon = good, Inari = Good. Yellow Tail = not so fresh, Uni = excellent. <br>- Mochi: They had mango, strawberry and green tea. Cut into quarters and decorated nicely. These were yummy and easy to share.<br><br>ATMOSPHERE: it's hip and urban with enough recycled materials in the restaurant to make any semi-tree-hugging-sushi-loving person feel good about themselves.

The ribeye and bacon scallop robata were very flavorful. We had the boston crunchy roll which was the low point but that's relative because it was still very good.

I'm often let down when I build a place up, but not this time. I'm not gonna lie, I came to Yuzu 3 times in 1 week. I was a little embarrassed when the waitresses were asking me 'back again?' <br><br>Doesn't matter if you come here with a group or on a date, the experience & food is great. Make sure you call ahead for a reservation. All 3 times I called pretty last minute and was able to get tables for prime dinner times on Weds & Thurs nights. On Friday, our group of 4 got a table for 9pm.<br><br>The workers are incredibly nice. They're like little Asian elves that just want to make sure you are enjoying yourselves. No, but for real. My first visit, my group had to wait for a 4 top to finish. They took their sweet time and chatted and finished their wine, which is pretty expected and not a huge deal. The hostess kept apologizing and pouring our wine for us. She brought us complimentary edamame to eat while we waited. I'm not sure who was more uncomfortable with the wait, us or the hostess. After 30 minutes, she informed the table that we were waiting for their table. I imagine this annoyed them because this is typically really rude, but in such a small restaurant with limited seating I can kind of understand. They were pretty cool about it, too. At the end of our meal, the hostess apologized again for the wait and gave us a $5 gift certificate for our next visit.<br><br>My 2nd and 3rd times visiting that week were just as great. The food was sushi at it's best. Tasty and fresh, and not covered with sauces that muddle every roll to be indistinguishable... aka 'white people sushi'<br><br>For the sake of length, here are a few reccos for any future visitors:<br>Starters<br>Avocado Mango Salad - A light way to start your meal. Dressing is a little spicy but offset with avocados and mango slices. All3 times this was great and I could eat this every day.<br>Tuna Poke - Artfully presented and equally delicious. Not fishy at all and really good. Also good for avocado lovers.<br><br>Robata Grill - Must try <br>Pork Shoulder - Unreal. The glaze on this is like crack. <br>Beef Short Rib - One of my favorites, but consensus is it was too fatty. I love fatties... er I mean meats, of course, so I loved this. If you're not into fatty meats, go with the pork shoulder. Probably unnecessary to get both cuz they're very similar.<br>Bacon Scallop - Can't go wrong with Bacon<br>Tuna Miso - My least favorite thing I've gotten here. Thought the fish was kinda dry and chewy. It was thick cut and glazed. <br><br>Maki<br>My Favorite Midwest Roll - $8.50<br>Riceless roll? Weird so I had to try. I ordered it all 3 times. I am not a fan of cream cheese in my maki rolls, but this is really creative and well done. Lightly battered and not too heavy. Try this.<br>Black Sea Roll - $8.50  <br>Really simple but really good. Sunflower seeds are a nice touch.<br>Pier 69 - $14.50<br>Everyone raves about this roll. It's good but all I could taste was the fried soft shell crab. It's beautifully presented though. Didn't really taste the coconut.<br>Fire Roll - $15.00<br>For the jumbo rolls, this one was my favorite. And I don't even like spicy food! Took a chance and the spice is really subtle. Minimal sweat, thank god. Highly recommend this roll over their other jumbo rolls!<br>Pot River - $15.00<br>Another good one. Fresh but the cilantro turned me off.<br>Sorry I am Drunk Roll - $11.00<br>So good for unagi lovers. Small and simple roll but really tasty. It's like a better version of a unagi roll that I would get at other sushi restaurants.<br><br>Damnit, I did it again. I have had comments that my reviews are too long but I wanted to do this place justice. Also worth noting... they play rap and the sushi chefs look young and trendy. I can appreciate a sushi chef wearing a fedora and jamming to Kanye while he's crafting my maki. Also, they gave us free dessert that was bomb.

My favorite is the pork. The sashimi tuna with truffle is a must try.

We also got the spicy miso soup, which was good miso soup, but still trying to find that spicy part. We got the 100 year old something roll that was tasteless, loose and fluffy with bad cuts of fish in it. We also got 2 spicy salmon avocado rolls, which are not listed on the menu and they seemed very confused as to how to accomplish the spicy part, which actually kind of alarmed me hearing this while my husband was ordering on the phone. I said add spicy mayo, that came on the side, was not spicy at all. I also got 6 pieces of sake(salmon) sashimi and it was not the greatest. I ate one piece and quit. We only ate 75% of our food.

Completely inedible and it cost $7. <br><br>Midwest roll: the only thing I got that was actually decent and why this place didnt get 1 star<br><br>Boston crunchy: basically a spicy tuna roll with avocado.

Btw I am a fan of sushi places that have fun, creative names for their rolls instead of the run of the mill \"Dragon Roll\".  I feel like it adds to the experience and helps make it one of kind which is something I always look for when visiting a restaurant for the first time.  Both of these rolls had great presentation and we're delicious.  The Motown roll was fried so always a crowd pleaser.  In addition to the rolls, we also shared the sushi gold platter. Now my friend had been raving about the sashimi for weeks and the pieces were so fresh it tasted like butter.  I was a little skeptical since I'm a bit harsher in my opinions compared to her. However I have to say,  the sashimi was just as tender, fresh and buttery as she promised.  So I ate my words...literally.  Overall the experience was positive. <br>The food tasted good,  reasonably priced, descent portions and great presentation to go along. The menu had enough variety to keep the locals coming back for more and yet still had enough traditional items on the menu for the sushi purists.  Parking is on the street but definitely has enough spots available( these are the cheap meters, at least by city standards).  It was a refreshing change of pace from the typical Loop or River North trendy sushi spots.

They could also tell I was new to the place, and even went as far as to tell me NOT to order more food, because the rolls I already ordered were going to be big and I wouldn't be able to finish them. They tried to help me along, and even cautioned me against the Very Spicy Tuna roll, but I said \"Bring It!\" and they brought their A-game. The rolls themselves have some funny names, like \"Sorry I'm Drunk\" roll, which is worth noting. They even gave me an extra specialty piece of sushi, just because it was my first time there, and they wanted me to come back. While I appreciated the gesture, they certainly didn't need to do it, because the sushi was terrific and I was completely sold on the place on what I ordered. <br><br>Overall, a hidden gem in a far-flung corner of Chi-town, and it was nice to get away from the ritzy side of the city for a change.

I thought it would just be another craptastic cloned restaurant featuring such wonderful creations as tasteless grilled 0.2oz chicken breast on a stick and 1 fried shrimp wrapped in seaweed along with spicy mayo, fried crumbs, cream cheese, rice, call it a (cityname) roll and charge $$ per roll. Insert Ikea furniture, decor from Chinatown gift shops, non-Japanese speaking staff/owners, yuppy neighborhood and voilà, another small business loan waiting to default in less than three years.  <br><br>Well...I guess this place isn't 100% different than other non-Japanese owned Japanese restaurants but here's the good part:<br> The skewers here are for people with taste buds and appetites bigger than a 2 yr old. And at $1.5 - $2.5 a skewer, you can actually get full without spending $$$. You should probably get in before they figure out that they can get away with charging you $2 for 0.2oz of chicken with no seasoning.  <br>They try to innovate with other Asian inspired dishes like the curry puff...which is a Samosa but sweet. Not sure if I like it but at least they didn't photocopy their menu like every other Japanese restaurant.<br>I think the decent portions of their tasty skewers, plus BYOB and the convenient parking is a winning combo in itself. Although they still offer the (city name) $$ rolls, but I guess without it the majority of the populace won't understand what sort of Asian food it is they are ingesting.  <br><br>The service was mixed, said they weren't expecting so many ppl on a monday night.

The roll was great, the sauce they put on the side was a little spicy but good nonetheless. We also had the pork shoulder which is marinated and so tender. We had the tuna poke, my only complaint was that there was too much avocado and not enough tuna. They give u cucumber water with a slice of lemon which is really nice.

All in all, highly recommended.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I never would have noticed this place if I hadn't been looking for it.  From the looks of the exterior I was a little nervous at first, but the staff was incredibly friendly from the moment we entered.  We were quickly greeted with jars of water laced with lemon and cucumber-- refilled enough to make me use their bathroom before the meal had ended (the bathroom passed the clean test by the way).  We started with tuna and shitake mushrooms from the robata grill: both were good, but the mushrooms were the gustatory winner.  We ordered several rolls: spicy tuna, my favorite midwest roll (no rice), dragon, south beach and Pier 99.  All were good enough to merit a second visit, but the dragon and Pier 99 were my two favorites.  Next time I plan to sample a few sashimi pieces so I can experience the true quality of the fish, but based on tonight's experience alone Yuzu has earned itself a reservation in my future of sushi consumption.  If you live in the area, it's definitely worthy of a visit.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The chicken satay was fabulous! The sushi was so-so.  Small rolls that fell apart-and most of the taste was from the spicy mayo.  And the seats were beyond uncomfortable!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Great With reservations, I probably would not recommend this place for sushi BUT! I will recommended for their robata grill great chicken,steak,tuna and peppers loved it all!.\"... My kid and boyfriend loved it... My boyfriend order  \"under the rainbow\" it never came... Granted our friendly waitress was pull on many directions she did manage to charge us for it,which we notice she was so nice about it didn't even question it, she give us the right bill and we were in our way... Again if you know your sushi you'll never come here... But for great service and great grill PLUS it is BYOB", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Guess I'd better try it again. Went in at 6pm for take out, and the \"soundtrack\" was x-rated gangsta. Loud. And the lights were on dim. Couldn't see the menu. The music was so offensive that I ordered quickly to get out. Fish was fresh enough. Salad of sashimi and avocado was good. Certainly not a relaxing time. I agree about the decor, but at least it's not boring. But lose the mother******* music.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I LOVE the decor, food was great!  I am not a sushi fan, but the grill was GREAT!   BYOB, which is nice.

While the service is great the food needs work.  Our Miso was cold, bad start. The appetizers, short ribs, tuna and pork were also cold and over cooked.  The sushi was good, not the best but not the worse. It was certainly the highlight of the meal.  I would recommend for a casual weekday sushi dinner...skip the starters.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "ordered sashimi gold - 15 pieces of sashimi.  unfortunately 3/15 were unagi (cooked, saucy eel).  i really don't call that sashimi.<br>the pieces were relatively small.<br>this alone would have pushed me to give 1 or 2 stars, but the second order i placed of 2 different roe and more hamachi was half decent.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I LOVE THIS PLACE!  Everything I have tried here is amazing and everyone I have brought with me loves it as well.  I have never walked out disappointed and have been here countless times.  Plus, it's BYO, they play the best music and everyone is very friendly.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "robata grill at its best , with byob!! nothing beats this place:", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Visited Yuzu on a Friday night with a large group.  The food was good and the staff was friendly.  We were able to get parking right out front which was good.  For the price, Yuzu is great value.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "This place is great! The sushi is really good. The robata grill items are good too. I love the scallops (both kinds). I've actually eaten here a few times, and don't remember all that I have had, but everything has been great. It's got a cool theme, and is lively. Love the BYOB too!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "i went there for their robata grill and it was fantastic. the pork shoulder and beef short ribs stole the show. i ordered 3, maybe 4 of each, it's hard to remember with the byob; i just kept ordering. i left full with a smile on my face and my date was happy too since sushi was her reason for being there (which she thought was quite delicious).", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "ok, the food rocks, the art on the walls is really cool but most of all the thai sweetness of the owners comes thru in every aspect of how they treat everyone. this place is a treat for the belly, the soul and the spirit!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "My boyfriend brought me to Yuzu on Friday night.  He had already read a few great reviews and wanted to try the skewers.  We loved it.  We went on the early side (6:30ish) and got a seat right away.  We orded the gyoza and the mango salad to start.  The gyoza was fantastic.  The salad looked great, but was difficult to pull the mango pieces off the skin with chopsticks.  Next we ordered 3 skewers, beef short ribs (of which we ordered two more at the end of our meal), pork shoulder, and chicken and onion.  Short ribs were the best of all three.  We also ordered three sushi rolls...the midwest, boston crunchy, and hamachi jalapeno simple roll.  All were excellent, not the best sushi I had had, but great for the price.  As we ate there were a lot of people coming in, by the time we left people were waiting for tables.  Servicers were friendly albeit a bit hard to understand.  The dishes either all came out at once, or we had to wait.  The food was so good we didn't really care.  We will definitely go back.  One of Chicago's  hidden gems.", "pics": null}}]}}
