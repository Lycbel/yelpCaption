I think if I went to Kuma's without thinking I was going to get the best burger that's ever crossed my lips without anything coming close to being as good, I would have been more impressed. <br>However, it is a pretty damn good burger. I love the atmosphere as well. I've noticed there's a theme throughout the city with heavy metal + bomb burger places. Which even though I'm not personally into heavy metal, I dig the combination. <br>I'm a huge appetizer girl, but considering I heard these burgers were massive I skipped on ordering anything else. I'm glad I did because the photos are not deceiving... these burgers are huuuge. And they don't skimp on the fries either. Speaking of the fries... they were alright. I wouldn't knock the burger based on the fries but they weren't anything special. I ordered the Kaijo burger which is topped with bacon, blue cheese and friend onion straws. My fiancé ordered the Pantera burger. Mixed feelings on my choice. Like I said, it was very good, don't get me wrong. I would have eaten an entire bowl of those fried onions. But it was a little one note for me. The pretzel bun to patty ratio was off, too much bread to meat. So the whole thing just tasted slightly dry. My fiancé enjoyed his, but also agreed it wasn't the best burger he's EVER had. I liked his better than mine, maybe I'd stick with a traditional bun next time. <br>The service was great and I feel like places like these have the best employees, they're always so laid back and down to earth. Their menu has sooo many great burger combinations that I would definitely come back to try more. Not my number 1 burger place, but it's up there and everyone should try it!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jg9HQED4Y55wr8vCgPiweQ/348s.jpg", "caption": "Top: Pantera Bottom: Kaijo"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Heavy metal and burgers. Burgers meet mosh pit. Head bangers and burgers. Their burgers are big and bold, and take inspiration from heavy metal music as you'll notice the theme throughout the restaurant.  When I first moved to Chicago just over 3 years ago, the guys delivering my mattress were raving about the burgers Kuma's Corner and that it was a must try when in Chicago. Over 3 years later, I can say that the burgers indeed did not disappoint! Along side of the heavy metal playing throughout the shop, the walls are lined with decor of some of the heavy hitters and even their burgers named after famous bands.<br><br>Being naturally drawn to burgers with a bit of a kick to them and being an Iron Maiden fan, you could say I didn't have to look too much further to find the burger calling my name. The Iron Maiden is stacked with avocados, cherry peppers, pepperjack cheese, slabbed with a healthy serving of chipotle mayo, and of course the fresh lettuce, tomato, and red onions to complete the burger experience. All of this stacked on a 10oz patty cooked to your liking. The medium came out perfect and I kind of loved you could see the fire roaring from kitchen with the heavy metal blasting. Really don't have anything bad to say about the burger... it was big, juicy, and messy from the get go. The combination of ingredients had my taste buds two stepping the entire time. The fries were pretty good, no complaints there.<br><br>While the burgers are pretty awesome, ambiance is a bit dark and gloomy. Probably wouldn't be a first choice for a date or after a gnarly hangover just due to consistent metal being played.

I would definitely recommend this burger. It might be my go to burger here, but I might venture off and order something else.

This includes a pretzel bun, bacon, cheese, lettuce, onion, tomato, egg and 10 oz burger. We ordered this medium rare and it came exactly as I imagined it. This is a solid burger with a great beefy flavor. It's rare that medium rare is done right on a burger but they did it. The toppings were all fresh but the bun was a bit doughy.

The patty itself was delicious, but what made the meal for me was the preparation. The burger was served on a pretzel roll (a personal favorite of mine), with vegan cheese AND vegan mayonnaise (pretty deluxe for a place that previously prided itself on offering no vegan options). The tomato jam, mashed avocado, red onion, and arugula all added nicely to the flavor and I left feeling very satisfied. <br><br>Of course, since Kuma's will always have some attitude, we overheard the folks next to us talking shit on vegan burgers and veganism. Personally, I was delighted to listen to their shit-talk while anticipating a cruelty-free burger.

Additionally a bunch of the guests seem to be parts of biker gangs as they were clad in their distinctive vest jackets. It was an interesting setting to say the least.<br><br>It took a while for us to get our order taken, but that was fine because each of us in our group had difficulty deciding on which of the extremely eclectic burgers we wanted to get. Many of their burgers were also named after hard rock bands, and had some heavy metal feeling to them, which I found amusing as well. Whenever I'm faced with difficulty deciding, I usually just get the main flagship dish at a restaurant, and so that's what I did here.<br><br>The Famous Kuma - Honestly, not a great burger. For a place that specializes in burgers, and with so many interesting options and combinations to choose from, I was pretty stunned at how flavorless the actual burger meat was to me. It was extremely greasy and messy, which aren't necessarily negative attributes for me - but when something is so greasy and full of fat, you really expect it to be bursting with flavor, which was definitely not the case. It's like sinking your teeth into something drenched in plain oil... The bacon was also too salty and without much hearty bacon flavor. The burger was just falling apart by the end of the meal, since there was so much oil soaking through all of it.<br><br>The fries were pretty good.<br><br>In retrospect, I should have ordered a burger other than the Famous Kuma, because I think a huge part of the allure of Kuma's is trying out some of their more intriguing flavor combinations. I sampled my friend's Goatsnake, which actually was brimming with flavor from the goat cheese and vinagrette, and was quite good. So I guess the flavor in most of their burgers actually comes from the toppings as opposed to the burger meat itself.<br><br>Overall, I was pretty disappointed with my Famous Kuma burger.

I was feeling a salad, so i ordered a wedge salad. The wedge salad is wedge lettuce with bacon crumbles, crispy potatoes and fried onions! It was more of a fried onion/potato plate with some wedge lettuce :) Obviously, everything was delicious, just not as light as i was hoping.<br><br>The Kuma's burger with fried egg on top seems to be a staple and it was very good! Be warned: the burgers are 10oz, so definitely on the bigger/heavier side. Our friend ordered the BBQ Pork fries, which probably was the best thing we ordered that night. The fries are perfectly topped with cheese and pulled pork. lastly, the husband ordered the Slayer burger, which isn't a burger at all, but a patty on top of a bed of fries, topped with lots of goodness.

We also chose an order of the jalapeno poppers. We sat and watched Frankenstein's monster as we waited, cause apparently this place is just that cool that they play movies for their guests.  They were all horror films except this one, but it was perfect. <br>The poppers came out crispy and perfectly golden brown and were served with raspberry dipping sauce.  They had chorizo mixed into the cream cheese and they were the most perfect, delicious poppers I have ever tasted.  I dream about them still.  The burgers arrived and we both just sat in awe for a few seconds before we could speak.  After a couple pictures for instagram we dove in to our meals and didn't come up for air until they were both half gone.

I would have tried the burgers but I wanted to try their Mac and cheese which was a meal itself. Their Mac in cheese was very delicious!!! It is no Kraft product in a box!!!  They added extra ingredients that is fresh and healthy like green peas, Chicken breast, Mushrooms, Andalusian sausage and many more . It was about $14 regular with 2 ingredients to add but anything over is $2 per extra. My waitress Sparkles recommend it and was very happy! I will be coming back for their metal burgers. Reason only 4 Out of 5 is because their alcoholic mix drink selection is limited and wanted the monster with gingerale syrup but didn't have it. Also no dessert menu.

There is table seating but as this was a Saturday night I rather not wait the 30  minutes and I also enjoyed my friendly bartender's conversation about astrology she joined in on while me and my date were chatting and waiting on food. I will also note that I felt very comfortable in my skin there for it to be a pub with such a rockerish theme. There were people dressed casually but also there was smart casual and beyond. And granted from what I could see my date and I were the only black couple present that evening, I get the kind of feeling that everyone is accepted here, which makes me even better in telling my friends, family, and Yelp lovers about this one.<br><br>Now let's get to what they are known for.. crazy good burgers! They didn't disappoint. Although after reviewing a neighbor's dish, I would've gladly subbed for a mac n cheese dish that this place is also known for, as it looked yummy! However, I ordered the Sourvein for the thrill of it. It has blackened chicken tenders (which had to be amongst my favorite part of the sandwich, succulent, well-seasoned and grilled), applewood smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, waffle strips, and maple syrup all on a 10 oz beef patty with a pretzel bun. This thing looks like a concoction your mother would look at you in disgust for in HER kitchen, but here it is A-OK. And the way it all comes together in taste is surprisingly good. The presentation is definitely food porn worthy as you can see in my pictures and if you can eat it it all in one sitting you should be a Man vs. Beast competitor. This burger is breakfast and lunch and it everything meshes well together in a medly of food fantasticness with crunchy, crispy fries on the side and a good ale my tastebuds were VERY pleased.

It holds such a devoted identity to metal music that even the burgers are named after metal bands. The staff is super friendly and approachable, and if you decide to grab a beer the bartenders will know exactly what to recommend to compliment your approaching meal.<br><br>Which leads me to my next point: the food. I can't speak much on the burgers since I don't eat red meat, but I do know they have patty alternatives including a bean patty. But my fiancé goes nuts over their burgers, which is how I first found myself at this restaurant to begin with. My personal favorite is the Mac and Cheese, which is to die for. Like I would stab someone for even half a bowl of it. Each bowl is cooked with a top layer of bread crumbs and scallions, but you also get to choose two extra ingredients for free (any more costs extra). The serving size is ginormous; not only do the left overs last me the week but reheated it tastes nearly identical to being cooked fresh. You definitely get your money's worth. Though if I'm being completely honest I could probably eat a meal off the fried pickles and just take more mac and cheese home. The fried pickles are incredibly crispy and the chipotle sauce is the perfect compliment to it. <br><br>My only complaint is the waiting process for a table. The restaurant itself is small, and because they are such a popular restaurant they don't take reservations, so if you wait until the dinner rush you could be waiting over an hour for a table, which obviously no one wants to do. This was slightly annoying on my first visit since I'm the kind of person that wants to eat immediately once my stomach has decided it needs filling. While the food is definitely worth the wait I would definitely recommend trying to stop by at a less busy time, especially if you're coming in for the first time.

We went with the chicken and bacon. Note, if you don't like scallions/green onions, make sure you tell them, or else they will sprinkle them on top. The mac-n-cheese was nice and creamy and the macaroni was cooked perfectly. I'm telling ya -- a skeptic like me, who thinks \"what's the big deal about Mac N Cheese? Why would people pay for it at a restaurant?\" the mac n cheese is definitely something you should try.<br><br>BATHROOM REVIEW: Located near the back (near the open -air kitchen) the bathrooms are one-stallers.

But anyway, a racing bike was secured to an upside down \"U\" a short distance from the front entrance, the black metal covered in street art stickers. And apparently Square Bar, across the street, opened JUST to take in overflow from Kuma's, so I've been told.<br><br>Me: I was like \"FINALLY I get to try Kuma's... give me a burger and a beer and I am a happy girl!\"<br><br>Reading the look from my out-of-town visitor: semi-shock. \"What is this place?!\" This was not her usual scene... but she was a great sport and I PROMISED that Kuma's has \"one of Chicago's best burgers\" so she went along with it.  A fellow Yelper called this a \"pilgrimage\" which I found kind of accurate. Kuma's is a place everyone should go at least once in your life, to taste the burgers for yourself.<br><br>The hostess kept an eye out for us and once two spots opened up at the left-side of the bar (we were 30 minutes into our wait), she dutifully signaled us to take those prized seats. Those seats, closest to the wall, gave us a little more breathing room, but we were still jostled around in our stools from people ordering drinks behind us.  Though, I live literally, right next to the CTA and ride the train all the time, I guess the jostling was not as bothersome to me. <br><br>The BURGERS did not disappoint.  <br><br>Here's what we ordered:<br>[burger] \"Iron Maiden\" - pepperjack cheese, chipotle mayo, lettuce, onion, tomatoes, avacado <br>[burger] \"Absu\"- tomatillo salsa, pepperjack cheese, red onion avacado relish, quesco fresco, trio of breaded, deep fried chilis (on the side)<br>[drink] Allagash White on tap<br>[drink] Root Beer on tap (pretty amazing with a burger)<br><br>The burgers alone were SPOT on. (I have not tried Au Cheval yet so cannot compare...). Kuma's menu and its atmosphere is one-of-a-kind.  After we were stuffed, kinda cramped and stepped out of Kuma's into the fresh air, and we both confirmed that Kuma's serves up some amazing burgers.  You might get jostled around a bit, and be on the brink of losing your voice talking over some heavy metal, but man, that was a great burger.

The wait can be long so go on a weekday or before 8 pm. The music can be really loud at times they should lower it. service good<br><br>12$ Jalepeno poppers: amaiazing! Best one i ever had! Its not just like ur typical poppers. The outside is supper crunchy due to the panko bread crumbs n their not greasy or burnt. The jalepeno is fresh and big not supper small. The cream cheese filling is amaizin theres chorizo inside but wish there was more chorizo because theirs not alot. The dipping sauce is what makes it great, its a sweat sauce so it makes the dish sweat and salty. Would order again its not supper spicy as u would think cause theirs no seeds n the veins of jalepeno have been taken out. My only complain was it needed some salt it is busy so maybe they forgot to season<br><br>Mac n cheese $14: this is one of my favorite mac n cheeses. Its a huge portion its not ur typical lil container so be warned to not order more tjen 1. I got it this time with bacon and chicken. The chicken was flavorful not dry not alot of pieces and there wasnt alot of bacon in it either so plz add more! It was really cheesy no american cheese thank u cheese but it wasnt as creamy as i remember it was maybe they make it a new way? Still good the love the bread crumbs on top wish there was bread crumps on all of the mac n cheese not just the middle though. some of the pasta didnt have cheese on it so they might not have made a béchamel wish u must so its really creamy. I understand presentation is important but putting raw onions on sometjint is a no no the raw onion flavor over powers everything n ruins the pallet  still a really good mac n cheese one of the best ive had just fix the issues n itll be even better<br><br>Slayer $16: (we warned its huge couldnt finish it all) first lets talk about the actual burger its so flavorful!! Like u could jus eat the patty by itself its seasoned beutifully not bland at all. Then the size of it is huge ur really get ur moneys worth. Its cooked to perfection supper moist. The chili is the star of the dish its so flavorful one of the best chilis i ever had. It adds so much richness and depth to the dish. My one complaint is theres not enough chili, the chili is what makes this dish so Add more plz. Then theres fries omg omg their fries are so good perfectly fried u can tell they fried it more then once their supper crunchy without being burned or greasy i love these fries omg so good. One issue is i wish the fries were on top so they would stay crunchy n wouldnt get soggy Another issue they season them with sea salt so they could be a lil salty though but that can easily be fixed by changing the salt they use, n if u get an order with fried it comes with ketchup i think thats childish fries should always get served with an aioli still one of the best fries i ever had. Omg there is so much cheese I love it! Nothing goes better with a burger then cheese! Theres pickled peppers which add a nice acidic heat that cuts through the richness of the dish! Love the heat! Theres andouille sausage which i love but i like my sausage charred on the grill its a personal prefference just it makes sausage taste so much bettter but i loved the sausage its so much better then bacon. I wish they would add an egg to make it more rich and more decadent since thats what their going for, even adding some bbq pork would cut down some of the richness and the saltiness of the dish.i would order this in a heart beat one of the best burgers i ever had<br><br>Yob 15$: based on the description it sounded to plain but it really is delicous perfect combination of sweet and salty. The bell pepper is really sweet and cooked nicely i dont like my vegetables to crunchy, the sweetness pairs beautifully with the saltiness of the burger. I dont like gouda cheese but in the burger it goes perfect with everything the smokey cheesy flavor makes the burger decadent, so mych so, that u will not stop eating it. Then theres bacon omg yes nothing makes a burger taste better then bacon. The sauce on the burger makes it so rich but its not to overwhelming with the garlic which is a good thing I have no complaints of this burger but next time i come i wanna try the more adventurous burgers <br><br>Fries:I jus wish instead of ketchup they would serve aioli cause ketchup is to basic. An issue with the fries is since they use sea salt they could be salty but this can be fixed with regular salt, or u can just remove the salt yourself.<br><br>Bbq fries 13$: the fries are Their perfectly crisp. The fries have been fried multiple times without being greasy or burnt, it is very hard to make fries correctly and kumas corners does an amaizing job! I jus wish instead of ketchup they would serve aioli. The bbq pork is really tender and flavorful not dry or old which bbq pork can be. The bbq sauce is sweet but not overwhelmingly sweet. The saltiness of the fries and the sweetness goes perfectly togethe", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1CugDzug1zuuLyng1gjNPA/348s.jpg", "caption": "$14 Mac n cheese huge portion one of my favorite mac n cheeses"}, {"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2IAYR3p-IRkJmPzSWkY0fg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Slayer 16$ look at this massive portion i couldnot finish it so fucking good!"}, {"url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YF2Ibt3v-oNvMWZUHDw5Iw/168s.jpg", "caption": "12$ Jalepeno poppers best i ever had"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Kuma's Corner was recommended to me by a friend I had met in Richmond where we bonded over our love of GwarBar.  He texted me after finding out I was in Chicago and said, \"It's everything GwarBar should be!\" which had me extremely intrigued.  After reading the reviews I was sold, so we made the trek to find Kuma's Corner which is nestled on this not so busy street but you can spot Kuma's Corner easily as it's the only place you'll see people waiting outside.<br><br>We waited for about 30 minutes for a table in this nice snug restaurant.  The music is a little bit loud as I was even having a hard time hearing our server.  Our server recommended the monthly specials to us which were changing in just two days.  Taking her recommendation, I ordered the devil's hot mess - chicken tenders coated in Frank's hot sauce, mac and cheese, with pickled jalapenos and I was so happy I took her recommendation!  This is every spicy eater's dream.  The bowl was huge - probably twice the size of my entire face by the time I threw in the towel it didn't even look like I had put a dent into the dish.<br><br>The atmosphere is pretty divey, they've got metal music playing in the background, along with a gory movie on the tv screen, and the burgers are all heavy metal named themed but don't let that fool you, it definitely doesn't lack on taste!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "It was ok.

It had Roasted Garlic Mayo, Crushed Garlic, House-made Hot Sauce, Jalapenos, Tortilla Strips, Lettuce, Tomato and Onions. I'm a big spice head so the house-made hot sauce and jalapenos really spoke to me.

This place serves a heart attack on a plate. However, if you're comfortable on your way to heaven via nirvana, then Kuma's is it. <br><br>This local tavern come burger joint has existed for a long time. One interesting tidbit about Kuma's is that it was hip before it was hip to be hip. The staff has always marched to its own beat, with plenty of tattoos, beards, piercings, and attitude. Now that these affectations are the coin of the realm, that the bar and wait staff have a sort of 'been there, done that' attitude is merely an earned stripe.<br><br>At one time, the idea that all of the burgers are named after heavy metal bands and the ambiance is serenaded with the same probably attracted a certain type of music aficionado. Now, it's just part of the charm. I can't tell the difference between the music of Goatsnake from High on Fire, but I can tell you the latter makes one helluva delicious burger. There is a precision to the execution of the burgers here, from the chewy pretzel rolls to the hand ground high quality beef. You're not limited to beef, either. You can opt for a vegetarian patty or a leaner bison patty for for an upcharge. What they put on them, however, puts these things into the the artisanal territory: poblano corn relish, grilled pineapple, brie, poached pears, fried egg, and the list goes on. There's usually a BOTM or Burger of the Month, which just might knock your socks off with creativity. This month's Deafheaven offered me a burger with a full serving of pork brisket, honey glazed brussels sprouts, and frizzled butternut squash. That was stupid good. You can opt for house made potato chips or fries on the side with your burger. Both are done crispy and just a bit brown. The chips are my favorite.<br><br>Because you might not get enough fat from the burgers, they offer a sinful macaroni and cheese made to order with add ins from carmelized onions, to scallions, to mushrooms or roasted red peppers. The portions are ungodly.<br><br>If that weren't enough, Kuma's has been a beacon to beer and whiskey drinkers well before the craze went viral. I love that the servers are well versed in which rotating beer selection might best accompany your menu choice.<br><br>In the warmer months, you can enjoy your burgers on the patio out back. Otherwise, there are perhaps 12 tables and bar seats for the rest of the patrons. Unless you go at an off-time, be prepared to wait, because Kuma's doesn't take reservations.<br><br>It's hella-good!", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eV9QetEmf5XibFDhs6clqA/348s.jpg", "caption": "Graffiti over classic American tattoo wallpaper in the men's room"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JqOGT_Hxcc0hv5jdQlK9sw/168s.jpg", "caption": "House chili"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5V880zAOhiBSl1QynVeP_Q/168s.jpg", "caption": "Mac and Cheese special: breakfast items sausage, fried egg, honey"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "While being on vacation in Chicago we would ask our uber drivers where did they eat in Chicago as usually local spots are way better than the usual tourist related restaurants.

Since I'm usually indecisive, I asked the waitress what's the most popular spicy burger and she suggested the ABSU. My friend got the Iron Maiden. The burgers come with a side of fries which were crispy (the way that I like it). <br><br>While we wait for our food, we chatted over heavy metal rock music blasting from overhead stereos, so loud that we had to shout at each other in order to have a conversation. We started looking around at the decor of the place and it kind of startled us to see artworks of skeletons and demon-like faces.<br><br>The burgers kind of took longer than expected to come out but it was worth the wait.

My only complaint is that the buns could be softer and warmer. <br><br>After finishing up, I waited in line for a one-stall restroom. I was appalled to see how much writing and profanity was written on the walls. Plus, the toilet and the floors looks like they haven't been cleaned which made me uncomfortable to use it.

The pretzel bun was quite sturdy in holding everything together; Too bad it wasnt as soft and moist as I wanted. The cheese was probably the only thing that really stood out.

I was trying to save my 100th review for NYE, but my experience at the original Kuma's was too good to not write about it. We decided to visit on a Sunday early evening. For it being Sunday, it was pretty crowded. The original Kuma's location is tiny, but mighty. When you walk in, it does feel like you are in a queue backstage at a Def Leppard concert or something. Luckily, the bar is pretty big and we were able to snag a spot there while we waited for a table. <br>   <br>I appreciated the fact that there was more than one cider option at the bar. They also had a few mixed drinks on special. The bartender was very nice and attentive. We ordered some jalapeño poppers and talked and drank at the bar. I also appreciate the fact that the metal music was not overbearing (unlike the Kuma's in Schaumburg) and I was actually able to hold a conversation with my friends. Lost Boys was playing on the TV, which was a double plus! <br>   <br>We ordered a Mac and cheese to split between the four of us-with andouille sausage, caramelized onions, and garlic. It came topped with scallions anyway so don't waste your ingredient on that unless you want A LOT of scallions. I'm not a huge Mac and cheese eater, but this was DELICIOUS! Enough cheese to stop your heart in 5 minutes. So goooood! <br>  <br>We also ordered burgers. My husband got  the Slayer, I shared the Goatsnake with my friend who traded me half of his Metallica burger. My other friend got another delicious burger, but I forgot the name of it. All of the burgers were cooked great and, of course, were huge and delicious. I think the Slayer will feed someone for 5 days. My favorite burger out of the night was definitely the Goatsnake. Our server at the table was also very nice and was attentive all night.

We started off with a round of Bloody Mary's which were tasty, spicy and delicious. An order of their Mac n Cheese and fried pickles to share. <br><br>First dish to come out was their fried pickles. This dish and the bloody Mary's may be the only contributing factor to this 2 star review. If it weren't for these items, I may have had to give this place a single star. <br><br>The fried pickles were amazing. Crunchy, airy and perfectly fried. The pickles were fried perfectly so they held onto their consistency and structure. I believe they use Panko bread crumbs so they were extra crispy. Also the batter stuck perfectly to the pickle. Don't you just hate it when the inside pulls apart from the batter when you take a bite? I do. <br><br>Next to come out was the garlic jalapeño and chicken mac n cheese. From the photos and reviews we were expecting some pretty awesome mac n cheese. When I think about good mac n cheese, it's that crunchy crispy buttery bread crumb topping with ooey gooey cheese blend and perfectly al dente noodles. It has the topping but didn't seem to have much cheese in it, felt kind of watery in consistency. The biggest problem was that the cheese sauce they made was completely broken. It had a mealy texture which made it unpleasant to eat. Let's jus say there was plenty leftover. <br><br>Finally the most waited for and anticipated item. The Kuma burger. It looked so good on arrival but as we eating I was truly disappointed. The bun weren't toasted, too much bread to meat ratio, don't know why but there were bites that were just so salty as if they had not mixed the meat mixture enough that left pockets of salt in the patty. I could only stomach half my burger. <br><br>What's even more sad is that the fries were soggy under salted and just not proper. <br><br>Had high expectations for this place.

My friends and I stopped here before our Revolution Brewery Tour Saturday and oh my gosh am I glad I finally got the opportunity to visit. <br><br>One little secret about me: I love metal, heavy metal, new metal, old metal. Yes, I'm talking Metallica, Slipknot, Trivium, etc. No one had told me Kuma's Corner was the coolest heavy  metal themed restaurant in Chicago. Walking into Kuma's was the biggest most pleasant surprise, ever. The walls are red, there are \"hipster killer\" beers, guitars, band t-shirts, beer signage and all things heavy, odd and in-your-face. Fortunately, when my gang and I had arrived at Kuma's we got seated right away. The waitresses and employees all had the same look: tattoo sleeves, dark hair and crude t-shirts. I loved it. Our waitress in particular didn't have the most outgoing personality but served us well. She was very accommodating, filled our waters constantly, made trips to our table to be sure we were taken care of and had the most beautiful tattoo portrait on her forearm. Respect.<br><br>We had ordered fried pickles to start. These were easily the best I've had. They were of decent size, there was a sufficient amount of them and my boyfriend and I agreed they had the tastiest and crunchiest breading. I wasn't even planning on ordering an appetizer but God dang I'm glad I did. Two of us got burgers and two of us got mac & cheese. I can only speak for the mac & cheese but the men in my group both agreed it was an AWESOME burger - juicy, big and the fries that accompanied it were great too. The mac & cheese comes with breadcrumbs and scallions on top and allows you to add ingredients from a list for $2 extra (list includes ingredients such as sun-dried tomatoes, bacon, broccoli, etc.) I had ordered the chicken for my mac & cheese. This dish was VERY cheesy, tasty and the serving could literally last me 3 days. It was easily like 2 lbs of noodles. We were on our way to a brewery tour so we weren't interested in purchasing drinks but I would absolutely love to come back to try some of their beers.<br><br>Overall, Kuma's Corner had already sold me with the theme of the restaurant. I'm so happy Chicago has a place like this. No Katy Perry playlist or DJ blasting in your ear here. The food just confirmed my love for this place.

Heck these days even the food trucks in SF Bay area sell small a$$ burger and fries for 15 bucks so in that comparison Kuma is way better. <br><br>I have tried at least 50% of all burger types and on my recent visit I tried Iron Maiden. I have to say it was very good. <br>My test of a good burger is that it should be so tasty that I don't have to use ketchup with it and Kuma's is that place. Burgers are not just  patty of meat, they are flavorful and each burger has a distinct taste. <br><br>Kuma's corner and Hot Doug' (closed now) are two places which I hold at very high regard in Chicago area.

You won't find such juiciness elsewhere.<br><br>Visiting Chicago, I did my research on Yelp on some of the best eats. Of course I saw Kuma's with it's 4,000+ reviews. Thousands of reviews can only mean that it's popular among Chicago citizens. Furthermore, a good friend of mine raves about this place saying he could eat it every single day if he had enough to afford it. <br><br>This was the first meal I had in Chicago and I was shocked by the portion size. You better come ravenous cause there is going to be a lot of food. Since it was my first time, my friend agreed to split a burger and mac-n-cheese with me. You build your own mac-n-cheese here by choosing two toppings. You can choose additional toppings for an additional cost. We decided to go with the chicken and the sweet corn. For the burger, we shared a Mastadon which had BBQ sauce, bacon, sharp cheddar and frizzled onions. The burgers are recommended to be medium although they will do the wellness to your preference. I was very pleased that they will give you exactly what you ask for. Medium is medium and you can see the pink and juices on the inside. Cutting the burger in half felt like a sin but it needed to be done so I could have my half! The meat patty is so meaty and thick. The BBQ sauce is slathered everywhere and I love the texture of the frizzled onions. It adds that hint of onion slice you would get on a normal burger but in it's own fried way. The bun is a good vessel but I do find that it gets a little soggy. Each burger comes with fries. They are so dark that I almost that they were sweet potato fries. The fries are pretty average in my opinion, nothing too special.<br><br>The mac-n-cheese was delicious! The bowl and portion is giant. I have never seen so much mac-n-cheese in my life. Between my friend and I we only got through half the thing. It's perfectly cheesy in every way possible. I never thought of putting chicken in mac-n-cheese but I really liked the combination with the corn. Each piece of chicken was small enough to be present in each bite, without feeling like you were just eating slices of chicken. I love how the sweet corn added some texture and pop of sweetness to the rich and salty cheese. I would recommend sharing the mac-n-cheese with someone!<br><br>Service was great. Our waitress was witty and had some humor. Food came out promptly and we were checked up on at the right times. <br><br>There is just something really comforting about eating such fatty burgers and ridiculously giant mac-n-cheese.

It was a really good idea going with a few people (there was 4 of us), because it's that many more dishes that you can try to grab a bite off of. So we each got a different burger and then shared a big thing of mac and cheese. Note, that their mac comes in large portions, so it's perfect for sharing or for ordering for takeout alone on a rough night.<br><br>The burgers that made a lasting impression was Lair of the Minotaur (caramelized onion, pancetta, bourbon poached pears, and brie) and Mastadon (fried onions, bbq sauce, cheddar, and bacon). Birthday Boy got the Slayer, which was commendably manly, but it's pretty much a huge burger casserole that I wouldn't choose over a bunned masterpiece. Still good though. The one thing I will admit, is that I'm not crazy about pretzel buns. I realize it's the latest sandwich trend, but I'm not feeling them.

 I'm serious here - how do the creators of these magical burgers decide which food best represents the personality of these metal bands which the burgers are named after?  Is it an actual science or am I just way, way over-thinking this?  <br><br>Whether I'm over-thinking it or not is another question, but let me tell you - there is no question about how good the food is here.  I don't believe in Heaven, but if I did then Kuma's Corner would be the pearly gates while their burgers are Heaven on earth.  As heavenly as these burgers were I feel as if I committed a very sinful act by gluttonously shoving the burger's entirety in my mouth.  To be honest, though, I am 100% okay with being a sinner, especially when it comes to delicious food like that of Kuma's Corner.  <br><br>I apologize for that tangent - I just had to express how much I truly idolize Kuma's Corner and their absolutely wonderful creations!<br><br>Now, let me back up a few steps.  I've had Kuma's Corner bookmarked for a couple of months now, only to keep drooling until that time came when I'd be able to sink my teeth into the burger.  I've been craving a grandiose burger like a pregnant woman craves pickles and peanut butter so when my fiance suggested that we try out Kuma's Corner I was like \"Oh, hell to the yes!\"  I was so pumped and boy, was I ready.  I even had on my kick-ass, perfectly ripped t-shirt that says 'Beer is Food'.  I was definitely ready for this adventure.  I could barely contain all of my excitement while we were in the car, on the way to the restaurant.<br><br>When we got there it was fairly crowded, but that was to be expected given that we had arrived at around 9 pm on a Friday night during the summer.  Why wouldn't it be busy?  I've heard that this place is always, always, always busy so I was well-prepared to wait for at least 45 minutes.  There was absolutely no way that I was going to deny myself the opportunity to experience this burger!  There were about 4 parties ahead of us and we were projected to have to wait for about an hour to an hour and a half, but the hostess said that we could eat at the bar if we found a spot.  Although the wait wasn't bad (especially given that we had some beers to remedy our waiting time) it was cramped.  Kuma's Corner isn't very spacious, but like I said, no worries because I had my Three Floyd's beer.  Yes, you heard me.  Three Floyd's beer.  I found out that there is always some rotating Three Floyd's beer on draft - my fiance and I were lucky enough to pick from 3 different Three Floyd's beers on tap.  Lucky, lucky us.  <br><br>While we were waiting we had the pleasure of watching a cheesy 80's horror flick on the screen above the bar and listen to some head-banging, hair-whipping music.  Yes, I did whip my hair back and forth.  It was a very cool vibe in there - perfect for one of those nights where you just don't really give a shit (excuse my french).<br><br>At this point, you're probably reading and saying \"Yeah, yeah - so what?\" so I will break the beat down for ya.  You cannot go wrong on any of the burgers or food choices.  The only advice I can give you is this: Do not order a burger just for the band its named after, especially if you don't like what's on it.  That may have been obvious, but I'm just putting my two cents in.  My fiance ordered the Pantera burger and I ordered the Lair of Minotaur burger, which was freaking fabulous.  Now, usually I order my burgers well-done (which I'm thinking is a huge mistake), but instead I ordered my burger done medium - BEST DECISION EVER.  The juices of the burger ran all down my arm and it was undoubtedly the messiest burger I've ever eaten, but oh my goodness, it was worth every grease-filled droplet running down my arm.  The Lair of Minotaur has pancetta, provolone and a bourbon-glazed pear on top of it - need I say more?  Oh, and these burgers - they are not for the faint of heart.  They are huge and you will surely have to mentally prepare yourself to eat the entire thing because you do not want to waste a single bite of it!  The fries are also delicious, but good luck eating those if you plan on eating all of your burger.  I advise you to come with a very hungry stomach because there is not a single thing that you're going to want to leave on your plate.<br><br>Just a note - it can get kind of steamy in the restaurant because not only is it small, but the cooks are also making the burgers right near the dining area/bar.  On one hand, it makes the restaurant smell orgasmic, but on the other hand it makes you want to strip down to bare essentials.<br><br>Anyways, this concludes my mind-altering experience that I had at Kuma's Corner and I can sleep at night, knowing that I had one of the best burgers in Chicago.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fNjZ-j2UGvTJEiSiOHeE_g/348s.jpg", "caption": "And this is Pantera"}, {"url": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lVs57Q5PAhlAp963Zu_5Rg/168s.jpg", "caption": "Lair of minotaur burger"}, {"url": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QFIXWakSU2eIHUNfIB9tWw/168s.jpg", "caption": "Jalapeño poppers and hibiscus beer"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Kuma's Corner has received National Attention for it's delicious burgers.

I make sure there is no more burger left on the plate..<br> <br>To sum it up, this is one fine burger.. The setting is fun.. Especially for someone traveling alone, sitting at the bar..

For those with an attention span better than that of a squirrel, READ ON!<br><br>I came here on a Sunday at about 11:20, knowing that they opened at 12. As it turned out, I got here at just about the right time. There were already about ten people in line. I read that there are insane wait times for Kuma's Corner, so I wanted to beat the rush. At about 11:45, Kuma's decided to let people in. I got sat in the back (See pictures I added), and ordered a beer. For those wondering, I went with a Dreadnaught by Three Floyds, which ran $10 a pint -- about the price I was expecting, given the quality of the beer and the ABV.<br><br>Within a few minutes, I got my order taken and decided to have the Plague Bringer. Being a huge fan of \"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives\", I wanted to get the Black Sabbath burger, but I felt compelled to get something that seemed \"new\" to me. The Plague Bringer, having roasted garlic mayo, crushed garlic, housemade hot sauce, jalapenos, tortilla strips, lettuce, tomato, and onion, did that for me. I should also note that I decided to get the burger medium rare, even though I normally get my meat cooked medium.<br><br>For the love of God. Half of the 9.5% ABV pint of Dreadnaught may have had an effect on my opinion of the burger, but I was far from drunk -- I've had plenty of intoximeals where the food wasn't anywhere near as good as this.<br><br>The Plague Bringer basically blew me away. First of all, it's monstrous. I took some pics, but it doesn't do it justice at all. With the bun on, the 10oz burger with all of the toppings has to be nearly five inches tall. You'd better have a wide mouth, otherwise you'll just have to eat this with a knife and fork (wimp...). Everything about the Plague Bringer makes me crave it right now. Obviously, the perfectly cooked, juicy burger makes me want to dive in, but the spice from the jalapenos and fantastic house-made hot sauce. The crunch and flavor of the tortilla strips that somehow stay perfectly crispy with all of the juices from the burger... I can't get over it.<br><br>My friend went and got the Black Sabbath burger, to which he simply said was \"Good.\" He wasn't nearly as impressed with his burger ... I assume that's a combination of being completely sober and his burger choice. I have no doubts in my mind that even if I hadn't had any beer whatsoever (wasn't much to begin with), that I'd be just as in love with the Plague Bringer.<br><br>For $13, you actually get an impressive value. The 10oz burger is slightly bigger than the normal half pounder, and obviously almost twice that of a 6oz burger. If that's not enough for you, you get a generous portion of fries. The fries aren't anything to write home about, but if you couldn't already tell, THE DAMN PLAGUE BRINGER IS!<br><br>Absolutely, 100%, no doubt, I'll be back to Kuma's (Not KUMAR'S... why are some people calling it Kumar's!?) when I'm in Chicago... and I'll *try* to get something different.

It was that good. I had the Plague bringer which was just a mess of a burger covered in hot sauce, garlic, garlic mayo, jalapeños, tortilla chips, truly the best burger I have ever eaten! My boyfriend got the slayer, which is the featured video on the Food network. Which if you want to be enticed to check this place out, I highly recommend watching. The slayer is a giant burger on a bed of fries covered in andouille sausage, chili, cheese, and just a mess of deliciousness. My boyfriend was extremely satisfied with it! Although our main entrees was more than enough to have us stuffed, the appetizers were extremely enticing, and we had to try the jalapeños poppers, which were cream cheese and chorizo stuffed with raspberry jalapeño jam. So delicious and definitely worth being so full! The atmosphere is great, it has a heavy metal/rock vibe and truly the best food I had in Chicago/ maybe anywhere.

Plus, my two cents are always necessary so I'll try to make this review as insightful and helpful as I can to anyone who has never been. We came on a Saturday night around 6pm and got super lucky as I expected to get a 2+ hour wait time but for outside seating (and the weather was perfect) we were only quoted 45 minutes and the sweet girl with tattoos called my name in a half an hour. I mean a half an hour wait time on a Saturday night for a party of 4 on a beautiful summer day, that's a star in itself. <br><br>Okay so we sat down and after many of my friends recommended their famous mac n' cheese, I knew it was on the agenda. And thank god we ordered it since they do take a while for their burgers and we would have been starving waiting for them to cook. The mac n cheese is worth coming alone, it is the BEST I've ever had. This is what Kumas should really be known for since it was out of this world, I'm still dreaming about it day and night. It's $14 of heaven and includes two add ins so we got the prosciutto and the sun dried tomatoes. It was just something out of a fairy tale, I mean, I've had lobster mac n cheese in 5 star restaurants, but this was seriously the best, plus the portion is huge so we shared it among the four of us. <br><br>Now onto the burgers, one friend got the Led Zepplin with pulled pork which she thought was just okay, another got the Kumas Burger with the fried egg on top and she also thought it was pretty good. We got the Lair of the Minotaur which has caramelized onion, pancetta, brie, and bourbon poached pear. I saw that specific one on TV and thought it was the way to go. Honestly, it was just a okay, I've had my share of burgers and this was definitely not the best. It was almost too much meat and a thick bun making it super heavy. The pretzel bun wasn't as soft as I think it should be making it overall heavy and the pear was like soaked in the bourbon so it was also a little too much. It was huge and for $14 it should be, easily can be shared by two people. But after all the hype and wait to come have a burger, I wasn't overly impressed with it.<br><br>My overall impression of this place as it is super loud inside with the music blasting so I would only sit outside. Our server was super sweet and made sure everything came out right and on time. If it wasn't for that legendary mac n cheese, I would give this place only 3 stars but there's no way I would come back and risk the 3 hour wait for a mediocre burger! Message me if you want suggestions on my favorite burger place in Chicago as I feel that DMK, 25 Degrees and Abigails in Highland Park all do it better.", "pics": [{"url": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/y0YkuLv6sGtIpckBWQwI1g/348s.jpg", "caption": "Mac n cheese is amazing!!!"}]}}, {"review": {"des": "Great burgers in a hipster bar.  Only problem is this place gets CRAZY BUSY!<br><br>I was passing by a couple of days ago around 5pm and it didn't look crowded so I stopped in.  Sat at the bar near the kitchen and got a great show from the cooks.  <br><br>Very friendly crown despite the number of people there.<br><br>Probably one of the bust burgers in the City.<br><br>Also,  I ordered my burger medium and it was served just the way I like it.  Perfectly medium.  I saw some reviews where others complained about the temperature of the meat but I've never had that problem.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "It actually pains me a little bit to rate Kuma's anything less than 5 stars.

We were seated immediately. Pro tip: they won't seat you unless your whole party is there! Also take advantage of the beer specials!<br><br>I ordered the Lair of the Minotaur burger (pancetta, bourbon poached pears, brie) medium rare. It was more medium than medium rare but still really juicy so no complaints there. The pretzel bun was also really good at keeping everything together. It was greasy, but what else do you expect from a burger? The pears were really good and the brie was so, so rich. Gripes: I felt like the patty was underseasoned. It honestly didn't have that much taste even though I knew it was solid quality. I couldn't taste the pancetta either.<br><br>My boyfriend tried the Slayer burger, which was a RIDICULOUS amount of food. He eats a lot already and he was starving when we got there, but he only finished probably around half. I tried a couple of bites when we were there and it was pretty good - a little over the top for me, but hey, that's how Chicago does food. Unfortunately the overwhelming flavor for the Slayer is salt, so that made it a lot harder to eat. I couldn't tell from a few bites but he said that it was pretty much impossible to eat towards the end.<br><br>Anyways, Kuma's is worth trying if you're a burger fan, I'd say, but for us, it wasn't the best burger experience we've ever had.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Awesome burgers and fries!!

After I heard Kuma's was awarded Best Burger in the USA by the Daily Meal, it was mandatory that I finally see whether this was true or not. I'm obviously wiser now, but pre-Kumas trip, I talked about how stupid the people at Daily Meal were because it couldn't possibly be that good. (I said I'm wiser now, but I apologize to both Kumas and Daily Meal for doubting them both.)<br><br>My first time at Kumas, I went for the fried pickles and the Famous Kuma. The fried pickles were fantastic -- primarily because the batter was so thick and consistent, that it crunched when you bit into it. Sometimes the batter just ends up a sloppy mess, but theirs were perfect. We waited a loooong time for a table that I was starting to question whether I really wanted to stick around. However, the host and server were so nice to us and the food was fantastic, so it was worth it. <br><br>I've actually had Kuma's a total of 3 times now: Famous, Yob, and the August BOTOM Agent Orange. My favorite is the Yob so far, but I haven't found one I've been disappointed in.  My 2nd and 3rd time eating Kumas, we've done carryout and been so happy with our food, even after having to warm it up a little.<br><br>Kuma's Corner definitely has my favorite burger in Chicago and possibly my favorite burger in the entire universe.

I ordered the Kuma's burger. A fried egg on a burger isn't anything so unusual these days but Kuma's does it best. The egg is perfectly cooked and perfectly runny.

Enter: zebra wine (shout out to Trader Joe's!), brunch steak and eggs (Birchwood Kitchen FTW!!), and burgers. And that's where Kuma's Corner comes in. <br><br>In my opinion, the original locations of restaurants are usually superior to following openings, so we headed to Avondale for Kuma's Corner. It was a Monday night at around 8 PM when we got there, and there was NO WAIT!! A couple of tables were open, but we decided to sit at the bar since my friend and I are both fans of chatting with those around us. The bartender was extremely nice and made beer recommendations to us, let us sample a couple, and we settled on the Three Floyds' Gumballhead - it was delicious, a wheat ale with a strong hint of citrus. In the end of this harsh winter, it made me feel like I was basking in the summer sun. Apparently, their Three Floyds' tap rotates every month. Although, I'm scared that if I came back in summer, would the beer on tap remind me of winter and 6 inches of snow piled on my porch? Gosh, I hope not. <br><br>We then set to order and asked the bartender for her favorite burger. She said it was the Iron Maiden and we were sold - chipotle mayo, pepperjack, avocado, lettuce, and the works. It was delicious. The beef patty was juicy and thick, the avocado was plentiful, and the chipotle mayo was delicious. We also decided to order The Slayer, and boy it slayyyeddddd us. It was a deconstructed burger on a bed of fries, chili, sausage, cheese, green onions, and more. It was basically a heart attack on a plate, and believe me, if I had died after it, at least I knew I would have died happy. Although I love me a regular burger, I've never had anything like The Slayer before and I loved it. It was a mix of fries, nachos, a burger, and more. Everything I love came together in perfect harmony. I seriously can't stop thinking about it.<br><br>The wall art is fun to look at, the beer is great, burgers left us full and happy, and the service was good.

I certainly expected some attitude from the people working there.<br><br>Wow, what an oasis Kuma's turned out to be on a bitter cold night, if in your book a place that plays metal can be called an oasis. For me? It's situational (especially now that I've caught myself with a pre-judge-ice). Truth be told, I had originally intended to try my first bowl of Ramen at Wasabi. I had borrowed my friend's car for a few days, and the car was happy to humor me with a ride up there on a Sunday evening. With people waiting on the sidewalk and the temperature flirting with negative degrees (that's one optimistic, flirtatious temperature!), I looked at my Yelp bookmarks and saw Kuma's.<br><br>There were a few people outside, but they were smoking; so I didn't assume that there was a line. When I went in, there were probably a dozen people waiting, and I told the hosts that I just wanted a seat at the bar (classic, old school, to my liking, I might add). The bar was shoulder-to-shoulder, but the host went over to a group in the corner where most were waiting for a table and not drinking. One was more than willing to give me his seat. Kuma's waiting problem solved! In my mind, I apologized for expecting anyone to give me less than front-man, headliner-rock-star. \"HELLO CHICAGO!!!\" <br><br>Very friendly bartender, and efficient: my Jack on the rocks was in front of me in no time, along with a water back that I didn't even have to ask for. I probably had not earned the right to try the Kaijo, because I had never heard of the band. But if they're music is topped with bleu cheese and \"frizzled onion\" (the rock & roll hair!?!) I like it. Those ingredients are, indeed, part of my rock-'n-roll fantasy. And Kaijo? I just found some tunes on the Interwebs, and I'm listening as I write this, like my songs, on the back of a napkin with some Jack in my hand. Kaijo is another surprise that I didn't expect. It's not head-banging music, or even metal (unless you consider synthesizers metal, which would be like calling pressboard wood... and I love & used to play keyboards.

Well, the people. I came to Kuma's Corner understanding that it was a rough place, very unique and interesting. I did not expect it to be like any place in Lincoln Park or Lakeview that I frequent but I was okay with that. On that same note, I do not appreciate rudeness from staff for any reason. If I wanted to eat at Dick's Last Resort, I would have been treated better and not had to wait 45 minutes. <br><br>My roommate and I went on a Friday and we were there promptly at 11:30 am when Kuma's opens. Well, it was already packed. I do not mind waiting at all, it is a testament to amazing places in my experience. My roommate and I were able to snag a bar seat, only to have the bartender/waitress tell us that we couldn't sit there since my roommate is 20 (I'm 21). Well, since Kuma's has more bar space than table space (and it was 11:30 am) I was sort of outraged. She asked her manager if we could just sit and eat and he said absolutely not. We went back to the hostess and she informed us that in the time when we were trying to work out the bar seats debacle, three groups had come in and even though we had come in first, we would be moved to the back of the line. Alright, fine, whatever I'll wait the 45 minutes even though there were numerous bar seats open. <br><br>More and more people came flooding in as we waited by the window. I watched as they moved this poor group sitting at the bar five times during the course of their meal. I am not against switching tables or moving down a seat to allow more people to sit, but five times? They also carded two men who were older than my father. Really? Do you have to card everyone, even seventy year old men? All in all, I found every staff member (with the exception of the hostess and our waitress) to be extremely rude, unorganized, and not worthy of a tip. <br><br>Once we finally sat down, at a four person table with many groups of four waiting and getting very upset, our waitress did a great job. The food was amazing, I will not deny that I loved every bite of my heart attack on a bun. I had the Megadeth burger which I recommend if you like a little kick to your burger. My roommate had the YOB (red pepper) and she said it was fantastic. I am not a fan of red pepper (especially an entire half on my burger) but I will trust her judgement because she is an excellent cook herself. The fries were alright, I've had better at DMK. Our waitress kept our drinks coming and I appreciated it since my burger was burning my mouth (in a good way).<br><br>I will only comment on the stench and loudness of the music once. I left smelling like grease and grime since my roommate and I spent two hours in the establishment from start to finish. The music was extremely loud but I will accept that because this is the atmosphere of the business. I don't expect them to change the music and smell when I walk in just because I'm from Lincoln Park.<br><br>After hearing many amazing things about Kuma's, I expected this place to be outstanding. While I did get an amazing burger that I will be back for (and bring my father to when he comes to visit) the staff was extremely rude. I have sat at many bars and restaurants under the age of 21. What is  with this policy? Don't tell me that it's a law because, in that case, many high end establishments in Chicago broke the law by allowing me to sit at their bar and eat. Kuma's almost seems to try too hard at being cool. I'm all for metal and being unique but when being rude is your only attribute, you need to do a reality check.

The menu clearly says: NO VEGAN OPTIONS (kind of poking fun at vegans/ vegetarians - but hey, I get it.

Crazy, but just a little over hyped in my opinion. Always heard about the place but never made the journey out to try it. But with summer winding down, figured why not. Went on a Sunday after church and there was a small 5 min wait until a table opened up. Had a great waitress, Nikki I believe. She did a great job. Water refills were on point as well as the checking up on us was too. <br><br>Anyway, time came to order, and seeing as there are so many yelp reviews, there is no really consensus on which burger is the best. All these other yelpers that say all the burgers are good, you all stink since you don't help anyone out. Asked my waitress what her favs were and she said the Goatsnake and the Plague (which is the spiciest one there). Neither of those appealed to me so I went with the Slayer since some of the reviews said that one and I like chili. <br><br>First it doesn't come with a bun. She asked if that was ok since she knew I was a first timer but I didn't want to act dumb so I said sure. If I had a second choice then I def would have ordered something else. So the Slayer is just fries with a burger patty on top, covered in chili, and the chili has big sausage pieces in it too. It was pretty good, with the melted cheese and everything. Just wasn't my style. Burger meat was pretty bomb though. Ate that whole thing and then just took home chili cheese fries to eat later, not too bad of a deal. The girlfriend got the Lair of the Minotaur which I didn't really care for at all. <br><br>We also got the Mac and cheese and that thing was huge. But for 14 bucks, at least you get your money's worth. Added bacon and broccoli and you can mix and match other things. I personally didn't like it but after a day in the fridge and after reheating, it was pretty delicious the next morning for breakfast. <br><br>So yeah, burger meat is good, but it was just an alright experience for me.

People are in and out of here quickly. They have to be because it's so busy all the time from what I hear and what I saw. Feed 'em and turn that table over for the next party.

We never felt rushed and she was very attentive but not overly at the table. <br><br>Two people in our party ordered the Mastodon, I got the Zepplin burger and my buddy got the Plague Bringer. We heard they use to serve waffle fries which are no longer in existence here. But the fresh cut fries they served were delicious and actually fresh! Way to go, Kuma's!<br><br>They are a little on the pricey side for a burger joint but you are paying for a quality meal, large portions (therefore: leftovers!) and a whole unique dining experience. Good tip: They won't split the bill amongst multiple credit cards, but will accept cash for part of the bill and a credit card for the balance. If you are anything like us and our friends, we never carry cash, so this is important to know. <br><br>They are known for their Kuma burger that is served with Bacon, Cheddar, and a Fried Egg and I heard from a lot of people that this is a killer option. My buddy actually added a fried egg to his Plague Bringer- 2 bucks extra, but from what I understand, totally worth it!<br><br>Dinner for the 4 of us- about $100 including an app priced the same as all 4 of our meals. I have no problem spending $100 for 4 people to have burgers if we have a fun dining experience with great food, good friends and just a fun atmosphere.<br><br>Bring the kids on down, jump on your Harley (stop and pick me up on the way), get on the train, grab the next bus...do what you gotta do, just get over here before you waste your money on some crappy burger at your local grill.

Like, nothing you'd expect in your grandmother's living room. Or the living room of my friends. My favorite was of an otherwise cute bear that had blood around it's mouth and neck and a caption that said, \"meat.\" Some of the other selections are kind of pornographic.

I got bronchitis!\" There is a haze of smoke in the air. A thick one that permeates your clothes and hair. It reminded me of when people used to smoke in bars and clubs and I'd wake up smelling like cigarettes and good memories. Only this smoke is laden with grease and good times which is a much healthier kind of smoke, IMHO. But really, I had to shower after Kuma's.<br><br>I don't feel right commenting on the service because our table had a secret weapon. We had Nikki C (the Duke of Kuma's Corner AND fledgling Kuma's Too) as our guide. He told us when to arrive, where to sit, and the entire staff knew him and treated us well because of it. Still, we respected Kuma's rule to only have one credit card per table. I navigated the crowd to the ATM by the door and withdrew extra cash to pay my dues.<br><br>Of course we went for the food. Nikki C had us order mac and cheese for our table of four. It had broccoli and bacon in it. It's like, why doesn't mac and cheese ALWAYS have broccoli and bacon? I'm not sure because they were naturals. The broccoli wasn't soggy, falling apart mess but held it's own amongst the soft pasta and gooey cheese. The top of it was crispy with bread crumbs or something. It was a really lovely combination of textures and flavors. We all loved it, but one order for the table was practically too much.<br><br>By the time my Iron Maiden came I could only stomach a quarter of it. It was good and I enjoyed it, but the mac and cheese (and my banana beer) filled the hollow space inside of me. The pretzel buns used by Kuma's are really incredible and make the burgers special. The fries really were not impressive (especially considering the fact that they were cut fresh from potatoes that same morning). I don't know what to say about them other than that I think I could do more with frozen fries from Jewel. \"Aint nobody got time for that!\"<br><br>I would definitely recommend this Kuma's Corner experience.

A friend of mine who is visiting Chicago from the golden hills of California had been regaled with fantastic tales of adventures at Kuma's Corner and wanted to see for herself if the legends were true. As we arrived at Kuma's Corner and had a seat at the bar looked over the menu and decided to both settle on the same entree. Before I further delve into the tale of the consumption of said beef and bread combination I will first attempt to familiarize you with the atmosphere of this particular establishment.<br><br>Kuma's Corner is a heavy metal themed bar and grill. You'll find various album covers and other homages to metal bands on the walls and behind the bar. All of the entrees are named after musical acts such as Metallica, Megadeath and Mac & Cheese (okay, so maybe not that one). It's fairly small on the inside with a kitchen that is visible from the bar that is around the size of an office cubicle. <br><br>In visiting Kuma's Corner on this occasion I decided to try the Pantera. The Pantera is a burger with pepper, two kinds of cheese, bacon and fritos, I had mine cooked medium well, and I was very pleased with the texture, taste and seasoning of the beef. The pepper on top reminded me of those often found in Mexican dishes and was the most noticeable flavor in the dish. The overall balance was decent but I didn't taste the bacon or cheeses as much as the pepper and fritos. <br><br>Overall my food was excellent and I highly recommend Kuma's Corner for those interested in trying out unique burgers.

The burgers fall in line with that and are pricy at $13-$15 each. I will say that you do get a lot of food and I noticed after we ordered that a handful of their burgers are on special for $8. Look at their beer list for the burgers on special, I think it is only if you order them during a certain time of day. The beer list is great and the metal vibe was cool and what I expected.

I mean these burgers are meant for Mic Jaggar's mouth. The buns were good too. The meat quality does not seem great, not bad, just not great and there is little to no flavor to the meat itself. Maybe with so many great toppings they figure they do not need to do much to the meat itself. And the toppings were great and tasty. Best burgers ever? I don't think so, but unique and cool to try. The burgers were cooked exactly as we ordered them (medium rare). <br><br>I think all the \"Best Burgers In the Universe\" talk is mainly hype and people going there get caught up in it and all the interesting burgers.

(At first I thought that was funny until we got charged for something that the Waitress told us came with our burgers)  The no changes comes off as a litte arrogant but it is probably because they run there kitchen like the gourmet McDonald's...don't make any changes and keep pushing out food.

We had just enough time to order beers at the bar before a table opened up for us on the patio. Apparently this short wait time was very atypical, a result of the unpleasant weather. We got our fair share of suffering after we sat down. We didn't get our burgers until a full hour after we ordered, and we were completely at the mercy of the miserable weather. (For the record, it was even hotter inside.) Our waitress was pleasant and reasonably attentive, so I can't complain too much about the service. Just know that there's probably no such thing as a hassle-free dinner at Kuma's.<br><br>We kept ourselves entertained with a series of beers off the extensive draft list. Matt and I drank Left Hand Milk Stout, Iron Maiden Trooper Ale, Greenbush Anger black IPA, and New Belgium Snapshot wheat ale. It was all pretty great beer, and necessary stalls for our burgers.<br><br>We also had a bit to eat right away. The four of us split an order of mac and cheese loaded with garlic and prosciutto, and this came out almost an hour before the burgers. The mac was pretty epic, cheesy and flavorful and loaded up with both add-ins. Some of the best mac I've had, and I've had my fair share.<br><br>By the time the burgers came, we were so tired and overheated that it was actually difficult to eat. I am ashamed to admit that I was barely able to make it through a quarter of my burger. Very sad, because I could tell it was delicious, even though I couldn't physically bring myself to put away a heavy burger in pre-rainstorm Chicago summer humidity. Kuma's does fantastic burgers, with beautiful juicy patties on soft but sturdy pretzel buns. Really some of the best burgers you're likely to find anywhere. I had the High On Fire, which came topped with sriracha, roasted red pepper, prosciutto, grilled pineapple, and Mae Ploy sweet chile paste. The sweet and spicy elements were just right with the savory deep meatiness of the patty. I wish I had this burger in front of me right now. With my AC on, I'd eat the whole thing in ten bites. My husband's Mastodon was another great burger, a Kuma's standby with bacon, barbecue sauce, sharp cheddar, and frizzled onion.<br><br>Next time I'm in Chicago, I have to go back to Kuma's and avenge myself on these burgers.

I'd been wanting to try Kuma's for a long time, but how often do you want to schlep to Avondale and wait multiple hours? Came by with Walann R., Katie R., and Liz B. and were quoted an hour. Kuma's is even smaller than I imagined, but our wait only lasted about 45 minutes before we were seated. I can't even imagine the wait times during peak meal hours or weekends. Monday at 1:30 PM was a good choice. Our waitress came over right away with the beer list and menu. She was very helpful and attentive throughout our meal.<br><br>After choosing from Kuma's extensive beer list, we also decided to go with the mac and cheese for an appetizer. It had come highly recommended from friends and did not disappoint. We added corn, sundried tomatoes, and (obviously) bacon. This dish came in a huge portion and the four of us had no chance of finishing it. Solid item to split before your burgers arrive. For lunch, we all went with different items and were all thrilled with our choices. I split the Led Zeppelin and Plague Bringer with a friend. They were both fantastic and complimented each other well. First, the Led Zeppelin has tender pork shoulder on top of the burger with a really tasty BBQ sauce. Simple and delicious, cheddar and pickles this one out. On the other side of the Kuma's spectrum was the Plague Bringer. So much garlic, but in the best way ever. This patty was also cooked to perfection and topped with the regulars plus hot sauce, jalapeno, and tortilla strips. All of these components added an insane amount of flavor and it wasn't too spicy. It's also worth nothing that the buns that both of these burgers came on were sturdy enough to hold it together, hugely important. <br><br>Overall, go to Kuma's at an off-hour for a phenomenal meal. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and will definitely be back, as this is potentially the best burger I've had in Chicago.

I SAY THEE NAY!  Ragnarök is of course real and I'm sure the experts and internet pundits were all dead-on with their date guesstimate.  So what pray tell could have possibly happened to allow us to escape the most metal of all apocalypses?

Kuma's Corner of Avondale saved us all. <br><br>That's the only logical explanation that my brilliant mind has been able to come up with after pondering for months.  The Norse Gods must have partaken in these legendary burgers, no doubt to celebrate what is known across the 9 worlds as the best in Midgard, knowing that the end was nigh and this wouldst be their only chanceth to doeth so.  <br><br>After consuming these pretzel-breaded vessels of meat they found it worthy of the Æsir and rivaling any sustenance that can be found in Asgard!  The Gods must have found it so pleasing in fact that they vowed to CANCEL THE APOCALYPSE for it wouldst be a crime against all the realms to allow such magnificent creations to cease in existence. <br><br>Realizing this, they not only found something worth fighting for - but the source of their salvation as well!  They must have gathered all the burgers that the chefs and line cooks could create and tasked Víðarr to cast a number of them into the maws of Fenrisúlfr, the monster of the river Ván.  In doing so Víðarr made the wolf his bitch (Fenrisúlfr was a girl, who knew?) and tamed the savage beast for all eternity!  <br><br>Afterwords, Þórr likely took the rest of the massive amounts of meat, meade and bread and cast it down the gullet of Jörmungandr.  Having had his hunger and anger sated, the great Midgard Serpent must have fallen into the greatest of all food comas and the world was spared his writhes and wrath!<br><br>So remember this the next time you complain about the lines being too long (oh boo-hoo, let's fault an establishment for being too popular!) the limited space (it's not like they could've bought out the whole neighborhood, they opened a second location already - what more do you want?) the music being too loud (it's METAL, it HAS to be played loud! What better way to celebrate victory over Gotterdammerung?) or the portions being too much and the ingredients being too supercilious (this is MERICA, cut your burger in half and quit your bitchin!  What are you doing using highfalutin words like supercilious anyway?!)<br><br>When the end of the world does finally come and I want to eat my last burger, you can find me at Kuma's stuffing down the Burger of the month, chasing it with hand-cut fries dipped in their mac & cheese, while drinking whiskey straight from the tap Homer Simpson-style.

Anyway, they have good ciders, I do remember that. The burgers (for those lucky enough to be able to eat them with wheat buns) are huge and awesome.

I didn't even finish watching the show. I was out the door. I'm really lucky I live on the Brown line. Just hop the train to Belmont and thumb a cab. About $5-$6 later you're at the door of one of the most original eating experiences I have had in Chicago. It's a metal bar, which I'm used to, an amazing beer selection, also used to, and an eclectic menu of ground beef mastery, Which I was not used to. I have had the first two one at a time but never all brought together into one place. If you're on the fence give it a chance. <br><br>The beer selection is bursting at the seams with diversity. <br>They didn't have any beers like Pabst which I didn't understand at first but I honestly think it would take away from the whole experience. They bring flavors together in their menu that are enhanced by their amazing beer selection. No complaints about that. <br><br>There is Whiskey on Tap. Which was also a first for me. <br>To sum it up, No Crap on Tap.<br><br>Everyone that works there is amazing too. They kinda blend in with the crowd. Every time I walk in I confuse the woman taking names at the door for someone waiting for a seat. Even though it's always packed they are incredibly accommodating. You're gonna wait. First thought, \"Is it worth it?\" Every second. <br><br>My first time there I got \"The Slayer\". I had met a couple at the bar who were there after seeing the same show. We bought each other a few rounds and ended up sharing. \"The Slayer\" is a hot mess. A hot, delicious mess. The best ingredient being ANGER. I couldn't finish even half of it. I took it home and well my dog got into it while I wasn't looking.  She seemed just as pleased..<br><br>The next time I got \"The Nail\" which was the monthly special at the time.<br><br>Serrano Chile Paste<br>Bacon<br>Mint/Basil Chimichurri<br>Pulled Pork<br>Smoked Gouda<br>Fried Mint Garnish <br><br>You really can't go wrong with any of their monthly specials. <br><br>From there I got \"The Plague Bringer\" which is my \"go to\" burger. Try it..repeat. <br><br>Then enter \"The Ghost\". The best \"Damned\" burger I've experienced thus far. I even had a reporter ask for an interview amid the \"scandal\". <br><br>Hi Chris! <br>I'm writing from Good Morning America.

Crispy, crunchy and great flavor. But the pickles had no bite , there was no acid taste or dill. So it was more like eating fried zucchini which of course is never a bad thing but we were hoping for pickle.  We also ordered a custom Mac and cheese. We chose andouille sausage, tomato and scallion. This Mac was out of this world. I was very impressed. But the thing is for me, I like my food hot and my drinks cold. The Mac was barely warm. The top layer of cheese was hot but underneath the Mac was room temp at best. It was still great. But for me would have been worthy of going back for if served hot.  To be fair it was freezing in the restaurant. When we took bites of pickles you could see our breath and heat from pickles in the air.  We finished with the neurosis burger which boasted horseradish and mushroom. The burger was huge. But I am not a fan of these giant patties of beef. I think several thin patties make for better bites. But the beef was great and perfectly seasoned.  I didn't get the bite of horseradish at all except in maybe one bite of the burger.  We were sharing and my better half said he did taste it so maybe it was just me. The only bad thing about this burger was the mushrooms. They were cold. They had good  flavor but cold mushrooms on a burger end up just being a slimy afterthought. So I was a bit disappointed. Also , truly the fries were awful. Some were soggy and cold and others were burned. They were all shriveled up and seemed to be the bottom of a batch of fresh cut that soaked too long. We didn't even eat them. Very disappointing. The server and employees were all awesome, attentive and it was a fun atmosphere.  To me, this would be a bar I would go to drink heavily at and the burger would be a bonus as well as the Mac. But I don't think I would go back for just the food. To me the fries and the temp of the food was a deal breaker.  I'll stick to au cheval for my burger cravings.

When looking for places to visit while I was in town with some friends, what immediately caught my attention was the metal themed burger menu. Being fans of the genre, this place was where we were headed. It totally lived up to the expectations and more. Initially, we were afraid we weren't going to be able to try a burger because the wait time was three hours so I definitely recommend getting there early enough to grab a table. Luckily, we managed to get a couple of stools at the bar and ate in shifts with our friends. <br><br>I ordered the Slayer burger which was a 10 oz. patty on a bed of fries with cherry peppers, andouille sausage, chili, caramelized onion, green onion, and smothered in gooey Monterey Jack cheese. It was a sloppy delicious mess that reflected a crazy Kerry King guitar solo and it was the perfect way to start off our adventure that night. One friend ordered the Plague Bringer and he was blown away by it and said that he would be back soon to sample more of the menu. Another friend, who just moved to Chicago, sampled the Neurosis burger that he thoroughly enjoyed. At one point, one of my friends walked over to the kitchen, exclaimed, \"You guys fucking rule!\"and I'm pretty sure they appreciated that sentiment. <br><br>The atmosphere is just perfect for this place. The music, the beers, the food, the service, the staff, is all grade A awesomeness. After dinner, we chatted it up with a few locals who we gave our seats to and they recommended another great place for us to check out. <br><br>I plan on coming back to Chicago next summer just so I can go to Kuma's Corner again.<br><br>This place really does fucking rule!

Dismiss.<br>2) 20% or more of yelp reviews probably goosed along by the proprietor. Look for more rah-rah type drek without a single counterpoint. Dismiss.<br>3) Never trust any review that begins \"THESE BURGERS ROCK, DUDE!\" and then goes on to offer no proof or evidence. <br><br>So which Yelp reviews do you trust? Simple. Mine. What's the evidence? Read my other reviews--every single one a detailed, well-reasoned argument, and they're fun to read, too.<br><br>So on to Kuma's. Frankly, I was frightened to go--not because of the Corrosion of Conformity heavy metal decor, but something scarier: the lemmings. Yuppie lemmings have taken over this place, which made me wonder if Kuma's was all reputation and little substance. (See my review for Hot Dougs.) <br><br>Turns out I was wrong. <br><br>Kuma's Corner surprised me, but not for the reasons you might think. The burgers are good, very good in fact (but not great). It's the outstanding SERVICE here that shocked me.<br><br>The only true test was to go in at the height of lemming rush hour--at 12:30 in the afternoon--and while there was no line outside, the foyer was plenty packed. But within 45 seconds a hostess spotted me and said, \"How many, sir?\" Indicating it was just me, I expected exile in Wait List Hell.

Wow.<br><br>My bar perch offered me an ideal view of the kitchen. I didn't see any Marshall stack amplifiers back there, but a few wiry cooks beavered away at the grill with the intense concentration of Kirk Hammett hammering out pile-driver riffs. <br><br>I ordered the Mastadon burger: BBQ sauce, frizzled onions, served by a rocker in kabuki makeup and 7-inch stiletto heels wailing at the top of his shredded falsetto voice. (Eh, just kidding ... but it would be a nice touch for the soccer moms if Kuma's ever opens up a Schaumburg branch.)<br><br>Kuma's is small. The bar holds maybe 20 people on a good day, and the dining room not that many more. But the burgers are big. Too big, I think. That's the only complaint I have about the massive Mastadon, which was delicious mess of dripping, sweet BBQ and generously piled onion string. And ah, the burger itself: A juicy, tender, slightly smoky patty of grilled bliss on a big-ass pretzel bun. <br><br>But ... it had me reeling in a semi-food coma before I was halfway done. They should offer lighter bites on the burger side, though I suppose Kuma's would lose some of its Hammer of Thor charm.<br><br>And sorry, burger fans, but while they're serving very high-quality beef here, there's nothing grass fed, so my sources tell me (the healthiest and arguably tastiest cut). If you're looking for that kind of burger nirvana, try Edzo's in Evanston, the best I've had to date. (But make sure to go at 11 a.m., before the Evanston Lemmings arrive.)<br><br>But again, the burgers are fab here and the service rocked, at least on my visit. I chatted up the hostess after the meal (not revealing my identity as the Yelp Skeptic) and she told me that Kuma's really is family. I believe her. Everyone there treated me like they wanted me to come back, even though I'd take the Clash, the Jam or even Britney Spears over Pantera or Pig Destroyer any day. All that sorcerers-of-death decor and the drone of industrial sludge in the background only convinced me further how funny almost all heavy metal is--except for Spinal Tap, which is really friggin' funny.<br><br>Next time back, maybe I'll try the Led Zeppelin without the pickles.

See ya'll there!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Having the week off from work, cabin fever &  a rare 70+ degree April day made me decide to FINALLY scratch this place off the bucket list.  I'd been dying to try this for years.  After hearing about all the horrible waits (and having tried to go before to only have a 2.5 hr wait), I figured a weekday lunch would probably have the least wait time.  <br><br>I got there around 11:45 after circling the area for 10 minutes to find parking.  I parked in the Burger King the next street down, throwing caution to the wind & thinking I should be good for the 1-2 hrs lunch may require.  I walked in expecting a wait & was told if I wanted a table, it'd be 15 minutes or I could sit at the bar.  I decided to sit at the bar as I was alone.    <br><br>I was handed two menus, one for beer & one for food.  There were probably 50 or so beer choices  & about 13 burger options.  I was quickly waited on by a very friendly, tatted & pierced bartender. As I had driven an hour  & was off work, I had a beer.   My beer (2 Brothers Ebels Weiss) and water both came quickly.  Having studied the menu ad nauseum, I ordered the Mastodon (BBQ sauce, bacon, cheddar, frizzled onions) & fries.  Figured I'd stick with a basic before going for fancier burger for the first time.   Tip:  if you go M-Fri for lunch, they have a lunch special where you can get a small list of burgers for $5 which are about half the size of the normal burgers.  <br><br> I waited for about 15-20 minutes for my burger & took in all the ambience, complete with Mortal Kombat movie on the big HD TV. The place is just as I'd read about:  small with about 10 tables and maybe 10-15 stools at the bar, hot  & loud.   It was hot in there, even with the door open, but not ungodly hot.  After a cold winter, it felt kinda nice actually.  It's also loud.  I was actually disappointed since I was expecting the music to be the loud part but the crowd was louder than the metal music I wanted to listen to.  So, be forewarned.  <br><br>As I waited for my food, a friendly regular sat next to me with some advice:  1) Every burger is awesome 2) it's best to come at lunch during the weekday.  If you come on a weekend,  come in small numbers so you can minimize wait time by eating at the bar &  3) determine what matters most to you, the food or the ambience.  If the food is a bigger priority, go to Kuma's Too, their satellite location.  It's larger with same menu & little wait times.  If you want the true Kuma's ambience, be prepared to wait.  I also asked about Lockdown, which I'd read also has burgers just as good if not better as Kumas'.  He said Lockdown burgers are great but Kumas are better.  I'll try to experience Lockdown soon to see for myself.  <br><br>OK, enough rambling.  Onto the grub.  The Mastodon was damn near perfect. EASILY the best burger I've had in Illinois & right up there with the Cherry Cricket burger in Denver.    It was at least 8 oz, big soft fresh pretzel bun, perfectly cooked bacon & very crisp, crunchy onion frizzles.  The BBQ sauce was very tasty as well.  Could've used a BIT less of it.   The burger was cooked to a perfect medium.  I was hoping it'd be a little juicier, but I was stunned at how savory & perfectly seasoned the meat was.  The burger came with a big pile of fries, which were piping hot & drizzled with sea salt.  The fries, after about 5-10 minutes to become cool enough for me, were very tasty as well.  Nice, hot, soft and a little salty...just the way I like them & my women!  As my meal was about over, so was my beer.  The waitress asked if I wanted another.  Fearing a possible tow and gastric distress on the commute home, I asked for my check & a t-shirt from the place since I love the logo...and the grub.  My check was completely taken care of within minutes.  My full belly & I waddled happily down the block to see my car was still there...and it was. <br><br>All in all, an excellent experience.  The only downside was the hour drive to & from the place.    If it wasn't an hour or so drive, I'd be here ALOT more often.  That awesome of a burger & fries for $13?  BARGAIN!!   However, I'm told a Kuma's location is opening in Woodfield Mall in July, which will not only be significantly larger but significantly closer (30 minutes).    I cannot wait!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "The quintessential Burger bar.  I wouldn't exactly call myself a fan-boy of Heavy Metal (nor, I suppose, would anyone who is an actual fan of Heavy Metal) but the decor, music and general motif makes Kuma's a site to check off your bucket list.  And that's without even counting the food, which fully lives up to its much deserved hype.<br><br>I've tried countless burgers and they have all been outstanding.  If I really want to get after it I order the Slayer, which is more like my hometown \"Garbage Plate\" than a classic burger. If not the Slayer, I'll usually try a special, which was once a fried burger stuffed with cheese, which I assure you was every bit as good as it sounds.  The fries are great and the make-your-own Mac n Cheese is outstanding. I usually add mushrooms, bacon and 2-3 other things and bring it home for later (very easy to heat it up in a skillet).  I don't think Kuma's as clearly makes up for the annoying wait as its encased meats neighbor, Hot Doug's, (since there's also the very awkward vulture situation with seats at the bar).

The burger was seasoned perfectly and the inside was juicy and pink. It is served with house made chips or fires. I went with the chips and they were great as well.

She told me now (2:30p-ish on some day that ends in y). I went. BTW, that little trick works great for the DMV. But I suggest simply speaking to the people that work there.

Finally my friend and I decided to chance it on a Monday afternoon around 5 pm. Surprise -- the place was half empty.<br><br>We started off by splitting the mac & cheese with bacon and peas. Holy crap -- BEST MAC AND CHEESE EVER. I'd like to think I've tried many mac & cheeses in my day, and Kuma's definitely ranks in the top 5. The cheese was creamy and bubbly with a perfectly crisp crust, and the peas & bacon were the perfect touch.<br><br>Unfortunately -- and it pains me to say this -- the famous Kuma Burger didn't live up to my expectations. Perhaps it was because everyone had built it up so much, or maybe it was because I was already stuffed by the time it came around. Either way, I found the burger to be overcooked, underseasoned, and oversalted. I like my buns soft and buttery, because it lets the meat take center stage, but the pretzel bun was chewy to the point of distraction. I won't say the burger was bad, because it wasn't, but it lacked the balance that I've found in gourmet burgers. I also tried my friend's Mastodon and found it to be average at best.<br><br>Service was slow and inattentive, which made the fact that they had no AC all the more unbearable in the summer heat.<br><br>Kuma's is worth a visit if you're a hardcore foodie, but I highly doubt it's the best burger in Chicago.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Kuma's is still very good but I think the little things might be slipping just a bit.<br><br>Waffle fries?

We waited over 20 minutes for a server, and no one came. We went to the bar to order our beers (first two choices were 'unavailable', even though they were featured specials. Back at our table, the screeching metal music was so obnoxiously loud that our drinks were moving on the table. We asked to be moved outside. <br><br>Once outside, we placed our drink and food orders for four people, one of whom was around the corner returning to the restuarant. No problems were pointed out at this point. After waiting 20 minutes, our friend sat down, just for our server to explain that they 'do not accept joiners'. I understand the idea that had he waited to place an order until over 20 minutes after ours, it would have been a problem, but all our orders had gone in at the same time. To save time here, I will shorten and say that we argued with the server, (who had pushed our three orders through, but held the fourth back), who got the manager, who swore at us and said it was all about 'turning tables' before stomping off with an unresolved issue. We explained that we would pay for our drinks, but that if they would not let us eat as a table, then we were going to leave. They walked away, without a word. Once they realized that our food would go unpaid for, they slammed down four plates and a bill, never returning to the table again. We had to pay seperately, and everyone lost their appetite over the needless arguing. <br><br>Our servers final words to us were: \"You'd better not write a bad Yelp review\" - So here you go you snarky little lady. <br><br>Looking back, I shouldnt have paid for the burgers, and it was $90 of wasted money and almost 4 hours of wasted time.

It was so amazing that I've made it my goal to replicate it at home, no matter how long it takes.  Creamy but still gooey and the smoke was just gorgeous.  Velvety and beautiful.  Bravo.  <br><br>I ordered the PlagueBringer burger which was cooked perfectly medium, on a brioche roll.  The highlights of the burger were the meat itself (I have a sneaking suspicion that they grind their own meat, the texture was just so beautiful), a roasted garlic aioli and sliced fresh jalapenos.  And the fries.  The fries are delightful.  Perfectly crispy and nice dark golden color with kosher (not table) salt.  Not a burned or undercooked fry in the bunch.  Truly a work of art.  I am a big girl.  I had to take half of my burger and some of the fries home.  I can't tell you the last time I took a burger in a doggy bag, if indeed ever.<br><br>My husband ordered the Slayer burger which forgoes a bun and just puts the beef patty on a pile of the same bad a$$ fries with a pretty good chili (the one place I thought the food could be a little better.

Olympus (cue heralding trumpets, rays of sunshine).<br><br>My fave is the Megadeth. Chorizo and tortilla strips on a burger is just so right (its toppings also include red potato hash, pico de gallo, and avocado). I haven't seemed to be able to order anything else since I've had it. My first time at Kuma's I had the Judas Priest, which has bacon, apples, walnuts and dried cranberries. It was good, but the topping to meat ratio was off. There is a LOT of meat in these burgers. Good meat. Order yours medium rare and you will get it perfectly cooked, well-seasoned and delicious. The pretzel bun is the perfect wrapping for this gift from the food coma heavens.<br><br>The restaurant is super small, so large groups are not a good idea. By large, I mean like four or more. I've always just come with my boyfriend and we've never waited more than 20-30 minutes, but most of the time we can just snag bar seats within 15. And sitting at the bar is awesome because you have faster access to all the beers. And they have banana bread beer. Need I say more? I will anyway. The bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable; tip them accordingly.<br><br>You will definitely slip into a deep slumber after eating at Kuma's, and you will dream of bouncing up and down on huge meat patties while being showered in tortilla strips and craft beer. It is not recommended to operate heavy machinery or do anything productive for a few hours.<br><br>I want so desperately to give Kuma's the 5-star rating it deserves!

The burgers are a full 10oz of juicy tender meat piled high with toppings and served on a pretzel bun. In case you were wondering, the bun is made of the same dough as a pretzel but isn't shaped like the traditional bow. Which is good as you'd be spilling even more of your food down your shirt and we'd have to make you wear a bib and nobody looks good in bibs.<br><br>The fries are crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The waffle fries are always a good treat. A pretty wide range of quality beers (and I mean quality...not just variations of Bud and Miller) will help wash down the copious amounts of food.

No more goblincock (hot dog on top of burger and not that great) and they added an Arkansas burger with wine bbq sauce which my husbers said was pretty good. I had the metallica spicy buffalo burger which was my regular and it was still the same. I like that they now serve regular ketchup with the fries not spicy ketchup.

Taking a look around, I could already tell this was going to be a while. The place was packed! Metal music blasted from the speakers (which you get used to after the first 15-20 minutes or so). I started trying to scope out a bar stool in anticipation. She told me a lot of people at the bar were probably waiting for tables and would clear out in a bit. Yeah, that bit turned into almost an hour. A smarmy long haired rocker patron who appeared to carry himself with the air of being \"a regular\" rolled his eyes at me when, after offering me passage to the bar, I told him I was waiting for a seat.

I asked the patron at the next bar stool if anyone was sitting there. He said no. VICTORY! I snatched the seat as quickly as I could, ordered a local beer & readied myself to order. I'd already peeped the menu and wasn't going to delay getting my grub on any longer: I ordered the namesake Kuma Burger and prepared to wait another 20 minutes for it to come out of the kitchen.

This place is banging! There's always a line anytime of day and time. I read reviews and the website and was excited to try out this place but didn't want to wait in the massive line. Yesterday I was getting out of work and my friend said he drove past this place. He said that there wasn't a line and that we should go check it out after I got out of work. I was game. I worked all day and was pretty hungry. <br><br>So a few things to get out of the way. This is a really small, tight place with a small kitchen so you have to have some patience. I can totally deal with that and appreciate it. If you can't tell by the menu, the surroundings and the music it's got a heavy metal rock theme. There's all kinds of random, dark art work everywhere and the music is really heavy and super loud. It was hard to talk to each other without shouting. We were sitting right next to each other at the bar. It was loud. These were the downers for me but it won't stop me from coming back. Now on to the food and the service. <br><br>As I mentioned above there's always a massive crowd and line. We got lucky and got there before the crowd started. It was about 7:30 on a Tuesday. We walked in and the hostess asked if we wanted a table or if the bar was OK. We're always down for the bar especially since it was just 2 of us. She quickly shooed away 2 people and there we were with our seats at the bar. We were overwhelmed with the drink and food menu and had a hard time deciding but we made our final decisions. We decided to order and appetizer and a burger and split everything. Let me tell you that was a really smart decision on our part. I had a hard time because I wanted to try the mac and cheese that I had been reading about and saw on the menu. I saw an order of it come out and it was massive! Everything that I saw coming out of the kitchen was massive. Back to the mac and cheese, the best part is you get to pick 2 of your own toppings on it. I'm coming back to check that out. <br><br>They have a really great beer selection of all craft, no main stream beer. This I can appreciate since I just moved here. They also have a full bar for those of you that need some real booze with your food. Our final decisions were the BBQ Pork Fries and the Mastodon Burger. The fries was a mountain piled with pulled pork covered with BBQ sauce, Jack cheese and garnish of green onions. This was seriously a mountain of goodness. The fries were crispy, BBQ sauce was the perfect tang and sweetness, cheese was melty and the green onion added a nice touch. Oh so good! The Mastodon Burger was composed with BBQ Sauce, Cheddar Cheese, Crispy Bacon and Crispy Fried Onions. We had a choice of fries or chips. We opted for the chips since we had fries. The chips were house made so they were crispy and greasy. This burger was massive and AWESOME! BBQ sauce seemed to be the theme in our meal. It was a great touch with the perfectly cooked burger. The crispy onions added great flavor and texture and anything with bacon makes it better. Love this burger! We finished our burger but we were still left with our mountain of BBQ Pork Fries staring us in the face. We couldn't do it. We took it home. Those fries could easily feed up to 8 people for some fun sharing.<br><br>Bar service was decent. Since it's a small place with a small bar it's easy to grab the attention of the bartender. The atmosphere aside I'm definitely coming back because there's more food I want to try. If you check out this place make sure you plan ahead and fast for like 2 days.

This old school bar has become a well-known burger place in the Chicago area. Kuma's Corner is not like an ordinary burger spot because of the music, they play heavy metal. <br><br>At first sight, you will notice the gold doors and red drapes. Upon entering you <br>can sense the inviting atmosphere. At first glance the inside of Kuma's looked small. The tables seem piled up on one another. The bar and grill take up about half the space. After my friend and I were seated we were given the menu. When I skimmed through it I was confused. The burgers' names were based off of classic Rock Bands. ABSU, Black Sabbath, Goatsnake were a few of the burger names on the menu. My eyes opened wider and I thought to myself that's pretty cool. As we looked through the menu we found what we were going to order. Waiting for our server I looked around the restaurant I saw slogans on the back of employees shirts, albums placed on the walls around the restaurant, and tattoos on employees. As I compared Kuma's Corner to any other burger joint I have been in, I could tell right away this was a unique place. We ordered the chicken tenders, Iron Maiden burger, and the Slayer burger. After, we placed our order we <br>started to talk and for the most part we could hear each other pretty well. Even with the heavy metal music playing I was able to have a good conversation. Even though this wasn't my type of music, the environment of Kuma's still felt comfortable. This is somewhere to go to have a good time with friends. Once the chicken tenders arrived they came covered in a mild spicy sauce. Just cutting in it I could see the juice slowly drip down. As I bite into the soft chicken tender I felt the <br>juices flow all over my mouth. Once I was done with the first bite I was just amazed on how good they were. <br><br>Shortly after devouring these tenders, the burgers came. I took a moment and took a deep breath. I noticed that it smelled like smoke, I guess it was because the grill was so close to us. Despite the smell, the burger looked amazing. It was a well plated big burger with a generous amount of fries. Once I took a bite of my Iron Maiden I knew I will come back here with my friends and family. It had spicy mayo, cherry pepper, pepper jack, avocado, fresh lettuce, tomato, and onions. Every time I took a bite the meat would slowly melt away in my mouth. My taste <br>buds were a place they have never been before. Despite having a great burger I really did not like the fries too much because they were too salty, but nothing a little ketchup couldn't fix. The waiter noticed my drink was getting low and promptly refilled it for me. <br><br>Overall, my experience at Kuma's Corner was a great one. The waiters are friendly and prompt. Even though it is a bit expensive I know that the burger was worth every penny. The atmosphere is different but still very enjoyable.

These are all the hallmarks of a place that's invented a persona for itself. Of particular note, the rules state that no Miller or Budweiser shall be served. Because obviously, a place like Kuma's is way too cool for those kind of plebeian horse urine beers. And they do, to their credit, have a good looking beer selection. Except: they have PBR available. So, you're saying that a non-discriminating beer drinker (and I know guys who just don't like beer all that much, and are perfectly happy with your run of the mill American beers) can't get a Bud or an MGD, but super hipster PBR makes the flavor and sophistication cut? Get over yourself. <br><br>Now, further complicating things is the \"Die EMO Die\" scrawled in chalk above the bar. I hate Emo too. But guess what, I see a lot of those kids pounding PBR. So do I award some brownie points for senseless Emo hate? Or get confused at luring them in? <br><br>We came on a Saturday, like fools, and waited about 90 minutes for a table, but whatever. It's a thing, right? While we waited, we watched Hero and Ninja Scroll on the TV over the bar - kind of a martial arts themed night. <br><br>To the burgers: Good. Quite good. And big. My \"Lair of the Minotaur\" was excellent, with brie, bourbon soaked pears, sauteed onions, and bacon. I ordered the burger medium rare, and it came pretty pink throughout. Fine by me, but if you're used to restaurants overcooking at all levels to save themselves a lawsuit, you might want to order one level more done than you are used to. The burger itself wasn't too heavily seasoned - which was nice, considering none of my toppings are particularly strong - it was good not to lose the flavors in a bunch of seasoned salt. Others enjoyed the...something...with goat cheese, tzatziki sauce, and kalamata olives - very good. And...the Slayer, which was, no joke, a huge 10oz burger smothered in chili and sausage links. The chili was probably about 75% meat by volume. The chili was good, too. Spicy, not too onion-y, not too cumin-y. <br><br>Finally, a \"make your own\" mac-and-cheese was tasty with prosciutto and mushrooms. Sprinkled on top was a good handful of scallions, which makes the appearance of scallions as an ingredient choice kind of interesting. I guess if you really like scallions? Anyway. The cheese was tasty, and the pasta was al dente - a good job all around, and a good option for those not looking for the meat sweats. <br><br>I was a good boy, and I ate the whole burger...and followed that up by being uncomfortably full for the rest of the night. At $11, this is a lot of food - you could cut this in half, eat one piece, and be full, then eat it again the next day. So maybe look at it as a couple $5.50 reasonably sized burgers? <br><br>Usually, I would say I'd go back. But honestly, it's pretty inconvenient to wait that long, and I'm unlikely to make it back down on a weeknight when the wait is shorter. So, through no fault of their own, I would have to be taking out of town guests back to make this trip again.

Now if anyone reading this has been to Matt's Big Breakfast out in Phoenix, you know that there is about a 30 minute wait on a good day. Kuma's is no different. We arrived and were immediately on a waiting list for 30-45 minutes. Waiting to be seated was the only complaint from me, and that complaint is very, very trivial because the food blew me away...<br><br>We started with some fried calamari and hot wings. Both were fantastic! The wings weren't chicken wings...instead, Kuma's has class and offers a whole turkey wing! Wait, there's more... It's served with a truffle sauce. Yes! A truffle sauce. The owner of Kuma's knows his stuff. I was not expecting anything that fancy. So, I'm already in awe about everything so far and then I get my drink. I tried a new beer that I had never had before, but the waitress recommended. It is called Trois Pistolas, and it has been my favorite beer ever since that day.<br><br>Alright, alright... So far I've had an amazing set of appetizers and have been introduced to my new favorite beer. Now, it's time for the burgers. I sampled three but ate one to completion, and that one was: The Lair of the Minotaur (Caramelized Onions, Pancetta, Brie, Bourbon Soaked Pears). It was unbelievable! I also got a chance to try the Slayer (Pile of fries topped with a  1/2 lb. Burger, Chili, Cherry Peppers, Andouille, Onions, Jack Cheese, and Anger) and the Pantera (Roasted Poblano Pepper, Bacon, Chedder and Monterey Jack, House made Ranchero Sauce, Tortilla Strips). Every bite was mouthwatering. I could taste the creativity of each burger, and none of them tasted alike.<br><br>There is a lot more to say about this place and I will update this review if I can think of more key points to add.

Not a problem for those of us that eat anything that doesn't move! <br><br>There are so many places to get a \"good burger\" and why go to Kuma's over an alternative gourmet burger place with no wait?

I had the Mastodon, which comes with bacon, cheddar, bbq sauce and fried onion strings on a pretzel roll. I skipped the fries and went with the house-made potato chips. They were excellent but could be extraordinary if they served them hot. I suppose the small kitchen prohibits it. The burger was fantastic. The medium rare patty was a bit overcooked, though. Not terribly, but enough to notice. The combination of fried onions, bbq sauce, bacon and cheese on a burger is a classic one and Kuma's version is one of the best.<br><br>They also have several local (Midwest) beers on tap along with a few microbrews from around the country. I had a delicious IPA from Michigan, I believe, and a draft root beer from Wisconsin- also delicious.<br><br>The list of rules is mostly based around food service but there are a few zingers in there about no ranch dressing, no games on the TV, no Miller or Budweiser, etc. Things that most hipsters find clever, but in reality are kind of lame. It's weird, I got this angry vibe from all of the written paraphernalia, like the list and their website (all caps diatribes about how you should spend your money, what music to listen to, shop local, etc.), but the folks working there were as sweet as could be.

The hostess was your typical tattooed, Goth, rocker, heavy metal, lookin chick, she said \"how many?\", I replied \"Three\" only to get told it would be an hour wait. I was starving, there was no where to stand (or sit) unless you like corners and you feel like you can't breathe. <br><br>The hostess was nice though, she joked with us about how people should review the place before they come, they should be considerate and come in, sit down, eat and get the hell out, LOL- of course all due to the LONG wait time here. She then said the bar was first come, first serve, whoever sits down first gets the seat. Sure enough to our luck 15 minutes into our wait 3 seats at the bar were ready, we zoooomed in.<br><br>We sit. we were told by the bartender/waitress to move on over as much as we can due to the lack of space.

UHHH- ooook, so are you calling me frilly? I guess she was. Hm! We then ordered water. <br><br>All three of us order the Kuma burger which was by far YES ONE OF THE BEST ive ever had. juicy, perfect, tasty and did i mention the ketchup is like \"spicy and sweet\" MMMmMmMmMm sooo good. <br><br>THE SALAD IS OUT OF THIS WORLD. Its much better than any fries or chips as a side. The dressing is some sort of mint or basil and is so light and perfect with your burger. <br><br>We were done. Check came.

The problem was we where there with 8 people, which they wont sit a table for that many people, so we had to split up into 4 and 4, so it was going to be damn near impossible to get two tables next to each other. <br><br>On top of that we went there with some younger kids, age 9,7,6 and I completely forgot there was naked pictures of women on the walls...whoops :).

But besides that one issue, the pretzel bun, burger, bacon were stellar as usual and the bbq, instead of catchup, was a superb choice by them. Honestly, I would stay away from this burger, unless you really really love onion strings, and this is the only reason i gave it a 4 instead of 5 stars. Also, they did change the fries from waffle fries (which I was told were frozen) to a fresh-cut fry. I am still of fan of the waffle fries, regardless of if they where frozen or not.

Cream cheese and chorizo, stuffed into jalapenos, breaded and fried, with this amazingly sweet and spicy raspberry sauce on the side. They are literally my favorite thing to stuff into my face. My boyfriend wasn't interested (or worried I was going to stab him with a fork) and the roommate and her man were saving room for the BBQ pork fries (also amazing) which followed a few minutes later. <br><br>We DESTROYED our appetizers. It was a massacre. Needless to say, when burger time finally arrived, I barely had room for about a quarter of my burger. I appreciate the vastness of their menu, but I get the Pantera every time, and am hardly ever disappointed.

I was so excited to try this place and when I got here, I didn't mind waiting two hours to get my mouth on their tasty burgers. What an interesting concept of combining a bar that serves burgers with a rock band/horror film theme. I don't even know how to describe this place, you just have to see it for yourself. While the wait is terrible, the staff is friendly enough and try to be as accommodating as possible. It's basically first come, first serve. <br><br>When I first took a look at the menu, I didn't realize what was so special about their burgers. Sure, they had funky names, but some of their ingredients resembled those found at Red Robbin. I know now that what I just said would be considered blasphemous. They aren't just considered the best burgers in Chicago for nothing. I had my taste of three different burgers here. I know, you can save the fatass comments for later. My favorite has to be the YOB. The smoked Gouda is undeniably delicious and the roasted garlic mayo is outstanding. Next, I tried my hand at the Plague Bringer. I am a lover of spicy foods so it was natural that I would try something that had pepper jack and jalapenos. In the end, I really liked it for its tortilla chips. Lastly, I tried the famous Kuma burger with the cheddar and fried egg. What was the secret to these delicious burgers? The meat was cooked perfectly and they were served on pretzel rolls. I love these pretzel rolls. The waffle fries were also excellent, but as I became more full, I found myself eating more of the pretzel roll bread than the fries. Since they have a denser texture, they don't get soggy like your ordinary bread rolls. <br><br>Lastly, I also tried the 'make your own' mac 'n cheese. I've never seen this concept before, but you can add ingredients to it up to a certain amount, then you pay a premium for each additional item. We went with prosciutto, sun-dried tomatoes, and scallions. I thought mac 'n cheese always needed bacon to be delicious, but those three combination of ingredients made it a winner. <br><br>This place might be the best burger place that I have ever had. I am salivating just thinking about the burgers.

We got the Lair of the Minotaur which has Caramelized Onions, Pancetta, Brie, Bourbon Soaked Pears ($12). It's everything you want in a burger. We also shared the Motorhead, which has Goat Cheese, Kalamata Olives, Oregano, Tzatziki, Onion, Tomato ($10). A Greek lovers dream! Juicy and delicious. Its messy and crazy tasty.<br><br>The burgers comes with fries or chips, I believe but they werent anything to write home about. Lets put it this way, I dont think you are going for the fries.<br><br>My only gripe is, perhaps being a Lakeview resident and all the sterotypes there, I cant dig the heavy metal music. I wouldn't bring family in here because it is just to ridiculous. I don't mind the kind of music, I mind the volume. When I sit there and get a headache (I am 26, not 86), I think we need to turn it down a few. <br><br>Turn down the music, get more tables you we add another star Kuma's.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "GREAT burgers and beer!  Trying to find parking kinda sucks but the food and brews are so worth it!", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "Tremendous!

She made a huge order but still had over $20 left on her card, and the world's worst waitress (see following rant) refused to let her keep the difference!

I see NO reason why a gift card can't be used more than once, especially when the card was purchased less than a month prior!

We were happy with the beer selection. They had quite a few choices you don't see around, so that was a happy surprise. <br><br>I had the monthly special burger. It was a take on \"Thanksgiving Day\" (I believe it was called the comatose, I could be wrong) But it was absolutely amazing. My husband is a meat eater and said he thought this was way beyond his expectations. He had the neurosis and really enjoyed it.<br><br>We cannot wait to go back and try something new.

Fortunately, you can substitute their looonnngggg list of burgers for chicken or garden burgers.

Can't go wrong with a chicken sandwich smothered in cheese, sauteed mushrooms, grilled onions, and more cheese! I was good and got a salad instead of fries, although probably didn't matter after all that cheese!<br><br>As expected, my chicken neurosis was absolutely delish...but it was the pretzel bread that really put it over the top! I would have been happy with just my own loaf of pretzel bread! <br><br>I'll be back to try their \"build your own mac and cheese\", and I hear they have some tasty calamari and mussels as well!  I should also probably mention (in case you didn't catch up from the other million reviews) that the wait is typically long, but go at noon on a Monday like we did and you should score a table within minutes.", "pics": null}}, {"review": {"des": "I know that one more great review of Kuma's Corner isn't going to make a difference, but this place is amazing.
